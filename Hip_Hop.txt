Thought they be shut down
And be up in class that clown
But got a need throw that muscle round
Stand up or tumble now got drama in abundance now
When thrown in deep some will swim and sure
Some will be sheep and that's sweet
If you got good friends
We not all born to lead so our feet just follow footprints
Pushed in a world where to conform is the norm
How quick your dreams can be torn
But when warned we ain't listening
On a course we're going to court is like a christening
Not sure where your mission went
Before it was different
Distorted cause you thought you ought to live for your list of friends
That's the real in you
Know that's the real in you
Break shackles of the ones that hold back and limit you
That's what's critical
Know that's what's critical
Empowered to make moves on your own
From shining up in first class
To finding a first love who lined up and burnt buds
Not coping when your folks split
Out unloading that blame
And that's the dumbest of games
Got no focus on clever that only motives vendetta
And all that self medicating on them potions an error
But when warned we ain't listening
On a course we're going to court is like a christening
Not sure where your mission went
Before it was different
Distorted cause you thought you ought to live for your list of friends
That's the real in you
Know that's the real in you
Break shackles of the ones that hold back and limit you
That's what's critical
Know that's what's critical
Empowered to make moves on your own
Or would you rather hear flows all entertaining now
That Muslims and Christians and Jews aren't so different
The rich only care if their sons getting blasted
Would you lie on your ass or try finding the truth
While most politicians evade all these questions
Most likely in that country slavery's not abolished
Are in a capitalist spin not attempting solutions
Would you fight injustice or conform to the system.
You can't believe everything that you see
Logos and slogans make you believe
Look in their eyes so evil and malice
Radio waves full of deception and rage
Follow me and pay attention to the way
They use suggestive thinking not blinking when they lie
About our innocent Palestinian minds
Endless nights I cry as I stop and ask why my people have to die
General Patriarch and I'm all up inside ya
Till I heard another utter your time is precious
Never was concerned with them worldly pleasures
But when I'm buried my words will be unearthed as treasures
Of Putting hands in the dirt to search for what's better
Thirsting for cheddar like a rat in a dumpster
And that gave me the hunger to rap with such thunder
Stumbles in my presence
A cunning young apprentice and still
My method is run until your breathless
There's nothing gained from something that's stress less
On every day we strain for this
And got to say there's been pain for this
Experience we gained from this
We so thankful... we never came up quick
Wake everyday and got to face some nonsense
Trying to take your conscience
Your brain can wonder
Sly rats and the type that like to wise crack
High cats smoking ice until their eyes black
Got you unable to write unless your pipes packed
And started shedding some light upon the right maps
On every day we strain for this
And got to say there's been pain for this
Experience we gained from this
We so thankful... we never came up quick
Pay the toll gate mate you've arrived in the west
Where affluence meets with survival at best
Guess who's live upon the set
Was sidetracked when I came in the place
So I had to pay for my major mistakes
Lived wild but now they got files on my name
Even ma knows now her child's come of age
So from the sunshine to the darkest of days
Went from basket case to master of a trade.
On every day we strain for this
And got to say there's been pain for this
Experience we gained from this
Sang thief's theme's... but said when he returns he'll get decent
Police said don't ever come on back to this district
He's kids can only have contact on the weekend
Some start as burglars
Then they get shoved with peers whose murderers
Its where that stairway to heaven's
A much larger and steep flight
And each night the mission is the same
Now his twisted in the game
And it's a bitch to get away
Trying to slay them demons that pushed him to these measures
Iv been trying harder not to fall
Got three kids and two jobs
Was a believer in true love
Her food does not grow on trees so she at hooters
Her sons sixteen he needs a tutor
Never was a boozer but now she drinks liquor in her room
Thinking her Mr is a fool
She's pissed off from the side of her porch
Wanted to study but her buddy's had distractions galore
But life in this jungle insights you to tumble
Iv been trying harder not to fall
Wishing it all to end
Enraged by the slaughtering
Talking to men with one choice to run off or defend
From the smell of blood violence is absorbed into the skin
And the thoughts of kids caught up should torture people to death
Now freedoms with them see if they morph and see any sense
Not all true pictures of war are drawn in the news
Jaded because we didn't hear them calls coming through
How we'd savor our days if we had to walk in them shoes
Countries can't build without support for the youth
They lost when their most important resources abused
When scores... are born only to be drifting to a noose
We're caught up in the pictures that they have shown us
And not the millions of innocents that been blown up
Cold hearts disconnecting us from our own blood
For their objectives its best that they blindfold us
We're caught up in the pictures that they have shown us
And not the millions of innocents that been blown up
Cold hearts disconnecting us from our own blood
For their objectives its best that they blindfold us
Certain things make me stop for a minute
Pops is no killer but had to put a knife to appendix
And enabled me to cherish every waking moment
We in that lucky country where your brains your main opponent
I made that focus outward cause to cope in our hood
Is easier than impoverished lands that go without food
A place we're survival is the prize
Just trying to make a shake of it
And yo you must be mistaking if you
Can't see your stake in it is greater than the vast majority
And you can stand there growling at authority
Is you can say what you feel
And they can't put you under lock and key
So many cats that let there souls run on empty it gets tempting
A place we're survival is the prize
Got pride in my birthplace but shame also resides
Many roads here paved with betrayal and genocide.
Didn't want another air raid waking him in the night
Our diggers stay allied it really is the bigger picture
Over lies they die its really so the rich are richer
We used to swim in these rivers now we afraid to fish
Take a trip and witness that beauty outside
Flicking through photos as our childhood starts to fade away
Many of our greatest days
Some of us lost hope and put our faith up in the latest craze
With something so potent they lost focus
Many dreams they went up in smoke
From the day they became a slave
Couldn't strain friendships and made it hard
To go against the grain
To get control then at best you must confess today
Barely a cent after rent in a mess you stay
If I could take your past and hold it where your eyes can see
To show you've joined a long line
That be folding up them brightest dreams
Sometimes the city can suck you in to its habits
Where it's easier to sink than to manage
Sometimes even the loudest people in a crowded place
Feel drowned out and start to think they're alone
Another day another broken dream
Don't know where to go
Don't know where to go
Sometimes the city can suck you in to its habits
Where it's easier to sink than to manage
Another day another broken dream
We try to bring them out the dark again but
Asking questions why the privileged waste
Since it got a grip on these streets and started clenching tight
Tensions increase and so has tendencies to crime
On those who were once the energetic type
No class or race divides this epidemic strike
But to reality many have shut the door
In this modern worlds new design
Where no one's got the time to try and stop em
Please take this mirror...
Please take this mirror...
Some claiming it's insane
Got many trying to cope
Got people trying to climb that be teaching to the blind
I can see it's high time that we need to define
Why people dying over resource exports
For how our brains stay drugged off the rhetoric
What we gonna obtain by shifting the blame
Will be living estranged as victims of change
Many are stained with souls corrupt
Hope they locate change when old enough
A message that I got when growing up
Is drink and smoke pot until ya throwing up
Wonder why I just wrote that bar
Where we living is poles apart
With open hearts I see people building
A bridge to the world to feed some children
A new light to lead some millions
We marching to a different drum
Drugs will bring you a fist of funds
But make your journey a twisted one
Just begun to see duty's change
Seek truth not pursuit of fame
Some choosing to fuel them flames
But they looking like fools today
Time to retrain mobilize
Them old ways have been pulverized
We got a new table to roll that dice
Inner demons like a poltergeist
Had us living so cold as ice
But now kids got global eyes
New ideas see these kids
Any girl any fella from a broken home
Anyone neglected in a warring zone
Lost their abode and was forced to roam
Still they spoke in the warmest tones
Kept hope as a cornerstone
From these gifts we ought to grow
I quit spitting them morbid poems
Like cortisones to stop the hate swelling
Still see pain in locked away felons
Still need change and lots of rebelling
We got to be heading in the right direction
And positive thought fights depression
And even scribes from the tribes of Judah
New ideas see these kids
Told her a change won't follow
I told her don't waste your time anymore
A renegade gotta face a change
Stay away from them wasted days now break
Keep drinking till that booze goes
Traveled more then a few roads
I stayed glad with the kudos
Grabbing at fools gold from that spot I couldn't move
We always blazed on the weekdays
And we normally sleep late pause then we replay
Sort of thought there'd never be change
We always blazed on the weekdays
And we normally sleep late
Pause then we replay. Sorta thought there'd never be change
I was caught up in fiction I lied to the world
Told her a change won't follow
I told her don't waste your time anymore
A renegade gotta face a change
Stay away from them wasted days now break
We got props for them hot bars
Been on dust like rock stars cuffed up in cop cars
Screaming out they should stop war
But every spot that we pub crawl none stop got brawls
Probably wasted a million
But I'm gonna build for my children
So what it took to be a man now is put some plans down
Never look for them hand outs
Many thinking you're at loss kid
Piss poor were them options naught in my pockets
Many thinking your at loss kid
Piss poor were them options naught in my pockets
Many thinking you're at loss kid
Piss poor were them options naught in my pockets
Since the call from the doctors
I had my bad thoughts packed all into boxes
I was caught up in fiction I lied to the world
Told her a change won't follow
I told her don't waste your time anymore
A renegade gotta face a change
Stay away from them wasted days now break
So I told her I'm switching up
So I told her I'm switching up
I told her a change won't follow
Stay away from the wasted days now break
I told her a change won't follow
Stay away from the wasted days now break
I told her a change won't follow
Stay away from the wasted days now break
I told her a change won't follow
Stay away from the wasted days now break
Give us a way out... way out...
Give us a way out... way out...
Some it's how they brought up
Some they got caught up
Some they been tortured
Their thoughts stayed dormant
Then they started morphing
Got hardly any caution
Was buddy's now we awkward
Many like porcelain cracked in an instant
Poor to rich kids the off balance to the gifted
Mental states don't discriminate
That saw the fate of my many mates
On a steady chase inclined to celebrate on any day
To see the state of their minds and had to get away
No one demonstrates what to do in situations
In these cases when they talking too outrageous
So we soon became strangers
No one educates we knew none of the dangers
She never lets him see inside
And he don't ever see the pain that's caught inside
If she could see the world through his eyes
And she don't ever see the pain that's caught inside
We don't ever see the pain that's caught inside
We don't ever see the pain
Spent days trying to control that thought train
Trying to find Nirvana some end like Cobain
Some go bananas can't vent so pour blame
Scientists been trying to get the core of this
Unlocked doors but be stuck in the corridors
Horrors of dealing with the unknown
Think your alone but don't know who followed you home
She never lets him see inside
And he don't ever see the pain that's caught inside
If she could see the world through his eyes
And she don't ever see the pain that's caught inside
Before some ever get to live walls collide
And we don't ever see the game
Before some ever get to live walls collide
And you could be the one that saves me
I feel the truth confirming lately
You could break me out this daydream
And you could be the one that saves me
Living in my world you know is crazy
You could break me out this daydream
Whether we stay broke or destined for payloads
I've been wasteful lord is my witness
Felt my brain was borderline twisted
So far from sane when your at a distance
And you could be the one that saves me
I feel the truth confirming lately
You could break me out this daydream
And you could be the one that saves me
Living in my world you know is crazy
You could break me out this daydream
I've got a thirsting for the worst things
But I'm gonna turn things that's for certain
Hit my straps when they pull back that curtain
Still you're pushing me my dreams is your lot now
Most weeks I'm leaving to rock crowds
Try and pan some gold out
So the loads now bigger than I thought
And my remedies been drinking till I'm warped
Future I'd see was vivid in my thoughts
And when it blinded me you'd steer me the right course
And you could be the one that saves me
I feel the truth confirming lately
You could break me out this daydream
And you could be the one that saves me
Living in my world you know is crazy
Step on anyone on your mission to rise up
Human brethren have been listening to liars
Killing for wealth or religion is a virus
Rebelling from wisdom that guides us
No thought just war with opponents
Pay that mortgage with my bonus
No thought of where your home is
Gotta get my kids tuition
Hope the missile hits with precision
To stop a terrorist ambition
For better results you need to evolve to move me
To see that you fall too easy
Step on anyone on your mission to rise up
Human brethren have been listening to liars
Killing for wealth or religion is a virus
Rebelling from wisdom that guides us
Bombs loaded strapped to my vest now
So hopeless mad at the west now
Been told a bomb is my best route
Explode and God he will bless thou
My lands under occupation
And we're branded abominations
For better results you need to evolve to move me
To see that you fall too easy
For the plied of the righteous ones
For the plied of the righteous ones
For the plied of the righteous ones
For the plied of the righteous ones
You in a palace or house in ruin
But we grinding out solutions
Inner peace can be illusive
When following dreams so ruthless
But family be crucial
Can see that I've been clueless
To the truest of epiphanies
That switching you to my centerpiece
Would come renew that energy
Still love my boozed up memories
Of cigar fumes and Hennessey
I drafted new itinerary
A blueprint for future legacy
So fearless and all the fear is gone
So fearless and all the fear is gone
Once based my days on chasing fame
And chasing dames to make a name
My soul became a vacant place
Then over came a saving grace
After all the labor pain a heart
Could never stay the same
My path it did fade away
A starring role nature played
Grasping on a razor blade to check
Pacing in that hospital
Waiting on a doctors moves
I can take a knock or two
But to hold a tears impossible
It's time to be a rock for you
Strength has come and I'm leading
Strength has come and I'm leading
So fearless and now the fear is gone
So fearless and now the fear is gone
Strength has come and I'm leading
Strength has come and I'm leading
Many got degrees but don't know what knowledge is
Acknowledge his dedication to the truth
And he never changed name just for chasing lute
So today he remains of the few
Not the news that your seeing on fox
Believe it or not he's a prize winning professor
Been a front line eye witness to terror
Been threatened to leave countries
And had death threats
Made me believe how we deceived by you west press
And now I know why these secrets are best kept
Right after his readings I be needing a stress test
A best bet for those not familiar
Real heroes are hard to come by
The human race would rise as one kind
If these lies hypnotized our young minds
Born to a tribe in a south Africa village
In a country wealth but without any privilege
His land pillaged by settlers with greed on their mind
They showed no respect so no peace he could find
Be a lead to the blind so his people would climb
Free speech was a crime in the time that he lived
Apartheid had people divided by skin
And not a guy to give in on a quest to be free
Twenty seven years of life in a penitentiary
Without fail we raise a glass in health to this fella
The selfless path of Mr. Nelson Mandela
Real heroes are hard to come by
The human race would rise as one kind
If these lies hypnotized our young minds
Real heroes are hard to find
With super powers that really exist
That influence the hearts of men
Who could you turn to
If we did not have direction and inspiration
Real heroes are hard to come by
The human race would rise as one kind
If these lies hypnotized our young minds
We gain benefits from a nemesis
We brought that harder edge to the penmanship
See every breath brings you pestilence
To ridicule and finish you
We not criminals but we sinners too
And patience that's left is so minuscule
It's been a few and we let it slide
But friendships are not standing the test of time
Consequence as we sever ties
To hold a grudge is a potent drug
Such phony fucks gone and blown the trust
You find pleasure in tearing down
All that we burn for but I found
Freedom in closing the door
We're militant with diligence our innocence
Killed by the villainous
To build again is real revenge
Take your thirty pieces of silver man
Middleman with little scams
That give your kicks like a river dance
We killed your plans of milking bands
Truth serum is piled in this pen of mine
From venomous smiles and pathetic lies
Like Gemini's with many sides
Their energy spent where the pennies lie
Now for attempts we be very wise
You find pleasure in tearing down
All that we burn for but I found
Freedom in closing the door
Memories here be so bitter sweet
You're taking our dreams to the guillotine
Memories here be so bitter sweet
You're taking our dreams to the guillotine
Memories here be so bitter sweet
You're taking our dreams to the guillotine
Memories here be so bitter sweet
You're taking our dreams to the guillotine
Memories here be so bitter sweet
You're taking our dreams to the guillotine
Memories here be so bitter sweet
You're taking our dreams to the guillotine
You find pleasure in tearing down
All that we burn for but I found
Freedom in closing the door
No mansions or supped up whips that cash ain't ruling shit
Could hang on crucifix to give thanks to the crew I'm with now
And we back from breaking point that spot still vacant boys
Waiting for the day that our flame is out but I spit propane
Cremate the crowd driven to destroy a nations doubt
I deliver like a boy on a paper route
When the rhythm breaks
When the rhythm breaks down
When the rhythm breaks
9 activists killed in an aid flotilla
Independence is a monstrous death game
They killing in Iraq for black gold
In Nigeria they killed stacks for black gold
They killing in Chad for black gold
Mexicans kill trying to run the drug trade
Tell me your kids don't love the blood games
Sometimes we might joke sometimes we might cry
Just making the most of living our lives
Sometimes we get low sometimes we get high
Sometimes we might joke sometimes we might cry
They killing over diamonds in Africa
Killing in another Thailand massacre
Kill you if you drop dime on the mafia
Television kills mind and character
They killing in Somalia's blue waters
They killed in Bosnia for new borders
They kill you for dishonor in Jordan
A family name has got such importance
They killing in Columbia for coke
Main killer in Down Under be the smokes
They killing journalists in the Russian lands
There's killers for god in Jerusalem
Sometimes we might joke sometimes we might cry
Just making the most of living our lives
Sometimes we get low sometimes we get high
Sometimes we might joke sometimes we might cry
Sometimes we might joke sometimes we might cry
Just making the most of living our lives
Sometimes we get low sometimes we get high
Sometimes we might joke sometimes we might cry
My eyes haven't spoken
And the thoughts of forever started choking
While fear is sounding
Even in the worst of times worth saving
Lost in my head in a Ram Jam party
Cosmic encounters of an everyday kind
We can't lose what we can't find
But dig this recital.
The ills of the world make the situation lighter
With the smash of a hand and a little toe tap
Indicates to the brothers that we be on the flip tip
Constantly rude as some sort of tribal terror
The street can't depart from the bloody heart
The tribe who meanders with drunken propaganda
Keep it in boom and never will we slander
Money gives a nudge to the poet star bandit
Mysterious is the tribe for we choose it
Hop inside the bed and pull over the covers
This society of fake reality
Through the Mr. Crazy Rabbits who were always on his tail
Get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail
They'll put you back to France on a ship with a sail
Came to America to find liberty
Succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back
This is a song that is long and prolific
Think of the stuff that I said if you can
If you go to the store for me
Sympathetic reason in the case of the blues
Jolly like a jumping bean or a jester
Ten after one I think I'll hop the horse
Downtown late of three of course
Just came from fishing couldn't get a catch
Downtown they'll probably have a batch
A whiting sandwich and a Guinness Stout
But with the beer though I had a bout
So I exchanged it for some apple juice
I had the blues but I shook them loose
A jeep is blasting from the urban streets
Loots of funk over hardcore beats
The moon dabbles in the morning sky
As the minutes just creep on by
I get a thought and hear comes my Tribe
Ritual shakes and in good vibes
Like always the Quest begins
We find a spot and we sit and chat
Speaking on the status quo of rap
We pay attention to the words he read
When he was done we rattled on
There was no lunch because it wasn't dawn
We pointed things out about this times
Gotta be swift society
The man whose made is the man who maxes
The grounds for living are being discussed
As we go it gets close to dusk
Gather thoughts and savor breath
Cause there's only a few hours left
The human hours are here to stay
Girls be screaming on this conversation
I have my two cents for a revelation
I hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles
It probably moves with the morning wind
Trying to remember someone's name
So hear the frogs dancing in the streets
Once again Ali will bring up the beat
The beat is over and so is the night
The sun is risen and the shine is bright
We all say peace and go our separate ways
Youth is fading as we gain our days
As we go you hear a gasp of laugh
As we start up our rhythmic path
As least the beat will combine
Well can I get a level on the bass and on the treble
You must container that at least to dip your hand in rap
The rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted
All over the earth if we can get there first
If you want protection you can hide behind the shield
You can game on the gallons if you really need to rock
You will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail
But dig it in the ground because the foot print now
Rub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place
When you get your finger on the music it'll linger
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
She made a big mistake by leaving me home
I had to roam so I picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around
My mother left a yard but I needed one more
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks
Ali laid in the back so he can get rest
Drove down the road for two days and a half
The sun had just risen on a dusty path
Just then a figure had caught my eye
A man with a sombrero who was four feet high
His index finger he tipped up his hat
Anyway a gas station we passed
We got gas and went on to get grub
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
Anywhere would have been better
Ali had the fruit punch
When we finished we thought for ways to get back
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked
Beautiful lady she was a waitress there
Put the wallet down and stared and stared
I checked for keys and started to step
Had my jimmy hats I got to get it man
I feel bad but he makes me feel badder
Three days coming and three more going
We get back and there was no slack
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Looked at her sexual partner
Who acquainted her acquaintance
Five hours ago at a disco
But it seems that she's done the same
And now something has happened
By something that has been attracted
She poked and poked and smacked at it
Then she broke down and she scratched it
Then he picked up a pair of forceps
Her pretty face showed fright
A really grim picture is painted
Let me tell you more about pubic enemy
Old King Cole was a merry old soul
Get lots of love and he couldn't digest it
Schemed and schemed like a crack fiend king
He hold the crown but not the jimmy hat
Now he wears a frown and the jimmy hates that
So the fair maiden in the royal bedroom
She ignored and walked through the gate
The king is in the kingdom to await his fate...
Of the enemy The Pubic Enemy
A horrible creature that must be penetrated
How he lives and how he go
Watch yourself when you're out on the run
There's four friends of mine that thought they were bad
They scratched and scratched like it was Saturday and...
Listen here. This is Cool DJ Red Alert
There's only one thing I gotta tell ya
Ain't no need to question the authority
If only you could see through your elaborate eyes
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
As the Tribe flies high like a dove
You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major
As you inhale like a breath of fresh air
Socialistic and eccentric
Original and designative
Politicians are magicians
They all amount to crap that's heard
Here's the edge that you will savor
The economy... politics... police... everything
But the youth about to come back
19 years is a youthful lesson
Can't you see what lays inside babe
The head is bred to let the thoughts grow
Sleet and snow and storms can't sever
Negatives have been rejected
3-6-5 straight out the bottle
I prefer the second for ghetto tracks
A mass of peers in celebration
Beyond existing forces of life
And if you wanna get the rhythm
Then you have to join a Tribe
The Native Tongues are about to proceed with the usual lingo
Devoted to... the art of moving butts
The Tribe has been on hold for much too long
Don't fear the rhythm because it's strong
Took the crust away from the third eye lid
Rhythms of the Tribe which is passed out right
Rhythm is the key as we open up the door
The ghetto beat with a ghetto poem
If you feel uptight and you need to freak
It'll be all right once we drop this beat
We Quest around for the musical hard
Got the instinct to travel miles and miles
Gotta whole lot of room for piles and piles
Will we be on point for the ninety deck
Issued rhythms that are on the rise
Some veggie links and some fish that stinks
Smelled like she conjured up a mouse
Strictly collard greens and a occasional steak
Candied yams inside my tummy
Apple sauce and some nice red beets
I like lemons and limes
Gum drops and gummy bears tease my eyes
A sight for sore ones and so are pies
And other goodies that are filled with goop
With fried apple roots
Pig in the pan or a pair of bogey chives
Pay attention to the Tribe as we impose
All I wanna do is get down y'all
Have a ball y'all and freak freak y'all
Lifeless ventures ain't new boo
Gotta get a grip like culture
The rhythms will lurk into people
All funk ain't created equal
Don't let the storm of life scare ya
For the days of grimness and oppression
Instrumental to be freaky
Go ahead in the rain and you'll see
Can't we make you see
Think about what's yours
I mean your culture and your laws
Stomp till your soul is lifted
Get inside the groove and get nasty
Money is a first on the list here
If you got the ride then ride it
Rock to the roll with the hair down
Read it to me will you please
Don't fix your lips to tell me you can
You're a fool of many in society
Only a fool as described by the Tribe
The young man aggravated grabbed him back and smacked him
He felt ashamed for what he had done
Slow down and think and take it cool
Back in the days when I was a teenager
Before I had status and before I had a pager
You could find the Abstract listening to hip hop
Doing what we feel for the music is the proof and
Deliberately cheered LP filled with street goods
If you dis... it gets drastic
Drifting toward an average of nothingness
Until it can be retarded for it's own destiny
TIME is an inanimate object
Praying and praying and praying with no justification for belief
We gotta be a winner all the time
Can't fall prey to a hip hop crime
With the dope raps and dope tracks for you for blocks
We on these Excursions so you must realize
So what can you do in the times which exist
You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
Whatever it may be in today's society
You must be honest and true to the next
Don't be phony and expect one not to flex
What you gotta do to is know that the Tribe is in the sphere
And white thigh supporters at night
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
I just try my best to like go all out
Right on the two inch tape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse to get my
Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
You can't get your own and that's pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If you do the result will end up kind of bugged
When I left for Rosie I was Boulevard status
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his baddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Or was it just because I used to swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
I go out with the strongest and I separate the evils
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out
Is what I don't allow so let me tell you something
Not too modest and not a lot of pride
Soon to have a ride and a home to reside
If my momma is sick I'm by her beside
Used to watch the show on channel 4 called Riptide
If there ain't no dough then there ain't no show
If you wanna see the people scream and laugh
You best Quest you ask the Quest you ask real fast
And the Abstract rapper says
Don't forget my pastry make sure they're tasty
I'm not the type to be pushy or hasty
See I'm the type of bro that's reared in the ghetto
Took a few shorts before
Now the only ones I take are the ones that I wear
Make sure you count your money real slow
We don't have to act like we in grade school
Just make sure that we're taken care of
1988 Senior Year at Garvey High
Where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
All the troopers round the way used to call her a ho
But deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go
I feel like Heavy D I need somebody for me
Yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
Your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
And if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you
If you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it
I had a dream about my man last night
And my man came by the studio
When it goes up in and fluctuates the diction
I must regroup my thoughts and kick the next ones for my people
Please don't be deceived by ugly slice of evil
The world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket
The thing that men and women need to do is stick together
Progressions can't be made if we're separate forever
I hooked this funky beat with the loop and the feature
So listen because the Quest is led through the underground
The Black and Puerto Ricans
Of the urbanized areas
This one goes out to my man
Thanks a lot Ron Carter on the bass
Yes my man Ron Carter is on the bass
Born into the 91 decade
You gotta say the Quest is on
Where you see the pretty girls
In the high animated world
Checking for a rapper with all the dough
If you take a shit they want to know
And prepare yourself for the breaks
It's the rap industry and it ain't that cool
Only if you're on stage or if you're speaking to your people
Especially on the industry side
Don't let the games just glide
They're giving you the business and putting on a show
You're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough
But you got a ho tickets backstage to a show
Sedated and at that fact they elated
The reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot
All you wanna do is taste the fruit
But in the back they're making fruit juice
You ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label
Feel it's time that I let loose the lion
And if not that then I'll commence to head flying
No more will I take the booty end of the stick
Bogus brothers making albums when they know they can't hack it
Now tell me I can't tear it up
Get a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs
Prefer to max on the side and let my pants sag
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have no loot
Although I hit a pound of herbs I'm still nice with the verbs
So fuck what you heard
The Born Cipher Cipher Master makes me think much faster
But critics still continue to plaster
My name and discredit my fame
All that shit is game
And I don't really give a damn
Eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham
A matter of minutes so it must be told
All that glitters not gold
You gotta get a label that's willing and able
When it comes to rhyming you gotta put your time in
Get a good lawyer so problems won't pile
We must have unity and think of the bigger plan
My hair is crazy curly
Do what the hell I want and have no one to listen to
I'm prompt with my business and I do things on the double
I wanna say peace and dedicate this joint to MC Trouble and to
This is for the slain rappers and the fallen rappers
You just gotta keep it happy and keep the vibes going
And this is Vibes and Stuff
Percentile rate of date rape is fat
Especially if a squad tries to cry out rape
So instead you rest your head on the arm of the couch
Envision in your head of a great sex bout
Should you try to kiss or head towards a hickey
Hit the road Jack and all of that
Right smack dab in the middle
Or better yet Magic or even Karl Malone
Do your thing at 12 o'clock and when you go again
I won't cry over spilled milk
If you won't let me take you to the Hilt
I don't wanna bone you that much
I'm not the type that would go for that
I'll have to fetch a brand new cat
I know because of your bloody attitude
I know why you act that way
It usually happens on the 28th day
I respect that crazily
When you're done with the past can you come check me
This ain't a joint to disrespect you
Because one head ain't better than two
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
And me the five footer
I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter
Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
So just clean out your ears and just check the word
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check it out Check it out
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all Play tapes y'all
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check it out Check it out
Back in days on the boulevard of Linden
Yo Tip you recall when we used to rock
Those fly routines on your cousin's block
I receive the message and you will play the sender
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed. I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
Or you'll be crazy sad and alone
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty
Record company people are shady
I don't doubt it. Look at how they act
Pass me the rock and I'll storm with the crew and
Gotta keep her beeper in her purse to make ends
Told her not to dis me I just want to be your love toy
Just because you rhyme don't mean I'll let you try me
Love the funky beats while she drive down the street
You don't have to say a word
Now I'm missing action for this fatal attraction
But don't you let me catch you with your joint up in these bitches
And don't you even dare to plan a plot upon my riches
She will never stop until she reach the top
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends
For we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist
A brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
We have no time to wallow in the mire
With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk
I don't really mind if it's over your head
But competition they must come straight way
But competition they must come straight way
I take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock
Make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut
Back and forth just like a Cameo song
If you dig this joint then please come dance along
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies
All my peoples in Queens ya don't stop
Now all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop
And all my peoples uptown ya don't stop
That includes the Bronx and Harlem ya don't stop
I said because Ladies First ya don't stop
And to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop
To my man Large Professor ya don't stop
Pete Rock for the beat ya don't stop
Everybody in the place ya don't stop
And last but not least on the sure shot
Gotta meet your lover at a quarter to 9
Keep my bases loaded like the New York Mets
At times I miss the pager so you don't get vex
They last for three weeks so they do me well
If you're in Costa Rica on a sunlit beach
People tend to think that a pager's foul
But it really hurts when you're on the prowl
Get paged by a G or a business pal
Game for the buzzer who kicked it to the losers
If you see a shrink he'll charge you a fee
If you see me ya see the fee is nothing
What to go what to go what to go what to go what
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so
But here's the real scoop
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
We're ill till the skill gets down
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no criminal
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear
So don't violate or you'll get violated
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego
Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Vocabulary's necessary
When digging into my library
Change your little drawers cause your pants are sagging
And have you smelling ripe like some old stale urine
Ripping up this dance just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
This is your midnight marauder program
I'm on the front of your cover
Step to me you're over
You better ask somebody on how we flip the script
Come to a Tribe show and watch the three kids rip
You know that I'm the rebel
Now I must move with the quickness
I'm radical with this like the man this song is after
Thanks for these bars on the Biko instrumental
I am recognizing that the voice inside my head
Is urging me to be myself but never follow someone else
Because opinions are like voices
We all have a different kind
So just clean out all of your ears
These are my views and you will find that
We revolutionize over the kick and the snare
There's room for it all as we mingle at the ball
Try to be the fattest is the level that we strive
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and your concubines
In my never ending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
You can be a Black man and lose all your soul
You can be White and groove but don't crap the roll
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
So next time that you think you want something here
Make something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Seven times out of ten
We listen to our music at night
Thus spawned the title of this program
The word maraud means to loot
This honey ripped me off for all my loot cakes
The car oh yeah there's money in my jacket
Cool I found something so I ironed it
Finally got what he wanted now he's good to go
One time the car was in the shop I had to borrow see...
They had no mercy on the car Leo will kill me
Stressed out more than anyone could ever be
Everybody knows I go to Georgia often
Got on the flight and I ended up in Boston
With all these trials and tribulations yo I've been affected
Coach sat me down from the ball team
Just because I rhyme she tried to soup me
She wasn't even all of that just another hooker
Just lay down your burdens by the riverside
Turn everything up in the headphones
So I don't lose my vocals
Posing like they hard when we know they damn card
My style is kinda fat reminiscent of a whale
Young girls desires for the females dreams
And being that we use it as a term of endearment
Now the little shorties say it all of the time
My style is kinda fat reminiscent of a whale
Young girls desires for the females dreams
If you came to the jam well I'm glad you came
But the night is on my mind
So parlay while I drop this rhyme
Shorty see the action and then start to mimic
Scam money don't make none
Hits the local bodega to woof down a hero
Conversation that he kicked to the shorty was a sly one
Came out on the scene as he told her to beep him
Saw his man Sam with the blunt in his hand
The night is on my mind
The night is on your mind
But now the night is on the mind
The night makes the aura and the J can't hack it
The way the moon dangles in the midnight sky
Serenity and sirens of the sounds and emotions
In the concrete jungle and the sun don't bungle
I think it's hard to find the words on how I feel
I paid about a deuce twenty for the Ampex steel
Too many candy rappers seem to be at the top
The music of our youth from 1979
Not every MC be with the negativity
I'm the cherry on the top of yo ice cream
I'm the wish you thought inside your dream
Listen to the way we pulsate the jam
Styles that we present are just a few
To do away with you and your hum drum crew
Black people unite and put down your steel
Ladies make a forum on your sexual drive
Devoted to your lover and make it thrive
Keep the poetry in my black knapsack
Hit the city streets to enhance my soul
I can kick a rhyme over ill drum rolls
I can do a trick with the opposite breed
Now it's time for me to take ya uptown
Street poetry is my everyday
If I was working at the club you would not pay
Told you in the jam that we can get down
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little something on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
But I couldn't drop dimes cause you couldn't relate
Take you on the ave and you buy me links
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood
Let's say we get together by the end of the week
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
They know the Abstract is really soul on ice
Shorty let me tell you about my only vice
It has to do with lots of loving and it ain't nothing nice
Cock is longer than the hat worn by Dr. Seuss
Love a girl in Daisy Dukes like them kids called Deuce
Kick the rhymes and more rhymes
Kick the beats and more beats
The Abstract intuition is very very worthy
I can feel ya out from Russia to Jersey
Please don't do the mute when you hear me on the juke
Hook up the beats at the funk manner
You know I'm gonna do it
Chemists get confused of my ill composition
This is the third of the new Tribe addition
And when your done with that then clap
Even in Santo Domingo when I got a Gringo
I like my beats hard like two day old shit
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me
For those who can't count it goes 1-2-3
Brothers find this hard to do but never me
I got a humdinger coming hook line and sinker
Down like a lady of the evening
When it goes in Toots just believe it's in
The title MC means Master of Ceremony
Don't come around town without the hip in your hop
The Tribe is good for your health like a can of Nutriment
Bring the blunts and the brew so
But the only thing I ask when I return from my task
I open up your pores like a plate full of collards
When we over joints like this we never cruddy
A first degree burn from my man Ken's cigarette
Once again the Ab is who you think of
It's Extra P and yo Tip I'm bout to set it
On the country once again here to win
There's 8 Million Stories in the city it's a pity
Don't fuck with the skins if she's trying to act shitty
Cause my man Extra P said don't say the years
Everybody in Philly rock rock on
When I speak of nation please don't make the deviation
Rebels of the party who create the jump sensation
Mind is a pit of different information
Microphone is on so of course communication
A Tribe Called Quest we on the run for whatever
Trials and tribulations that we have to endeavor
I can do a split and turn around like Alvin Ailey
But when it comes to days like this I got lyrics to go
Talk a lot of trash but no one can seem to beat it
But when it comes to nights like this I got lyrics to go
Lyrics to go Check it out y'all
Lyrics to go Check it out y'all
Lyrics to go Check it out y'all
Please proceed with caution cause the lyricist is fatal
Poetry machine with correct mechanisms
Immune to disease I defeat organisms
Always try to lead yo never will I follow
I got lyrics to go Everybody
I got lyrics to go Ah check it out y'all
I got lyrics to go Everybody
I got lyrics to go Check it out y'all
I got lyrics to go It's like that y'all
I got lyrics to go It's like that y'all
I got lyrics to go It's like that y'all
I got lyrics to go It's like that y'all
My best friend Steven at the Home Depot
And I'll dissect you like a fraction
Big up myself every time when it comes to this
The Ab doesn't study near nonsense money
Got the cutter of the box if a kid thinks he's ox
Long Island got a Zoo
Long Island... got the zone
Phony rappers who do not write
Phony rappers who do not excite
And this Puerto Rican kid said simple and plain
But I got to do this shit real quick so um
Then I came back and just fucked up his head
Couldn't hold the shit down in New York City
When this kid tried to tell me I didn't deserve my occupation
He said I wasn't shit that I was soon to fall
Of course he tried to bring it on the battling tip
Finally I banged his ass wit the verbal assault
That's when I preceded to give him what he needed
Because an MC like me be on TV
Don't mean I can't hold my shit down in NYC
Phony rappers who do not write
Phony rappers who do not excite
It seems there's a sanitation yard full of trash talkers
Sounding good but money can you feed the dog hawker
Talk about a world but in a form of rapping
Who will be the captain of this ship
Just because you rhyme for a couple of weeks
Let me stop sounding all bitter
But don't be a phony in the litter
Take it as a letter from the better
Or else I bend that ass like elbow macaroni
His rhyme style is older that a Chrysler Cordoba
I'm wilder then the cats from Arizona
You be the minor leaguer who sees no action
We'll have a forum to stand
But I praise Lord in the worlds that's unseen
And I don't give a shit about being wild rich
Just make me comfortable and I'll deal with it
Lay your ego on the ground so that you'll benefit
You can take these words and relay it to your click
Take some time for your mind and get off them head trips
Like the Fourth of July on some firework shit
My record company be on some true jerk shit
Got to redirect this vision
Got the beauty of a flower
Plus dimensions like a prism
Your minds are locked down like prison
Y'all really need to go lay down
Yo bust how we too strong to be broken
Occasional malfunction pressure time
For security we on this run like Logan
Don't ever try to think that you perfect
We all are human beings
There's bullshit at the surface
So jump back inside your shell
Let your million dollar thoughts propel
We slim with disabilities and
Thick with possibilities
We put these tunes out in record shop facilities
Let's strive to get this constant money activity
We try to stay on the scene like Fidel
So if you get enraged with these names it still rebels
There ain't no plan B's
Section Linden Boulevard
Section the whole Jamaica
We be the number one motivators
Ghetto mentality and the innovators
Some of y'all may really hate us
We be the crew that presents it on wicked instrumental
It's the four man fiasco in charge like Roscoe
Now you get the picture like Picasso
Now all you shorties move your ass while you puff weed
Is what you say when my love is in your mouth
To all my people across the state who sit back and contemplate
To all my people across the land who get their feet stuck in sand
I came to lead my team to victory like Hayden Fox
So don't shut down on the Razor
Let me tell you why I be the top dog in the industry
To all my people across the state who sit back and contemplate
To all my people across the land who get stuck in great sand
To all my peoples everywhere throw your mitts in the air
Featuring Consequence
It was Friday afternoon in the middle of June
Heineken bottle caps and the aroma of boom
Around the time everybody had just got home from class
Then he introduced me to that hydro smoke
See I never smoked before and my nerves got shot
Then he told me about the party at the spot jam rock
There's a joint around the way that's supposed to be real
Tonight is the night I get my groove on steady
And get my drink on with that Ford named Betty
The good shit that makes a kid lose his drink
Me and the fellas acted very irreverent
So let's step inside this corner so that we can rap on
Can't mess with these street sharks or these alligators
Other songs by A Tribe Called Quest
About the cats who be fronting
For all the goodness gracious
All across the wide spaces
Two people thinking as one so now he split
Any petty little bullshit you did will slide
Get on some grown man shit and let's knock on wood
But now seeing you baby in this stall out position
Wondering who's the dime piece that you're kissing
You night as well take the jigger and take my life
Get within the circle of my girl and make passes
Now you disrespected me and everything I stand for
Should I turn the other cheek or react and perspire
Don't wanna see myself in penitentiary attire
To bridge gaps in generations for future plantations
Nowadays I strive to be a very good influence
Even though not too long ago I was a truant
From man's obsession with money to holy prophets
Enemies they denounce me and my own try to sweep me
Gotta gotta stand clear of the pressure
Watch me bust they shit
I swear you do it to me every time
This is the year that I come in and just devastate
My rhymes are harder than last night's erection
My shit is lovely simply meaning that my joint is tight
Sometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block
But by the end of the day you'll be on my jock
And if you front I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest
Make sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper
The only tip I got for a waiter
Now I'm at a level supreme to the devil
So turn up the bass and lay low on the treble
The ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts
I swear you do it to me every time
But I can break a fella down like sex
Yo I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and
Forever writing never biting ain't shit else to do
But if they utter one word then it's as good as set
As for me see I just do how I love to do
Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along
And if it's real only then will you be on a roll
I try to stay on top my game there ain't no time to lose
I swear you do it to me every time
Featuring Consequence
Your new lesson is to realize the mission when you hear it
A weak foundation doesn't make a good home
That's why mine is built on chrome microphones
That'll keep you broke down like a horse 5 speed
We got reality for the carriage
Like Rampage with that Last Boy Scout appeal
That keeps everything on even keels
I keeps it realer than the logo on milk
I dedicate this to the posers that play hard
So he can peep the worldwide Willie that we display
But we gotta start with the spirit first y'all
Like an ill porno make ya body get wet
Just a ghetto child trying to live a straight and narrow
Hoping that my shit will pierce your dome like an arrow
All you negative feelings standing on two feet
Using every source of pain in my range to make it happen
And I'm doing my thing causing an ill commotion
You gotta come back and do the hop
Move till your body won't stop
Now that I got that out my system
Watch me stab up the track as if my name was OJ Simpson
I'm representing wit my crew
You must be mad in the head
You must be high smoking dust wit Chris Tucker
So come and pull your panties down
But don't bring your ass buying you ain't got no ends
Then you come back and do the hop
You know we come back and do the hop
You gotta come back and do the hop
The only difference of the two is the style of the rap
Another thing I'm not is a damn ass kisser
So listen to my words as I set things straight
Hip hop... a way of life
It doesn't tell you how to raise a child or treat a wife
I verbalize over... rhyme friendly
We got the illy team that doesn't even sweat the gleam
Keep jams packed and hotter than Havana
Positivity is the key in the lock
As we move with zeal and desire
Maybe that'll ease ya
Let me take this time to say R. I. P. to Phyllis Hyman
Who never got the props that she damn well deserved
I gotta brave heart like the one named Shirley Chisholm
Keep shit hotter... than a sauna
Bout to go to Union Square so I can see my care bear
Represent the Zulu Nation with illy rap creations
Sometimes men and women look at themselves and see bliss
Through experience we tend to exist
That's through our past or our caretakers
If you take all this away
And look at us at the end of the day
We stand great among creation
So baby take these words as a little inspiration
While I kick this shit get your ass motivation
Get in your ranks and tighten up as we walk through mines
Amongst a whole host of others
Yo all we wanna do is our thing and lay low
So brothers hold your heads high when you get down
But we can make it Sugar
Keep it light and I say
Move on through separate
Not together but together
And accolades of the crowd with our chests out proud
It's the rapper Abstract that make the joint get amped
Let me tell everybody from coast to coast
We got jewels and Mo and the life is tight rowdy
One is for the beat and the two is for the rhyme
All I wanna do is live life and be fair
I used to stress girls with long legs and long hair
God will never make it too hard for me to bare
The Westernized world got our minds confused
Government officials shoot their same old...
Made of devil agents a. k. a. the devil flunky
The positive jumps the negative like frogs
Tribe Called Quest situation
Power. People really get caught up with this
On different levels power controls your life
Money. The companion of the first.
Some people tend to worship and we know this ain't right.
Attitude is how I get my point across.
You can't call yourself an MC if you know that you're soft.
Aggressive... is how the stage is approached.
Whether it be you or all up in your past and...
But when they really need to put that shit background
If you're not original and you show no strategy
Heavenly... is how the track tends to flow
So sit and analyze the lyrical spray
Knowledge. When the mind accept facts
Ego. I'm on my own jock skill
When I'm in a rut and I don't know why
Try. Yo try again my friend
So sit and analyze the lyrical spray
When you're face to face with your adversity
We're gonna make this work out eventually
Yo I ain't one to complain but there's things in the game
Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender
But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride
Because I'm positive and seems that negative dies
I gotta see some loot so all my girls I blow
But I gotta steady freak these boys like Jojo
Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff
We gotta hold it down so we can move on past
Your vision of the mil got crept like Hey Lover
And all I want is my laceration of the pie
To get this whip cream before the water runs dry
Know we're gonna make it
What ya deal with... uh...
I make it easy for y'all to boogie down to
Promise that I will not answer
Through the music is our mission
There's a reason why we did it
Can you feel it when it hit right
Can you feel it when we do it
Here's another point for everyone to relish
When Ski busts his tools all y'all foes will embellish
And ya probably won't get enough
Do it with fun and patience
Get off your ass and let's start
Now you caught my heart for the evening
Should I just sit out or come harder
Your name is out my mouth like a ancient chant
Got me like a dog as I pause and pant
End of the day you're not mad at me
Now why you wanna go and do that love huh
Making things for me towards you harder
You doubts the whole vibe and it floats in the air
It's about time that you just unwind
Forever or however you want it
Maybe this'll change if you change your view
What is it that everybody has
And some pirates and thieves try to take
Half of y'all claim dog but now a light kitten
This is the lethal pop and you have no weapon
Can't we be cool instead of being foul though
Ghetto child dreams of fast cars and fast dollars
Impressions of live sometimes makes ya holler
Scream all that devil shit and talk like a scholar
MC from now till I get a frown
Shake that ass girl because you world renowned
Good girls usually got good game
Make this money without the friction
My whole crew got bumps on they points
The extra dick to blow up the pussy for the rest of the night
Two different toasters in your chest will make your shit hollow
Inside a zone then you feel that it's good
I bring the knowledge and wield the anarchy
In the place that gets you hot but leaves you here on the ground
Contenders don't you even think to challenge the crown
We the musical equation of the whole entire nation
To carry it you'd need a waistline the size of Big Pun
But I move crowds without a gun
Five hundred thousand units off a dime a trow
And best believe I went through more trees than Sonny
We was in the back of the joint cooling out
Asked her if she like it like that
That makes the competitors sound like this
With the songs we creating and musically relating
Meanwhile they boot shaking
On some funk shit faking
Here's a few who really come to do
What they say gonna do
There's no car branch
Everybody gonna move when we say move
Say yeah if you like it like that
Hell yeah if you like it like that
Tell me if you like it like that
Verse two if you like it like that
Elevate your thoughts on the vibe that we brought
While we climbing we shine like a super bowl ring
I mean hot like we do
It's a lot like we do and make your own mark
It's deeper than the song
Hope you live your life long
Smoking ain't a new sport
Smoke you sister in vendible
Enemies but yo I really don't wet that
We was in the back of the joint cooling out
You didn't want my... you didn't want it
We related and debated over food and tunes
But we gotta come through with common ground baby
But put it straight to your lover in life runs true
Fuck what you heard I'll make YOU a believer
Love my coffee dark so you can keep your dairy creamer
A word up a word up a word up a word up yo
And there was no concern about so and so
And these record companies
But now we all are grown
To everyone in the world
I used to ride a dollar van and really get my bus on
Keep the caller ID on the Motorola
Merrick Van Wig holler Shaft got brew
This is a place where stars are born
It would benefit you to keep a wide open lid
When we made love she made it shake like jelly
Told my man Louie that I really wasn't ready
This girl from my past had ridiculous ass
Walked down the hall with her stuffed up sass
Like a fiend with a queen when he catches the bird
Asked her about it and she used to say No way
Just another day but fight anyway
We put it down for the area crew
Looking good it you sipping on your brew
Met a shorty named Kenny from East Saint Louie
Worked in Saint Louis in her mother's hair parlor
Use to hit her man for cake to come see me
All of things they did not concern her
I'm the type of cat that brings forth the action
One more thing before you start cheering me yo
We put it down for the area crew
You're Looking good it you sipping on your brew
Bull shit over some bull shit ass reasons
We do it all for the love y'all
Love getting down and I love a cool breeze
And we do our thing for the one nine two
Love the circumstance to make my dough flow right
Love when my peoples come home from jail bids
Really love women and I really love kids
Love tight gloves where the music just bang
Love a women when she got a tight outfit
Outfit meaning outlook and disposition
Love peanut butter and jelly on wheat
From Ohio to Poughkeepsie
We do it all for the love y'all
We get the paper but it's still for the love y'all
From the heart inside of the heart y'all
If they call me and I don't call back
Got a twist to this shit and the answer's inside
Love it when my loved one really hold me down
We do it all for the love y'all
We get the paper but it's still for the love y'all
Just the love inside of the heart y'all
Me and my squad build just like contractors
While your thought you was out of copy I get nastier than sodomy
Was the degree of the economy that do the sovereignty
We never get concerned about who's in the league
The family is granite and you can't intercede
Poker face creed while my mind just read
Shorty got rhythm but her freak got freed
That's insignificant but this take heed
Beats from my fleet be sweet like Sugar Ray is
And what we want everybody out there to do... on the dance floor...
The fabulous what's the Scenario remix
Quick is how I flip from the tip of the lip
Milo in the dance is the new identity
So I can grow dreadlocks
This one two times nine on the Scenario
Eight black brothers in the public eye
So bust out the moves as you start to pursue her
Peace to Hood baby from the midnight crooner
Open up your mouth if you want the food
I see my influence still shining
This is the Lone Ranger
If you're one of the fortunate to purchase this
And hotter in the summer
Live your life right when you be corrupt
Volcano about to erupt
Got the motivating joints that keep your ass jumping
In come the bedroom dream
I kick it at a slow or at a quick tempo
I'm built for conflicts with chicks with issues
I can lick the wounds bring ease with miss yous
The beat make you bite your nails and shit your liver
And we gonna give a encore performance
Rock for an hour and he might rock longer
Open up the blinds and witness the dawning
The new application and I'm the applier
And I'm a set it off like fire
Now I got to urge you on to move ahead
Because we prone to make the party go
If you the baby daddy then uplift the kids
You dressed in black and been issued a coffin
From each little dash it get the whole smash
He just got results that's smiles and waved hands
Until we bounce to a autumn where hot weather
And still we'll be able to rock and rip crowds
Shake your money maker
Shake your money maker
Shake your money maker
I'm not Lawn Doctor so just step off with the hoe
Oops my mistake I didn't know you went with her
Should I run down the line of the all the kids that done hit her
But back to the subject you can't catch wreck
You think you're all that but you're girl's quite doable
So forget the chart because the action can start
I'm the undercover brother dump your hoe in the trunk
Save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers
The poems that I create ain't in paper back books
The poems that I create are for hookers and the crooks
If you step to this then the plot just thickens
I'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog
Makes me pick up and go when it's time to drop my rhymes
I'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic
Listen up everybody the bottom line
I like my beats harder than two day old shit
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me
But just in case I own more condoms than TLC
For those who can't count it goes 1-2-3
The answer... big up is how I be
Complimentary it be the thief of Poetry
My man Big Mo with the streets and caprice
See ya next LP and next CD and next cassette
We A Tribe Called Quest and we the Midnight Marauders
Tribe Called Quest and we the Midnight Marauders
Go to the record store and get the shit
We A Tribe Called Quest and we the Midnight Marauders
Queens got it's own and Brooklyn got it's own
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends
For we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist
A brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
We have no time to wallow in the mire
With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk
I don't really mind if it's over your head
But competition they must come straight way
But competition they must come straight way
I take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock
Make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut
Back and forth just like a Cameo song
If you dig this joint then please come dance along
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies
All my peoples in Queens ya don't stop
Now all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop
And all my peoples uptown ya don't stop
That includes the Bronx and Harlem ya don't stop
I said because Ladies First ya don't stop
And to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop
To my man Large Professor ya don't stop
Pete Rock for the beat ya don't stop
Everybody in the place ya don't stop
And last but not least on the sure shot
Yes I rock to the rhythm of a funky sound
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
The time is eternal when you play with the miser
The tantalizing wordplay yeah that's the joint
Sometimes I have to cuss just to prove my damn point
I write and recite to make good position
What you really need to do is just boogie your ass
How long did it take for you to see you can't rap
Go ask the last MC what happened when he said battle
I bust his ass in Cleveland now he's Sleepless in Seattle
See I kick the styles that'll make ya ass melt
Money on my mind so never mind a trick
Whether it be today or tomorrow
Oh shit check out what I saying
As I carry on with my proceedings
But before I be face to face
With my eternal resting place
I hope you find civilized every soul and every race
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
And me the five footer
I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter
Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
So just clean out your ears and just check the word
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check it out Check it out
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all Play tapes y'all
Check the rhyme y'all Check the rhyme y'all
Check it out Check it out
Back in days on the boulevard of Linden
Yo Tip you recall when we used to rock
Those fly routines on your cousin's block
I receive the message and you will play the sender
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed. I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
Or you'll be crazy sad and alone
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty
Record company people are shady
I don't doubt it. Look at how they act
Pass me the rock and I'll storm with the crew and
Ain't no need to question the authority
If only you could see through your elaborate eyes
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and your concubines
In my never ending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
You can be a Black man and lose all your soul
You can be White and groove but don't crap the roll
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
So next time that you think you want something here
Make something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Seven times out of ten
We listen to our music at night
Thus spawned the title of this program
The word maraud means to loot
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
As the Tribe flies high like a dove
You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major
As you inhale like a breath of fresh air
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so
But here's the real scoop
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
We're ill till the skill gets down
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no criminal
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear
So don't violate or you'll get violated
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego
Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Vocabulary's necessary
When digging into my library
Change your little drawers cause your pants are sagging
And have you smelling ripe like some old stale urine
Ripping up this dance just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
I just try my best to like go all out
Right on the two inch tape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse to get my
Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
You can't get your own and that's pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If you do the result will end up kind of bugged
When I left for Rosie I was Boulevard status
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his baddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Or was it just because I used to swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
I go out with the strongest and I separate the evils
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out
To people in the crowd I give what they get
Sweat like a peach and tart like a plum
A letter to the homeboy that freaked the head dome
The army wants me to drop my microphone
On the tour bus we hit the truck stop
Molecules of the land they uplift
Adrenaline now is crazy multiplied
With the quickness you bare the witness
Look what's in the mind and not in the brain
Right or left nut Ali plays the ace
Dribble hops out giggle yo proper term is laugh
Now if you'll excuse me
Street poetry is my everyday
If I was working at the club you would not pay
Told you in the jam that we can get down
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little something on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
But I couldn't drop dimes cause you couldn't relate
Take you on the ave and you buy me links
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood
Let's say we get together by the end of the week
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
They know the Abstract is really soul on ice
Shorty let me tell you about my only vice
It has to do with lots of loving and it ain't nothing nice
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends
For we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist
A brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
We have no time to wallow in the mire
With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk
I don't really mind if it's over your head
But competition they must come straight way

And to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop
To my man Large Professor ya don't stop
Pete Rock for the beat ya don't stop
Everybody in the place ya don't stop
And last but not least on the sure shot
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
She made a big mistake by leaving me home
I had to roam so I picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around
My mother left a yard but I needed one more
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks
Ali laid in the back so he can get rest
Drove down the road for two days and a half
The sun had just risen on a dusty path
Just then a figure had caught my eye
A man with a sombrero who was four feet high
His index finger he tipped up his hat
Anyway a gas station we passed
We got gas and went on to get grub
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
Anywhere would have been better
Ali had the fruit punch
When we finished we thought for ways to get back
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked
Beautiful lady she was a waitress there
Put the wallet down and stared and stared
I checked for keys and started to step
Had my jimmy hats I got to get it man
I feel bad but he makes me feel badder
Three days coming and three more going
We get back and there was no slack
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
I'm not Lawn Doctor so just step off with the hoe

I'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog
Makes me pick up and go when it's time to drop my rhymes
I'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic
Even in Santo Domingo when I got a Gringo
I like my beats hard like two day old shit
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me
For those who can't count it goes 1-2-3
Brothers find this hard to do but never me
I got a humdinger coming hook line and sinker
Down like a lady of the evening
When it goes in Toots just believe it's in
The title MC means Master of Ceremony
When you're face to face with your adversity
We're gonna make this work out eventually
Yo I ain't one to complain but there's things in the game
Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender
But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride
Because I'm positive and seems that negative dies
I gotta see some loot so all my girls I blow
But I gotta steady freak these boys like Jojo
Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff
We gotta hold it down so we can move on past
Your vision of the mil got crept like Hey Lover
And all I want is my laceration of the pie
To get this whip cream before the water runs dry
Know we're gonna make it
Through the Mr. Crazy Rabbits who were always on his tail
Get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail
They'll put you back to France on a ship with a sail
Came to America to find liberty
Succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back
This is a song that is long and prolific
Think of the stuff that I said if you can
If you go to the store for me
Sympathetic reason in the case of the blues
Jolly like a jumping bean or a jester
Read it to me will you please
Don't fix your lips to tell me you can
You're a fool of many in society
Only a fool as described by the Tribe
The young man aggravated grabbed him back and smacked him
He felt ashamed for what he had done
Slow down and think and take it cool
The only difference of the two is the style of the rap
Another thing I'm not is a damn ass kisser
So listen to my words as I set things straight
Hip hop... a way of life
It doesn't tell you how to raise a child or treat a wife
I verbalize over... rhyme friendly
We got the illy team that doesn't even sweat the gleam
Keep jams packed and hotter than Havana
Positivity is the key in the lock
As we move with zeal and desire
Now you caught my heart for the evening
Should I just sit out or come harder
Your name is out my mouth like a ancient chant
Got me like a dog as I pause and pant
End of the day you're not mad at me
Now why you wanna go and do that love huh
Making things for me towards you harder
You doubts the whole vibe and it floats in the air
It's about time that you just unwind
Forever or however you want it
Maybe this'll change if you change your view
Turn everything up in the headphones
So I don't lose my vocals
Posing like they hard when we know they damn card
My style is kinda fat reminiscent of a whale
Young girls desires for the females dreams
And being that we use it as a term of endearment
Now the little shorties say it all of the time
My style is kinda fat reminiscent of a whale
Young girls desires for the females dreams
If you came to the jam well I'm glad you came
Ain't no need to question the authority
If only you could see through your elaborate eyes
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo

Looked at her sexual partner
Who acquainted her acquaintance
Five hours ago at a disco
But it seems that she's done the same
And now something has happened
By something that has been attracted
She poked and poked and smacked at it
Then she broke down and she scratched it
Then he picked up a pair of forceps
Her pretty face showed fright
A really grim picture is painted
Old King Cole was a merry old soul
Get lots of love and he couldn't digest it
Schemed and schemed like a crack fiend king
He hold the crown but not the jimmy hat
Now he wears a frown and the jimmy hates that
So the fair maiden in the royal bedroom
She ignored and walked through the gate
The king is in the kingdom to await his fate...
As the Tribe flies high like a dove...
And you inhale like a breath of fresh air...
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so
But here's the real scoop
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
We're ill till the skill gets down
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no criminal
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear
So don't violate or you'll get violated
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego
Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Vocabulary's necessary
When digging into my library
Change your little drawers cause your pants are sagging
And have you smelling ripe like some old stale urine
Ripping up this dance just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
When you used to play your knickers and your pigtail do
I used to be all on it like a fly
I flirted and I flirted till there was no end
But she kicked the diabolical and said we was friends
In the words of the immortal Sweet Daddy
I'll take you to a place that's farther than the you know
Ricky D said we got to show and prove.
To the latest lambskins store get a six pack of hats for...
Even in Santo Domingo when I got a Gringo
I like my beats hard like two day old shit
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me
For those who can't count it goes 1-2-3
Brothers find this hard to do but never me
I got a humdinger coming hook line and sinker
Down like a lady of the evening
When it goes in Toots just believe it's in
The title MC means Master of Ceremony
It's time to go left and not right
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For Tyson types and Che figures
To make something happen
To make something happen
To make something happen
Let's make something happen
And promoters try to hit us with the art of war
Cracking off a Smirnoff to quickly turn to Molotov
Molotov the spaceship doors before that bitch is taking off
They'd rather lead us to the grayest water poison deadly smog
Leave us where we are so they can play among the stars
Used to see the TV screen as the place to land my dream in
And the car stereo where they would promote the show
Optimistic little brother with a hope you know
To the top of the State building claiming that that flag is mine
These notions and ideas and citizens live in space
Takes money to get it running and money for trees to fall
Imagine for one second all the people in poverty
Time to go left and not right
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Let's make something happen
Let's make something happen
Let's make something happen
Let's make something happen
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Let's make something happen
Let's make something happen
Let's make something happen
Let's make something happen
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers

For Tyson types and Che figures
Let's make something happen

The danger must be growing
For the rowers keep on rowing
And they're certainly not showing
But a giant step for us
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically
The fog and the smog of news media that logs
False narratives of Gods that came up against the odds
It's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars
You bastards overlooking street art
Dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division
The Tribe be the best in they division
Just another dummy caught up in the system
Verse getting that degree at Stanford or Harvard
Fourth grade reading level but he knows how to rap
Mouth translate happens organically
The media relates it what it thinks it sees
Judging steps in shoes of a path they never walked
Shot down in a blaze of a phrases is how they talk
Whatever will be will be
In the answer for cancer in a prodigious kid's mind
I just wanna feel as liberated as lions in Liberia
Let's see how well you know all your Tribe trivia
The man with a plan who made it real for us all
With a couple pound a weed and a couple dollar van
Earlier in the night when we bring out the music
With a box and a band killer sound boy movement
Live and direct when it all goes down
Big tune make the world go round
Make way for the sound boy crown
Don't you know we're the wickedest sound
One box off in your face make a sound boy frown
In just a few hours you're gonna feel the burn
All of the goons are checking their guns at the door
A solid wall of sound is here on tour
I'm in a world where my princess is Leia
And she's feeling my Vader and my lure grows greater and greater
You generational elitists have your chi in virtual think pieces
They are extensions of instinctual soul
It's the highest in commodity grade and you could get it today
One hitting reading pages of Poe
I be in NYC waiting for that law to pass
Like how we be skipping on beats like cooking crack in the kitchen
Student of the past trailblazing a daze
Not acknowledging a trend or swept up in a phase
We still the highest of commodity grade
Yellow accents on a dark bitch
I met her back when she kept all her carpet
I double dare y'all to fuck your plan B
Hoes in this bitch like a box of donuts
I pour out some liquor on a cop's grave
Three stacks said all this shit is fantasy
I see it like a kiddie on the carousel
I see us getting money through my green eyes
The spicy Popeye's and Red Lobster biscuits
Feel like I'm hungry now again
And I can't do nothing about it because my teeth are all rotted
And probably felt like a loner
Storming out my house and slamming doors like you paying bills
But what if they knew though and hit you with the cheat code
Leave you reckless on the court with no high percentage shot
Get rid of this tense and makes life make sense
As I come off the fence and break through defense
Anxiety is on the ropes and it's getting intense
My mother said a lot of wise words to me
I made her think she got to me following the trail of reefer
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind
Just wanna have shenanigan
Don't wanna make you mad again
So focus on the flattery you feel when I fling it
Acknowledge that I got it and you love it when I bring it
They say Illuminati and other ordeals
Is how my lawyer got me to avoid a raw deal
And now it's more real than it is for any other star
For how I deal with the path like Remy Ma
I get in the car like a sniper's on the roof now
But don't confuse how you see me have to move now
I got bars like the cypher's in the booth now
Long as they say my name right in the media
So I always match the picture in my ID
And what the crack era did to black men
It had to be a era if you had a Cadillac then
Put my arm around her like a bowl of chip with a dip
Peep the way this vibe conflict with they real lives
I dunno but it don't matter who choose to set it off
But through mixing chords and boards
And they don't seem able to outstretch they hands and admit they fans
Ostracize they memory for not remembering
The articles reduce their body parts to particles
And dust the Dead Sea with their cremated molecules
Speak of the legacy for short people around the world
Enjoy that breath like that one was your last one left
Spring is in the air and all the flowers are blooming
The powers that be wanna devour the movement
Tears disappear when they fall on the summer rain
Running across stages is a drug is like a blunt that we crumble in raw papers
It's war and we fighting for inches and millimeters
They try to stall the progress by killing off all the leaders
All these soldiers hate but I saw military training
The force flags fly at a half mast this morning
Turn the pool party into the one from McKinney
Now they wanna condemn me for my freedom of speech
Presidents get impeached and others fill in the throne
So maybe those projections out at Silicon
Are what drove her to get injections made of silicone
I swear it's the killing season
Whose juices fill the progress of this here very nation
Whose states has grown bitter through justice expiration
These fruitful trees are rooted in bloody soil and torment
Things haven't really changed or they're dormant for the moment
Helps us actualize the actual greatness held within
Seems like my only crime is having melanin
Connection to the sun so strong the relationship is lusted for
Neighbors would whoop that bad ass just for running through their lawn
Let's progress the story just a little bit
Never thought that I would be ever writing this song
Heart of a largest lion trapped inside the little dude
I hope my legendary style of rap lives on
My Jedi mind be moving me throughout the many dark streets
Closed mouths don't get fed or move ahead
I spun around without a care
I'm two heels from the top tier
Really want to be boss
Maybe the answer's not out there
Maybe it's on the ground somewhere
They wanna see my downfall
Turn a good day into a downpour
Thorns in the crown hit the cross I bear
I ain't even on my home field
And again I feel lost
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Po puts braces on my wrist like he was clapping his hands
Bring bro bro to me for the brotherly baptism
He'll make it out of the jungle some way
Submitting myself to praying these days
Caught between hope and despair
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me direction
Maybe we should get some guns too
She come around every now and a few
Living high ain't hard to do
She'll be in the clouds somewhere
Might even take your broad too
But stuck up in the same room
Too many open miles in here
Sick of eating out at drive through
Rather watch the Nixon shit than politicians politic
As if this country ain't already ruined
Sometimes it makes you trip out on your people
Sometimes it has connotations of evil
Some may hate it and some may overrate it
It's a top story and you rarely see a trend
She put you on the aces of all the stripper places
You beg her and you plead her and you tuck away your ego
She knows you need the chicken and you know that she's your people
It has you think your deceptive ways of being are the truest
Had the prettiest brown eyes but you change them shits to the bluest
Epithets that's racist is stupid and mean in nature
Something that can make you feel stronger when people hate ya
Ego make you violent or govern like a tyrant
This is the last Tribe and our ego hopes that you felt us
Fuck your ass cheek flows with bars sweeter than scones
No matter what the day
He could catch you on his plane or the one you on today
And make them scream of bloody murder
If you wanna take it further your Huckleberry is here
Papa had to levitate him
Give him his and don't debate him
Top dog is the way to rate him
We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate
But before we let the herd out the gate
Make sure the all the levels are straight out the jungle
De La Soul from the soul
Black medallions no gold
Buddy buddy buddy all in my face
Just in case the young girl likes to clap
Ain't for the wind but before I begin
I initiate the buddy with a slap
And when I quest for the buddy I don't fess
Let's stick out jimmy and see what we can catch
Next won't be needed unless
Buddy is the act that occurs on the lip
Boy let me get shot I won't even riff
Buddy buddy don't you know you make me go nutty
Not too skinny and not too chubby
Soft like silly putty
That was making me ever so horny
On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while
On the A side and sometimes the flip
Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree
And the pleaser to my man Plug 3
Behind my bush my buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ just knock it on out
Without Buddy I'd be on a roll
If you Quest from the Soul here's what we'll find
A whole lot of fun lots of fun together
If you be my buddy I will toast
You can be mines and I can be your buddy
The best buddy's in evening wear
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed
Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
And I watched and then I checked my swatch
The Soul had formed a buddy line
Is at the clubs our ritual unfolds
Yo fellas should we keep her aware
When I'm in motion it's just like the flow of the ocean
The weight of the words swerve and curve
My style flexes bigger than the state of Texas
I guess that makes me the top of the line
Oh yes I'm the most prime of all time
To knowledge the God on the groove
Too much for one mind to comprehend
First saw Big Daddy at the place called Union Square
If you went in by yourself it was a terror
Bring your bats and balls and please don't forfeit
Not in this sport of thought we block out the devil
Gotta make a mega migraine
All the braids in my neck symbolizes that I want room
That's on the radio it made me feel so low
And work it out all night that's what you came here for
I'll be damned if I let his song fall to the side
What you wanna swallow it down or let's take it
It's divine to hit the mind like slippery elms
All the beautiful things that a baller can go for
Soon lead to boredom and your feelings just may fade
Never be intrigued by the young boy face
Look inside me love you see I got wild taste
I don't really know but
Your style plus angle done up with finesse
Is rubbing you right and I hope you don't
Myself as tip so cut the other cats loose
Usually the reason why a lady wants me
Just listen to the mix to the mix...
While I sit in a range
Everything he says to you from now on
Just let your mind be free
A cracker jack joint to put on your ring finger
When you're all alone thoughts of us still linger
No other could be me because I shoot the g right
Massage your head up with a temple rub
It's deeper than the tangible I want in
On the dance floor never ever lie
The midnight marauder is the hype beat arranger
Make you catch a spirit and motivate a fanny
So if ya wanna do it to yourself
But now it's time to hit you with roughneck rudeness
Gel up my posse up on linden and 1-9-2
Don't ever try to step to a kid you can't get with
Mr. Incognito is back again
Jotting down my list of positives in life
The look on my girl is filled with conviction
Babble on the Boulevard to brother hood buddies
Poking in my pocket it's the E for the moneys
Brother man be wilding
While I be on mission that's beyond eye level
Magenta is the shade for the mystic parade
Chilling at the rest other brothers wreck it
When I woke Wednesday persons was grounding
Don't know the whereabouts can't be founding
Still on the smooth but a tidbit hyper
It's my thing what I bring I try to do it well
You can bet your bottom dollar that the Tribe will not be slipping
Making hit after hit as we commence to start ripping
The reason they can't find me is because they can't see me
It's like the war's going on in the middle of your mind
So you chill by yourself don't really sweat nobody
But lurking in the ghetto is a germ that insist
Should you back the germ away or utilize your fists
And rush away your pain with the power of the thought
Not checking for the fame although it's perpetual
I enter the world the same way I'll exit
Can't be timed with no swatch watch
Add an extra bar as I spar with literature
Winning more wars than the moors
Mathematics was the key to set my whole race free
To my own hustle bubble
To show the free bob right
While Satan rob light
John forte will keep you locked in
Some say it's fright night
The bell rings and now it's just a daily operation
Scribe check make connects
The man's got a God complex
But take the text and change the picture
Take orders from only god
Only war when it's jihad
But we the people dark but equal give love to such things
Once the pen hits the pad it's danger
To this I be no stranger
I'm hearing no comments
My man is still the greatest in this
We sing amazing grace over two dollar plate
Many lies put up for stakes
Wash our sins at the great lakes
You and I cannot see eye to eye
So therefore we cannot relate
I'm here when I make myself crystal clear
Tussle with a lasso in the royal rumble
Blow that make you feel like you was poison bitten
This be your last warning once you walk past the doorman
Ali and foreman gonna lock ass until the morning
We watched the rumble in the jungle
To see who be the targeted uncle to be the first to fall and fumble
When I bust your ass identify me as the lord victorious
Life situations are the one I speak about
We from the queen's county
And got no other choice except to get a little love
I only have the fear of guard and that's aqua
I got the lethal you couldn't put a match to it
Mind over matter action is needed
When the big one not to be super seeded
But on the kick rising in the past on in prompt to
My lily's hot like two links in the skillet
Now we should resort from the cradle to the grave
Don't make the scene messy
Some of my friends be like a people with stems
Folks be on the chase for this cheddar
But it can make you ass out
And when I'm at a show chicks never pass out
We got the noise to make the whole mash out
A tribe called quest make the party go down
Lyrics come to cats like a hot and cold flash
So can come with ease if four and a smash
Held the fort down like the justice league all the super friends
But in the world turn more spins
Brothers walk the street with the ill pace face
City life breeze contempt for each race
All pages due to a law and I should say it
Of every kind of drama
Cold like ice jazzed hot like a sauna
It's the has verse the the half guess who's arrived in the hood
Exposing all wrongs it's all good
Let's get a little bit before the whole joint expire
I got to stress it again
You see it's for my ken
To you we got to move through
Because we got to make it happen keep the true blue
But everything will be fine
Gotta make it alright
Gotta make it alright
Gotta elevate your mind
We are here to tell the world just who we are
So just come and peep the unique styles we are displaying
When you see me coming take ten steps back
I am the earner of the soul in mine
Forget the physical cause the physical will die with time
I'm shaped to vibrate in definite proportions
Ducks be bleeding from illegal feeding on my verb
I outwit vipers in my rhyme cipher
It's not the 187 when the 360 slept
You swallow the cake from the plate of elevate
Or you might get sparked by the crew who got the weight
Which guarantees to put me on the narrow road
Then I bet that it cut the chit chit
This is not a game and we ain't looking for the fame
So needless to say mad trails are left blazing
But I'm here to say real rhymes to pay
I'm the type of brother that writes until my knuckles get nary
Then transported to my throat then the quotes hit the air
As I stand dipped with the wares
Motivator of the many like Moses
Mine on the other hand is lent me tight
Real down to Earth I hit the Long Island Rail
You never see me tango with the horn and the tail
I got the kid for your mind I design it like sender
I gotta see what I got and who I'm getting it with
This ain't no nickel dime game that I'm peddling with
Packing hard like pistol but my pops got the crystal
Respects to Griff Dog for the razor
Much respects to Joe but for the favor
It's about a million brothers trying to make it in this world
Some veggie links and some fish that stinks
Smelled like she conjured up a mouse
Strictly collard greens and a occasional steak
Candied yams inside my tummy
Apple sauce and some nice red beets
I like lemons and limes
Gum drops and gummy bears tease my eyes
A sight for sore ones and some bore pies
And other goodies that are filled with goop
With fried apple roots
Pig in the pan or a pair of bogey chides
Pay attention to the Tribe as we impose
You know I look for trouble but trouble didn't follow me
Native tongues for believing in me when everyone was fessing
When you're face to face with your adversity
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually
When you're face to face with your adversity
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually
I know we're gonna make it
I know we're gonna make
And for the greatest amount
But make the ladies say ho
We must have unity and think of the bigger plan
My hair is crazy curly
Do what the hell I want and have no one to listen to
I'm prompt with my business and I do things on the double
I wanna say peace and dedicate this joint to MC trouble and to
This is for the slain rappers and the fallen rappers
You just gotta keep it happy and keep the vibes going
And this is vibes and stuff
To put the blame on something else rather than sometimes looking at
Complicated with the skills over reel to reel
Looking for a leader who can fill us up with either
Hitting us up with great emotional chat
Is constantly held back
Like 50 tracks back in a relay race
And the white team's ahead
So let's keep up the pace
And I be needing something
To feed my logical taste
Material gain we put too much in pursuing
Minus that shit in our body
What that got to do with that
Your physical presence
Embodies every lesson
Can't even life the knife to cut the mustard.
What we need to do first
Now listen to this verse
Let's concentrate on our spiritual plate.
Recognize your existence in this vast blue space
From a tiny cloud of blood
There's divinity within
Because we come from the divine
What we need to do is link it with persistence
From the spiritual world my former life has developed
Lost their mothers and their brothers
For them I feel empathy
I pour my heart out when I see dot out on the deck
But when it's somebody you know it hits you
And emotions get bruised
I won't judge you for knocking
Devil bomb my yesterday
My tomorrow he never gave back
Not cause you serving and I'm rapping I'm better
Just different pieces to the puzzle of black life
Cause families we gotta raise
No matter how long the money
Shorter become the days
Men become like women
And no difference in the season
If you got popped five times
You breathing for a reason
Let's put the five tenure plan into progression
Before we count our paper
Soon to be in your museum
You just a private in the lower class
I be the upper at your lawn
I'm sure to bust your shit like bolo
When your ass starts to cry it's redness
You can witness the style that I kick from the linguistics
It's the abstract with the new format
We do it like this and then we do it like that
Put my foot in your ass slow
Feel the force like a race horse or like a heard of buffalo
Freak the Spanish flow
Now bust the desperado
Mission impossible without expose
You complicate my dough
Handle situations pronto
Body full of bullets when they found him on the road
Pull a 9 on anything we spark
Let me get in those drawers
5-0 in the corner store
He heard all them claps with a round of applause
Spit at your back and you lie on the floor
Body full of bullets when they found him on the road
You talk to me dumb and that's how I react
One arm in the air like I'm waving a cab
Be ready to scrap when you talk to the Trap
You are now talking to a boss
Lou Bang still ride in the Porsche
She pop one pill no cough
When shit get real she spark
Get the head from the foreign broads
Body full of bullets when they found him on the road
Let these motherfuckers have it
Let them know we not playing this year
What I told your bitch dog
Dirty van bitches wanna suck my dick off
Run up in this shit raw
Front then he coming your way
Stank puss make my dick soft
Probably bumping R. Kelly sipping Cristal
So you know the whole world getting pissed on
I don't really give a fuck if you pissed off
Traded for my gold chain and my pistol
You stuck with a fat ho and she wanna stuff her face
With a little ting a ling ling school bell a ring
I was broke last week but today be a new day
Ty Beats in VA putting producers in graves
I ain't never had shit
Window to throw it out of
Sherm got me high get your ass in the shower
Start sucking dick bitch enough of the powder
Elijah Muhammad reside in my heart
Knowledge was born with science young lord
Study your scriptures and follow your God
Life in the trap I know times will get hard
I'll pick up your life just abide by the lord
You bout to get it from a general
I don't know if they can hear me though
Oh Lord once he's in the sight of the scope
Never taking no shorts we never taking no losses
Anybody with a bone to pick
I'm going to level my charge I'm damn sure to make it stick
Bone came original now they get me can you dig it
Hell yeah they can dig it while I'm sitting on my throne
Man I'm running till the end of this
I'm ready for the battle like a Pagan is
I'm never going to take it in and nobody can break it in
And a little bit of coke I put the cake in and it's certified dope
Having anything to do with it we selling
Like I'm peeking through the soul
They don't even really know
For the love of the money I gotta reap what I sow
But I keep it what I know
For the ending of the row gotta go will I go
My caliber lock and load alabaster box when I cock and I crow
To the clock and the time zone
Right now when they hydro while what about the well known Cairo
I'm on the grind full time never rest to get paid
Gotta get it how we go come meet me with the pros
If it ain't about dough then it ain't about jack
I get us in with a stack and then I get on attack
Call the reaper get the shovel I'm a certified rebel
In a league of my own
I never settle keep the pedal to the metal
But they couldn't get it quicker than the realest
Haven't I given them enough yet
Can't they understand they ain't dealing with a punk bitch
One quick move and it's murder
Pivotal giant of this shit
We'd like to thank the most high
Knowing that all things belong to those
For the cleanliness and the power the first in the nation
To prove who they are
With all things around me I will never win
I won't win with angels
I won't win with the brothers
I won't win with Rome
I won't win with Sodom and Egypt
Pull a chrome fifth when they murk them
Then murk off in Excursion
Big money shit we earning
A bunch of hooligans need churching
Gold teeth when I'm smirking
Lord know that I ain't really perfect
All of these clowns run around this circus
Lord please what is my purpose
Besides fucking these Persians
Popping these bottles and popping these models
Please tell me where is the Sherman
Now you praying in that trap when you hear that gun sound
You talking about you riding with them
Riding with a bunch of little trap villains
Getting all the bad bitches I been feeling
Hit her with the crack pipe get her lifted
Fuck your main broad till she on my friend's dick
Riding in a limo with a bunch of fake friends
I feel the pain for my bro cause his dad died
Rhythm and the blues in a white coupe
Spit it through a cloud with a nice boo
Like twisting up your fingers in a pair of mittens
Watch a frog leap were his fucking chin is
Bunch of young Trap Lords and we down for sinning
Crawling in them bitches like a caterpillar
I gotta close the window before I record
Keep your girl hit in my Tommy boxers
He shot me so I had to do it
Baby don't pray for me pray for the weak
They took the chain up off his neck
I heard the mac started running laps
I heard they had guns I didn't want to use that
I ain't want to see Tom in the fucking boo cap
What about Lil Mitt were the fuck he was at
But he got more heart then most of them cats
Lil young trap lord with a little backpack
They ain't want to do that
And another one squirt
Revenge is on my mind
And now they got my brother
Thinking about picking up my nine
And making them fuckers lick the blood up
No need for wasting time
You want to live the street life
Your wig get blown living that street life
You can't live long living this street life
Got to watch your moms in this street life
They'll come to your home in that street life
4 flip from the chrome in that street life
Your chromosomes all on that street life
Aim for the head ain't no need for a vest
Got thousands of shooters I pay just to flex
Now I'm beating that ass like Ike did Turner
In the neighborhood with all my neighbors hood
Give me you wanted the bitch ain't important
You do or die be all in your touring
Claim you the shit you get flushed in the toilet
Whole team on lean on Pisa sway
I'm ghetto and the pump got a critter all splattered
Have another hit but I want to hit the shatter
Dabbing all night really got me faded
Take a hit of my shit feel upgraded
Twist that shit like your weave got braided
Chilling in the palm trees feeling real shaded
Pass that shit like a deadly virus
Bitch give me long neck like an ostrich
Tell they friend give me jaws like a shark fin
I'll be Trap Lord Billy Bob Thornton
Better get the fuck out my face with all that
Or get a broken beat down with a baseball bat
I'm a thug with a baseball cap
Got a bad bitch slim waist from the back
Ass ain't fat but her face all that
Now how the fuck can a stranger miss you
Everybody going to this cocaine castle
You'll probably see your reverend at this cocaine castle
Pimps and prostitutes at this cocaine castle
Doctors in their suits at this cocaine castle
Babies in they pampers at this cocaine castle
Crying with they grandma at this cocaine castle
Momma doing drugs at this cocaine castle
Sing a song that be stuck all in your brain
I remember when I was lit the fuck up
I just... I just remember that day
Chills all over my body like some cold lotion
Looking for the cure but I'm seeing no potion
Seems like my whole life fucking been cursed
All I know is that fast Porsche smoking that good smoke
Liechtenstein when I drunk four you was dying in this war hall
Body left near the staircase courtesy of the whole mob
And I click like Donkey Kong when I hit this long
All I know is that fast Porsche smoking that good smoke
Put a meal on my plate
Put a meal on my plate
I won't stop till I die
And I won't stop till I die
Now I won't stop till I die
Because I got a natural high
And I won't stop till I die
Because I got natural high
A got a stack to the sky
I see my daddy say hi
He rolling dice with a Reverend
He said you used to be hot
I used to hang with them drug dealers
Bigger than two Roman pillars
Getting cake like Matilda
Put you in graves like the thriller
My team will give you the chillers
Put a meal on my plate
Put a meal on my plate
It don't matter if you spit it from off of the top
I be doing all the shit you probably can't
And the blue is how they keeping them up in the bank
I'm just a lyrical vampire
Who be hunting paper seven days of the week
All them music festivals and shit
Today was blazing so they taking off their shit slow
We divine and then shine through these dark demons
Now I'm straight off the stage into the tour bus
I couldn't figure what to write
Until I mumbled some words and started on the chorus
All of my life and all of my days
All of my life and all of my days
Plus I came out to Juicy and I fucked that Biggie flow
I'm getting rich so I gotta stop the stage dive
Especially when I'm done and the whole crowd stay live
All of my life and all of my days
All of my life and all of my days
Now my collect calls got your bills going ballistic
While I was in Carolina flipping birds in the kitchen
You heard that wasn't the only type of birds I was flipping
You knew something was up when I all of a sudden took two trips
Two trips turned into too many excuses
There's something about you
Baby we got to get lost in the moment
Like somebody coming to kill you and expect you to lay
Then blow kisses in the phone like that did something
But a good man is what you desire
I train a Jamaican girl that love the Cuban links
No limit soldier with a bunch of little tanks
Blood stain of what remains for two gold chains
Put my thumb in her butt like like I'm fucking bowling
Couple jolly ranchers when I'm pouring
Couple jolly ranchers
Couple jolly ranchers
Couple jolly ranchers
Couple jolly ranchers
Couple jolly ranchers
Couple jolly ranchers
Couple jolly ranchers
Couple jolly ranchers
Out in Trinidad with a bad ho
Out in Trinidad with a bad ho
Out in Trinidad with a bad ho
Out in Trinidad with a bad ho
But no boy can play me like a monopoly
Madame of the club have my two hip a swing
Give it to ya once I know you're gonna reminisce
Tell me if ya like this go ahead give it a kiss
Couple jolly ranchers
Couple jolly ranchers
Couple jolly ranchers
Couple jolly ranchers
Couple jolly ranchers
Couple jolly ranchers
Couple jolly ranchers

I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Had the chick looking like Mama love from the side
He couldn't do no wrong in my eyes
But at the same time I hated to see my mama cry
Ain't no wonder why I can't commit sometimes
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
His shoe was too small to fit my big toe in
Guess the money gave him new ways to ignore it
To see him kiss her ass made me nauseous
Then he'd give her sloppy hugs like my baby gorgeous
He was just doing that for the new forces
All this fucking bullshit that had my brain distorted
Ain't no wonder why I can't commit sometimes
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Didn't think Willie Lynch was that good at math
Now he lost in the field and it's so sad
Can't talk to a girl or know how to engage
He think being a gentleman is wrong and gay
And your uncle only had a girl when he got paid
All this shit put my life in a maze
Ain't no wonder why I can't commit sometimes
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
I got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face

Check out my walk because it is so amazing
Drop it low then pick it up before you hit the pavement
I was confined to crime since I was about 5 years old
I was followed like crazy this rapper life a pillow
Through puberty I was popping pussy and popping pimples
I almost fell I gotta pick it up
I almost fell I gotta pick it up
I got a story to tell let me let you know what's up
I was at Abyssinian playing basketball
But it was different from playing basketball at the park
That would make the fiends lean but they never fall
Almost crashed the car Mike
You almost crashed the car Mike
You almost crashed the car Mike
Yeah make this right fat boy
I spit that funky fuck yo mama all up in your face shit
This that pop a shot so it's big so you'll replay this
Just peep don't say shit
Loaded with shells I pop a shot and leave you with a face lift
Remove your body from the scene down to my mama's basement
Almost crashed the car Mike
You almost crashed the car Mike
You almost crashed the car Mike
And fuck your brother
If you like me in Russia any day
He wanted to take the bitch on a little date
Get that gun out of my face
Pretty bad bitch that's so yellow
Get it cracking on a bitch like a old leather
Used to go to Micky D's with no cheddar
Now let's go to Sue's Rendezvous
Most of your crew be strange dudes
Make it hot in here like Nelly
I'm young and perverted
I bet if you put my name on it that I make it bigger
And that's a damn shame
Don't want you to run away from me darling
This life can be so cold
Don't want you to run away from me honey
I want us to grow old
We talk about art then end up on sex
Not your average girl in spandex
I'm usually not that dude caught up in all these feelings
I've been around the world and dealt with all these women
Don't want you to run away from me darling
This life can be so cold
Don't want you to run away from me honey
I want us to grow old
Pearly white teeth like you live at the dentist
I don't know how to prevent it
Rinse it off like candy rain
Let nothing get in between what you feel
Don't want you to run away from me darling
This life can be so cold
Don't want you to run away from me honey
All I ever wanted was a Clams Casino beat
To talk about oppression
I mean we when I say Ferguson they talk about me
Shot down in Missouri
They keep us in misery
And get a desk job when the coroner leave
Hope that we live in bliss
And take a nap to create with the same brush that paint the past
We don't run it up for no help
All I ever wanted was a Clams Casino beat
All I ever wanted was a Clams Casino beat
Let's talk about hate
Then you run around town like you made my name
Just wanted to see and make some change
What about old friends that claim I change
All I needed was a Clams Casino beat
To talk about these loyal fans
All I needed was a Clams Casino beat
To talk about these loyal fans
Let's talk about fans
They happy when you make the deal
They build you up to make the kill
I love the fans who truly mine
Man art can be art sometimes
If I die before I wake
At least I lived life my way
Hope that you remember me
Please prepare me mentally
Now that you're no longer a lord that's trapped
You have graduated to the Hood Pope
You have made it to represent your people
Show them another way
Be the voice of the people who couldn't make it out the hood
They think I got me a house with a big couch and a gold sink
I'm no different what y'all are saying
You're not exempt from the growing chain
Slim model girls sniffing the coke
How you hood in a pope
I'll teach you how to build a grow tree
Life like a bike and pedal slow
Now you're the voice of the guys on the corners
Through the trials and the tribulations
Teach them the world can be accumulated with patience
If I die before I wake
At least I lived life my way
Hope that you remember me
Please prepare me mentally
Grandma used to call me Mickey Mouse but I'm no rat
Your uncle smell like shit like he got garbage in his ass
When my bitches come over they have the look of concerning
I seen him three three days straight sitting on a car
My mama barking like doggies
In front of my aunt and my shorty
But I think you're full of baloney
I ain't get no head from them shorties
Ain't be in the bed with them shorties
And please don't say these Magnums is for me
Better get your ass another plan if you want to blow
Can't play this corner for no more summers if you get my flow
You can be you tonight
I can see it in your face
And I know you wanna fly
I know you're rich in opportunities
I know you're rich in opportunities
My life vision was blurry
He don't care what you tell him
He got a hood bitch from the block in the winter
You can be you tonight
I can see it in your face
And I know you wanna fly
I know you're rich in opportunities
I know you're rich in opportunities
She used to sing like Tina Turner
I'll still whoop that ass with a switch and a splinter
Love how she dance like Michael Jackson
Told me I would be number one
You can be you tonight
I can see it in your face
And I know you wanna fly
I know you're rich in opportunities
Colonial Liquor was his odor
The fragrance of a rider soldier
I got an uncle and his name psycho
And he took both kids to the ghetto ass park
He used to have the braids with the cuts in his body
Grandma had the arthritis pain in her body
He was cut like Bruce Lee but he didn't know karate
I got an uncle and his name psycho
And he took both kids to the ghetto ass park
Where they be drinking forty ounces
With the brown paper bags for the ounces
No matter what day you found his ass at the park
When he got kicked out of his bitch crib
Always find his ass on the benches laying at the park
Just wanna get a couple of things off of my chest
Then put your camouflage vest on like I'm holding a tech
Then point it at the mirror like I'm holding your rep
With the rugged cornrows and a stab on my neck
Now like I was saying
Ya know we was just hungry like that
Grandma hid that hammer in her mattress from my uncle
Granddaddy tried to help him but he burnt out
They would dance and sweat they perm out
Cologne and liquor was his odor
40 ounce and then some marijuana
When grandma died from pneumonia
Sold him dope in by the bundles
Heat make the beef get grilled
Pistol under sheet when I sleep
Made another million this week
Swagger make a Bentley look cheap
Now you wanna talk about peace
If you got high off what I sold
Sad that the curb got closed
Leave him with a hole in his skull
Used to be sleeping on itchy beds
Tour life wasn't so well
My daddy died and my cousin too
They didn't let them out of no cell
Bought me some better bezels
Went and bought some new jewels
Dip and dab in this some new designer
We on the red carpet surrounded by pop stars trying to act tough
They say that we couldn't smoke in this bitch
And we fucked around and still rolled up
My grandma would be so proud
You didn't know what you know now
I gotta get in my zone now
I gotta get in my zone now
Teach Marty Baller how to be a boss
So none of us ever go broke now
I cannot bring you the boat now
My wardrobe is Tiffany Stones
I'm really putting on
That means I just caught me a new check
I got them new bezels
Don't keep the gun in the holster
Me and Pop fuck the same hoes
I might go bleach in that boo pack
I might go home but don't talk to me
Picture me in the club
Tip for the bottle girl
All the bottles around
So I stunt when I come around
Got a couple hundred off a swipe
Bought a Bentley off a swipe
Whenever I put it down
Whenever they come around
So I bought him a brand new Benz
Now he stunt when he come around
Got a couple hundred off a swipe
Bought a Bentley off a swipe
My goons all in that van
My shoes all in that van
My tools all from Afghan
Poppy seed residue on my hands
Sacrifice for my gang
I drop them bombs all in your barrack
I just grabbed a new Benz
Took them stocks off of that thing
I been rich a long time
Been rich a long time
That boy there still got the cocaine
Got a couple hundred off a swipe
Bought a Bentley off a swipe
Skeet is all up on her tooth
Why I go off in the booth
I keep that banger on me
Swipe and get all of my cheese
I bought my mom a new house
I bought my bitch a new dog
I brought my trap to the house
Bow when you talk to the lord
Couple rappers couldn't even get a table with us
Got a couple hundred off a swipe
Bought a Bentley off a swipe
Watch it rock while I'm spitting this crack
Lay him flat on his back
They ain't want to do that
She promised me a threesome with her best friend and I don't want to blow it
And your favorite rapper went zombie
Living for what we believe in is life itself
Beautiful people let's take a second and think
We continue these issues our ship will drown and we sink
This is nothing political this is so we be sync
Stick together forever and we'll weather the rain
Transform from arms and bombs like Vietnam
Teach your kid how to eat and teach your kid how to farm
Watch what you put in your body so you can live it long
This rap ain't no lap it's more like a marathon
This track ain't no track just something I set it on
Forgive to receive the blessing of peace and calm
Just a product of Malcolm X and Farrakhan
Martin Luther and Marvin Gaye came all to do a ghetto song
Beautiful people can be defined by
Beauty is behind the surface
It is the power of that beauty that holds us
It is the way we dance when we wanna cry
It is our mind that creates the definition of the beauty
Reach for the strength within
We are all beautiful people
I don't know when you're gonna understand that I've been here since day one.
My love for your music is bittersweet every time that I hear it
And pushes me away so I won't fall
My daddy and whole family hearing
About how you deceived and cheated with no caring
The honesty in music is fucking overbearing
I don't wanna hurt you and I hate to fight
I'm conscious of everything I recite
Clench the soul through fingertips when I write
I don't really know if it's wrong or right
I feel like God put me here to shed the light
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Through the pain and the tears
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Through the pain and the tears
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Through the pain and the tears
My open letter to my girl who got my back
Who's affected by the real shit in my raps
Ain't mean to hurt the heart of my beautiful girl
So I talk about how I shine and fuck on dimes
And you'll be crying in the dark and wanna leave sometime
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Through the pain and the tears
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Through the pain and the tears
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Through the pain and the tears
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Through the pain and the tears
Better get the fuck out my face
Bitch you better the fuck out my face
But I don't have half of what I want to achieve
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
I know that ain't true
And even though I want it all
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
I know that ain't true
And even though I want it all
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
Cause you know the haters watching and the bullets ain't cool
Don't wanna be compared to these rapper dude motherfuckers
But never get a crib up in Malibu motherfucker
And I don't want to wind up like him
I wanna pull up pull up in a 4-4 or Benz
You say you just need me and need no one else
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
I know that ain't true
And even though I want it all
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
I know that ain't true
And even though I want it all
And all the trust that you builds right out the door door
Y'all went from lovebirds to looking like Dodos
All the time like your ass still on parole though
Wondering if you just better off solo
Praying up to god about shit that's not even holy
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
I know that ain't true
And even though I want it all
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
I know that ain't true
And even though I want it all
We could fly to Puerto Rico and fight a mosquito
Or lounge out in Cuba even though it's illegal
I got the mean pipe but you supply me the drug
Blowing the color purple like Danny Glover and Silly
God took his time cause God damn you pretty
And I just really wanna hold ya
Girl it's you I'm ready to settle down with
And baby this a celebration to our love making tonight
Girl it's you I'm ready to settle down with
And baby this a celebration to our love making tonight
And every time that we fight
We just fuck and we make right back up
Girl it's you I'm ready to settle down with
And baby this a celebration to our love making tonight
Girl it's you I'm ready to settle down with
And baby this a celebration to our love making tonight
All I ever wanted was a minute with my grandma
But Rocky told me if them labels call just curve
When Rocky asked get money
Now we signed signed it
Wish you was here to smell this air
And I could touch your pretty hair
We could talk for two more years
Push you around in your wheel chair
Your birthday on Christmas
And we shed a tear like every year
You see she blew that candle near
What you don't know you shall feel
Grandma ain't gotta go through pain no more
Arthritis and pain and sores
Many nights you pray to God
Don't be slick you fucked that neighbor
What about time I fixed your table
All of them times filled your naval
But I know you and I love you
Fuck them other bitches sucker
I'm good and my kid love me
The only reason why I still really wanna breathe
Even though you love me unconditionally
And I understand the circumstance when it come to me
All I ever wanted was you here with me through all this shit
All I ever wanted was you here with me through all this shit
Through this life that I live through this life that God gave me
My synagogue right in the ghetto
But the pen game on a different level
One trap with a big dream
In this bitch like I'm Clark Kent
Got a deal with the devil like y'all say
Make a bill with these vocals
Embracing the drama that come with the fame
Ooh boy I don't wanna start
I'm kinda like Noah's Ark
I am leaving this Earth with a mark
I ain't got time for you marks
I aim at your head like a dart
He lay on the street with a chart
Spike on his head like he Bart
I wanna make a hundred million when I hit the scene
I wanna make a hundred million when I hit the scene
I wanna make a hundred million when I hit the scene
Rubber band man got the pocket with the bankroll
Rubber band man got the pockets with the bankroll
I just brought a Rollie and my bitches broke the bezel
Rubber band man got the pocket with the bankroll
Rubber band man got the pockets with the bankroll
Thought we was inconspicuous
Rubber band man got the pocket with the bankroll
Rubber band man got the pockets with the bankroll
Jewish lawyer got my case
I was in the rental with a seven
I know the trap and I know survival
I already killed your main bitch
I blew a check on the fit
Look at my neck and my wrist
I wanted a million before I hit thirty
So now I can flex in the whip
I got respect off the rip
This Sprite got a medicine twist
It ain't hard to tell that we rich
Used to say I dressed so strange
Already put mama in the house
In the back of the Marc Buchanan
Wore Gucci with the Vans then
Used to Harlem Shake with the big shirts
Rich but I still love me a hood Dominican bitch with a Corona
I'm a Trap Lord again
This what it sound like when doves cry
Fucking on a bad model bitch
Damn and I never had a bitch pop a pussy like this
That's a bad bitch right there
Look like I had it in refrigerator
Had your bitch put a good kiss on a dick
And she know that's my my spot right there
Bad Australian bitches in designer jeans
Drop the top on that new zoom zoom
Collar Gang and that's when the drama come
Went from papers to smoking by the jar
Just happy walking on some people on the run
Shouldn't have a clean record with the shit I've done
She spend mad time with the kid
Rainbow shot my wrist
Adidas done gave me the check
Come and just fuck with the set
They be protecting your neck
Ice bucket challenge with Dex
Rainbow shot my wrist
Call me Coach Cartier
Call me Coach Cartier
Rainbow shot my wrist
Call me Coach Cartier

You know I don't care what she tell them
Just brought that shit and my bitch broke it
But her pussy wet like the ocean
I'm fucking her friend and she know it
My jewelry stone cold like Steve Austin
Even though that beef old I don't care
I will not fuck with the Raiders
Second deal out with Adidas
Making a bitch sing like Aretha
I'm fucking your bitch when you eat her
You cuffing that bitch like you need her
Rest in peace until I see ya
Boy I'm stealing your hoe
Taking your hoe to the pad
She wanna suck on the dick
I can't pull up bitch I'm booked
Walked in that bitch and the bitches they looked
Check in with me and do your job
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Suicidal doors brought to me with no advisory
I fuck yo bitch for the irony
Check in with me and do your job
Check in with me and do your job
Rappers talk subliminal but they don't talk to me
Check in with me and do your job
Check in with me and do your job
Tonight I fell in love with a stripper
Ferguson can be her last name
Tonight I fell in love with a stripper
Ferguson can be her last name
Came along way from the mattress
And I used to hump on the mattress
My grandma kept the gun in the mattress
My uncle kept O's in the mattress
Psycho gun in the mattress
Grandma pass it and he blast it
She made it disappear like magic
Bed bugs cooked in the mattress
Came along way from the mattress
Used to lay on a rug like Aladdin
Trap Lord meaner than the mug
Don't ever let it get fucked up
Came along way from the mattress
And I used to hump on the mattress
My grandma kept the gun in the mattress
My uncle kept O's in the mattress
Did mad shit on the mattress
Two ratchet fat chicks on the mattress
Roll mad rounds on the mattress
Fuck mad times on the mattress
King size bed full of ashes
She smoke on my dick and don't pass it

And I used to hump on the mattress
My grandma kept the gun in the mattress
My uncle kept O's in the mattress
I'm a one night savage
Baby wanna top me so I put her on the mattress
Told you that I want it so I had to make it happen
This that East Coast motherfucker
Call me Mr. East Coast motherfucker
Y'all already know the god gotta talk
Every second bitch I gotta use it
Grab the microphone and not make a motherfucker lose it
When I finish with it then we go in the back of the club
Somebody better call the cops yo
10031 is where my zip is
Run through a bodega like I ain't got riches
On Hungry Ham up on the corner
For being in the streets to run a culture
In New York I Milly Rock to Magnolia
My flow still monumental
I find these college chicks for top with Kylie's lips
Hit up Remy for the pretty gang
I'm more Ali than Muhammad
Bitch I don't play for no Mavericks
But I'm still conscious enough to give hope to the masses
Watch the coke do gymnastics
Son of a gun with the Buffalo
Get the money slide like a violin
This that East Coast motherfucker
See I'm from Long Beach
See I'm from Long Beach
See I'm from Long Beach
This that East Coast motherfucker
Call me Mr. East Coast motherfucker
Nowadays shit is crazy out here man
Hundred bottles in the club when I land though
Now look what I did to you
Used to only hear ice cream trucks now all we hear is sirens
Make a dollar out of these words
So I try to find an angle
Yeah I try to find another angle
I try to find another angle
So I try to find another angle
So we can tango with these words
So we can tango with these words
Ain't nothing like real life events
Just found out my daddy died for the wrong reasons
Now it's gold grills glisten every time the teeth in
I swear my whole life changed last weekend
She say that I remind her of her son
The one you clean dishes with
Dance all around these words
If I don't speak it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango
The only option is put it in the verse
Express it to my fans so they be alert
Fake hugs and love every time when they see you
I got the heart of a lion and the eye of a eagle
Dance all around these words
If I don't speak it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango
Dance all around this words
Dance all around this words
Stay fired up like arson
You can't touch my garments
Up late nights pass Carson
I be at the ball hanging no grip
My security bullets like 4 inches
Kick that shit like four ninjas
Made it out the hood to the good side
You heard it through the grapevine
And I was actually there
Bossed up in this bitch
Got my golds up in this bitch
Don't get tossed up in this bitch
Four trill bitches on my Rollie
Make a girl wanna cuff like the police
Me and Rocky like Apollo Creed
Just collect cash while designing sneaks
Whip yo teeth every time I speak
Funds up get you some
And yeah that loud ass tree
Yeah I get a lot of checks and yeah I have a lot of sex
And labels know I got up next
Yeah she knows she got the best
I got her wet she got undressed
I nutted all across her chest
And now she went and got obsessed
Y'all are just the hottest mess
You're simple you are not complex
I'm sorry I am not impressed
Back on my bullshit again
I am having way too much fun
I'm in a section with 7 Kate Mosses around me
I swear I can't only touch one
I gave her something to rub on her gum and her face just went numb
And yeah that loud ass tree
Heard you got some new shit coming
Maybe I could be the biggest
I'm in a section with models
When that bottle pours I just keep drinking it straight
And get faded and pass out on floors
And yeah that loud ass tree
Probably licking your honey like Winnie the Pooh
Knock you on the ground then I'm lifting my boot
Better learn your algebra and your decimals too
Your bitch on my dick and her lesbian boo
All up on my dick head Danny
And I'm always seeing doubles so my bitches come in pairs
All my white girls sniffing Britney
They never used to notice now they digging me
Fuck boy talking out of turn
My brothers leave you sleeping in an urn
A couple more commas richer
That's why they don't like us rolling deep to the club
My trunk shake and my pink spill
Chrome lady with the grain wheel
A couple bad bitches every day chill
And it's snakes in the grass but the bitch ain't cut
More fashionable with a bad bitch or two
Learn my tricks from the dope game
Blow in her nose got crack on the stove
They say it costs to be the boss
Sipping that Persian wine
All of these bitches is on me
Talk to me nice or don't talk to me at all
Coming through with the fucking gun or the knife
Hit me with a half bring it back in two days
Living in Cali by the oceans
I'm over here fucking no loving
Coke and white bitches
Just coke and white bitches
Coke and white bitches
Just coke and white bitches
Coke and white bitches
Just coke and white bitches
And a cracker ho that give me what I ask for
Juice be the blue flame that create the whole thing
Saving every penny trying to get up out this hellhole
Three fly ass bitches with we
Addie in the Caddy with the heat on cock
My name is that pretty motherfucker
And I rep that Harlem
Look upon his little child
Allow me to come to thee
Lord Jesus forgive me for my sins
All gold slugs and I don't need to floss
Gold link chain swing down to my balls
I make it to heaven you'll be by my side again
All they know struggle pain all of their life
Washing down pain with that purple and Sprite
I get on that and ride it like a Huffy ho
I get on that and ride it like a Huffy ho
I get on that and ride it like a Huffy ho
I get on that and ride it like a Huffy ho
And fuck you to them haters who love they job and never take days off
I get on that and ride it like a Huffy ho
Looking for talents just like I'm a college scout
Money hulking like Bruce Banner
In my yard facing blunts while I feed my pups bath salts
All they know is suck and fuck and speak a different language
Plans to get richer or kill them with the scriptures
See me singing and winning
Y'all ain't getting dividends
Man I got racks to get
Man I got racks to spend
I'm fit on some rapper shit
It's so easy to fall in love
All these magazines try to play me out
It's so easy to fall in love
Call her to come over and you just try to control her
I did it again for my culture
I'm slipping from feeling this sober
Undress and I sex and I hold her
Caressing her breast with my head on her chest I'm all on her
Fill the white hoes in my Phantom Rolls
Parking lot pimping got them hoes with me
Parking lot pimping got them hoes with me
I'm in the state of mine like a dinner date's fine
We can go to the condo and drink wine
She wanna to be my girl but it'll take time
First dim the lights close the drape blinds
Don't spur show fur big grill gleaming
Polar no firm when the ship season
I fuck a hundred bitches to these day we still speaking
I had them dark tints it's hard for them to see in
But they get confused with my thought patterns
You fools don't know when I roll up on you I will have to spray ya
Sipping and tipping and drinking real slow
Hitting and splitting and cracking your dome
You fools don't know when I roll up on you I will have to spray ya
Matching in the million dollar mansion with brans
My uncle Snoop told me keep the biscuit on me
Said they got the scoop on me and they listen on me
And the nosy bitch next door call the district on me
King of New York in my hood we blow up houses
Grenades look like quarter waters sitting on the counter
December 21st coming straight for that ass
Mr. Orange leave your dog drowning in the reservoir
You could never get the best of us
6 inch blacks in my Tee by Marino
Getting higher than that plane shorty tell me what you think
While he with his bitch like Cam at the brake light
I'm only 19 but my mind is older
When this shit get for real my warm heart turn cold
Just to think this come from what I speak
Sitting on a couple P's this rap shit was the other door
And I'm blowing on that potent whipping in the seven like it's stolen
And I'm riding east side till the spokes break
Leave the studio for a motherfucking smoke break
Get your main ho to come through for a throat break
While he with his bitch like Cam at the brake light
Laying on who sleep in the earth
I'm in the hell yeah that bitch made a beast of me
Middle finger up to the bitch who would fuck shit
Medusa faces turn me into stone
One straight to that dome
Talk to me nice or don't talk to me at all
Teflon vest for those who test
And the llamas on deck
Just in case you ain't heard what I say
And the llamas on deck
Just in case you ain't heard what I say
And the llamas on deck
Just in case you ain't heard what I say
And the llamas on deck
Just in case you ain't heard what I say
And the llamas on deck
Just in case you ain't heard what I say
And the llamas on deck
Just in case you ain't heard what I say
And the llamas on deck
Just in case you ain't heard what I say
And the llamas on deck
I love how she think she graduated with that brain
Dibble dabble with the lean
Banana clip with the scope
My Jewelry glistening why I'm always chilly
With a bad bitch in the Bentley
Wood grain with the roof gone
Make a bitch fold like a futon
Tell me what the fuck is you on
Damn I got the smoke right
Let you get the floor seats
I got a lot on my head
Gucci rag tied on my head
Put a red dot on your head
Don't be talking to me crazy
Don't be talking to me crazy
Don't be talking to me crazy
Don't be talking to me crazy
I got a lot on my mind
I got a lot on my mind
I put that nine to your mind
I don't want no conversation
I don't need explanation
Shoot with no hesitation
They do it for a reputation
They don't play me on the station
Man I'm Rocky like a caveman
Try to cuff me like a cop car
That's how you get not far
Might just drop in on a Wednesday
I got nines on my waist
I got a lot on my head
Gucci rag tied on my head
Put a red dot on your head
Don't be talking to me crazy
Don't be talking to me crazy
Don't be talking to me crazy
Don't be talking to me crazy
I got a lot on my mind
I got a lot on my mind
I put that nine to your mind
Hundred thousand dollar nightmare
If I wanna take a flight there
Man fuck it spend a life here
Walk around with a bag on me
Walk around with a flag on me
I got a lot on my head
Gucci rag tied on my head
Put a red dot on your head
Don't be talking to me crazy
Don't be talking to me crazy
Don't be talking to me crazy
Don't be talking to me crazy
I got a lot on my mind
I got a lot on my mind
I put that nine to your mind
It ain't hard to tell what the fuck I'm on
Bad bitches only thing into my arms
Floating as you rolling
Smoking on this potent
Baby say she want a line
I gave her purple potion
Stroke it till the morning
Clique up with my bros
Sniffing lines off my dick
Got a bitch who stash my weed and got another one to roll
It ain't hard to tell what the fuck I'm on
In the summer time my fly glow
Bitches on the guest list at my shows
Day dream of getting that Phantom Rolls
Run up on me meet the 44
Mobbing ten deep in the Tahoe
City on my back like a campaign
Pull up on your block like a goblin
Then the police get to chalking
On the West got the drank for the low low
Like you came from the twelfth floor
Where it's at matter fact who the hell knows
It's a fact that I rap and I move O's
Then I'm trapped in a trap turn the two door
Man I'm one then I'm done then it's new coach
These cops play different
Every corner got a camera
I swear the game got a cancer
With bitch made tendencies
Ain't about gang bangers or color bandannas
See Willie still Lynching they want us to hang us
Game is still pimping adapted the changes
See that's what I did and momma I made it
But I'm gone out my mind and my point is vacated
Addicted to money and driving new Ranges
I want to be clean but the water is so tainted
That bitch's breath stinks and you know her pussy stinks
Say what now he wasn't ready
That bitch house smell like piss I heard
Let's go fuck with the hoes
Slamming rappers like a sumo
And fuck your vest my gun shoots through those
But keep it cool though
But you know the Mob major
The whole style made up
I tell you straight up
I'm hardcore go get your weight up
I pimp the hoes like my name's Goldie
Yeah your freak know me
Leave that thing swollen
Cruise through my city with my hammer loaded
The pigs annoying like the sound of locusts
Our lives are like a roller coaster
We delete stack chips and keep the heat for vultures
Honeys on my mind every fucking day
All that I wanted man
Wanted some money man
Look at my wallet man
Call me the money man
She do the money dance
Cash rules everything around me

When you see how I flex
See the pain in my eyes
For my blood all the time
It will be Halloween on the 4th
Spilling mad weed on the floor
So I'm thinking about taking this shit to the next level
You gotta see the vision you know what I'm saying
Motherfuckers getting in all types of shit out there
I've never been to Europe
I don't like saying my shit more than two times
Got this bitch all in my face yeah
Fuck her then cum on her face now
Spend a whole check on my waist yeah
Trust a soul that's okay yeah
Stoned all in London town
On the corner everyday when you see him posted
Toasted with the soldiers
Avocado seeds up on my broccoli
All of my hoes are foreign man
Know how I love them bitches though
All of my hoes are foreign man
All of my hoes be switching hoes
In the Rolls with my mens now
Somebody show my opponents

That shit turned me to a junkie
She sucked my dick and that ho got a donkey
Put your ass right in the coffin
Diamonds so heavy on teeth

Turned that bitch straight to a runner

Bitches on me like a bachelor
We live our life like a bachelor
Diamonds on me like a bachelor
Phantom on me like a bachelor
Bitches on me like a bachelor
I keep that work for the low
22 shots to his brain if he stain on my name
Fuck around and iced up my neck
Do what I need for respect
Hop in a whip and cut school
I'm getting head like a uppercut
They don't want war they not tough enough
I need that shit it not out yet
I wanna foreign my outfit
Thumbing and dabbing I run it up
I got yo bitch in my spot again
Regular bitches play hard to get
I done somethings that you wouldn't dare
I need that Raf and that Gucci too
I should pop Pamela Anderson
Calling her pussy an ambulance
Let me record like the camera man
And I don't know how to act
Harlem back up on the map
True New York will knock the Apple out you Jacks
Who order a piece before they hit the floors
Not even shit you see overseas in stores
Greedy for the fat guy's platter
Mix the pour up with the Pepsi Cola
Made about like 30 thousand
Attendance this year was like 30 thousand
Crib got a tennis court
Get my Venus and Serena on
Ambulance come when I hit the scene
That boy flier than a bag of bees
Boy this weather ain't got a thing on me
I used to serve it for your man's
You tricked off and everything
You thought you was the man
Sunday school legends
Your ass got some John Legend
Out in Paris like I'm Perry Ellis
Parallel park the 911
United Kingdom with the French connection
And put you in a coffin
Like she from Baton Rouge
After school made some revenue
Make ya choose up on ya man
I got such a rocky wrist
Lil bitch shut the fuck up and you can have you some hundreds
And you know I gotta cross the finish line
Two best friends at the same time
Two best friends at the same time
I find it funny how she blow time
When she come around ... and I fuck around
And you know I gotta cross the finish line
I know what's it's worth
Diamonds dance like Carlton
And you know I gotta cross the finish line
Got all these O's in my bank account
All black it's going ham gang fly they swiping shit
And I licked and I flew right to LA
Switching lanes with the gang do it all day
You could tell I run the business
Y'all just started what we finish
Like black American Express
All black when I dress
We can touch the water
We can touch the water
Fade on me like a pussy
My girl she look like a stripper
Put diamonds on my sister
Filled up off the lobster
I got her running away
Come up off that pussy
Make some money today
Leave your man at home
Take you round the world
We can touch the water
We can touch the water
We can touch the water
Nasty in this hoe man
I might fuck around and
You know how the game go
Fuck yo bitch one night
Told her if she fuck me right
She could get what she wanted
I just call up my accountant
Walking on it like Jesus
Hundred racks froze in water
I plug that in the freezer
Jump with the Mac in the back of the Jeep
Cadillac diamond the back of that old school
When I'm with my team
Don't wanna fuck with the team
She wanna fuck with a king
Hood Pope doing his thing
She wanna ride with the team
Taking the bitch of your dreams
Now that bitch my little queen
We can touch the water
We can touch the water
We can touch the water
We can touch the water
This new sensation won't feel the same again
Playing with the money like the game Atari
When I pull up it's a car show
Big bank like Wells Fargo
This new sensation won't feel the same again
I just wanna be your friend
Now she wanna pull up in a Phantom
Ever since she don't gotta stress
Buy her anything she need
Fly her out to Germany
Your main bitch said I look gorgeous
Brand new Porsche came with some horses
Sipping that purple like Prince
She get that three like a swish
I need me some guidance
Come out the projects
Fresh out the Porsche
Best from the west to the north
And you know Gucci my shoes
Don't front you get hit
I can sense something different in the air
It's like a weight being lifted
And you in your feelings
And making poor decisions
Music for the children
Major even independent
Keep him out the prison
Writing freedom with the pen and pencil
MTV about a Interstitial
Fuck with me because it's beneficial
Unsuspected like an incidental
They breaking my hoes in half
Come on through stunting too
Looking in the mirror
Vision getting clearer
She ain't fucking then she gotta go
Best believe I get it by the boat
Car so big she wanna get up in it
Tell the bitch to chill but she still catching feelings
Popping that molly prescription
I just go hard in the kitchen
Told her go mind her own business
Diamonds getting chilly
Combat boots on me like Major Payne
I done fucked multiple mamas
I done count multiple commas
We brought in multiple llamas
Ain't never been to Bahamas
I done fucked multiple mamas
I done count multiple commas
We brought in multiple llamas
I stay with that Uzi like Drama
I stay with the Uzi for drama
I stay in the cut with piranhas
I hit multiple drops of Cassandra
We having sex in the sauna
Get you some money and run it up
Smoking a blunt when I nut in her... face
Can't play in my garden
I ain't never been to Bahamas
Met with your favorite designer
Gucci show with Alessandro
Your sis give me head on recliners
Your wife wanna throw me vagina
Got syrup like Aunt Jemima
Get to the bread like a bakery
Paper plate or fine china
Eat at delis or in diners
Couldn't pick me out of a line up
Look at the digital dash
Just trying to live a bit
Ain't never been to Bahamas
But my chain's so lavish
While they're counting my karats
You cannot come in my zone
White model bitch with ass
Half a million in the Porsche
Got a chopper on the porch
Palms trees and recliners
Third strike in the bush
Couple grand on the front
Fell in love in the gut
Your career in a trunk
Whole aisle full of duds
Album cover for the buzz
I never been to Bahamas
I used to catch licks in pajamas
Super soaker then dive in the pool now
I ain't never been to Bahamas
I ain't never broken a promise
I'm on the coast with a goddess
I'm on a boat to the tropics
Bitches not fucking not coming

All the hoes that you call are not coming
All of the bitches I fuck are not common
If I'm in the room please don't come I beat the pussy like it need production
All she want from me is reproduction
Got like three concussions
They copy copy like 10-4
All your jewelry like tin foil
Bitches not fucking not coming
Bitches not fucking not coming
Bitches not fucking not coming
Bitches not fucking not coming

Bitches not fucking not coming
Pull up and we drumming

First Year Being Rich
I'm bout to cop a house on Riverside
I'm losing count it's hard to memorize
Oh while I be worth my mind and my prophecy
Came with a bank and monopoly
Just bought estate in the colony
Mob with the infantry
The first time being rich
Not the first time seeing shit
Illegitimate at hitting licks
Gold neck full of hidden gems
A half a billion by 36
Done been had lint in my pocket
Now I'm plugged like a socket
Bankrolls in my pocket
Had to learn both grind and patience
Took my moms on a trip to Jamaica
Stressed out my head was aching
This my first year being rich
This my first year being rich
She want to ride with the man
She wanna rock with the gang
To none of you rappers are actors
Meet me at the hotel lobby
To all the reactions of fame
Too many fans to fit in the crowd
I'm way too advanced to figure him out
The bar's too high to give it a raise
To none of you rappers are actors
Eat that pussy like hibachi
And it feels so good when it's new
Finger froze like Liberace
And it feels so good when it's new
To none of you rappers are actors
Arcade in my kitchen TVs in my lobby
Cozy boy be flexing I ain't never resting
Always at my leisure crib got special features
Everywhere a station everywhere a speaker
Tree house on the roof I gotta take a breather
I'm the coziest staying Gucci down to the socks
I swear that bitch stay in the mix
What happen when you gotta bigger miss
That Mr. Dick is a hit or miss
Ride it like it's stolen
Coming at you all incorrect
I ain't with that talk shit
What happen when I gotta get the check
I dip to flex and step on your ribs and neck
What happen when you gotta pipe it up
What happen when you going 730
Now I'm on this no phone call
That's what happen when you nutted in a hoe
Get dealt with the squad
This what happen when you unified
Get knocked out on camera
Might invest into some Raf shares
Rick Owens be the tag
Alessandro Gucci glasses
Diamonds on my neck and Rollie on
Now Atlanta got all different flavors
I got all of this flick for the Lord's worship
This bitch too rare to bust
Parka pockets full of mint leave
Backwoods all forestry
I'm cold like I'm sick with the flu
I cover my face and I'm bloody
I need some time alone
Got too many less than impressive rappers left in my path
Still a lethal weapon but try and bless him with math
And I just bought that chopper and that pistol with the scope
All these diamonds in my teeth
And I gave her the beast like I'm Timothy
Moonwalk in that pussy like Billie Jean
And I open your chest like you Janet Jackson
I put him in a lake and I penetrate
Let it sit in your face like a dinner date
With a crew of gorillas like 50 Cent
And I'm only gone ride with my syndicate
Father please forgive us
I don't need to seek attention
She talk to my dick like an intercom
Then smoke that dick up just like it's a bong
I know that it's wrong so the boy pray
So she don't take me to Maury
Man I done lost me a classy bitch
Father please forgive us
I don't need to seek attention
Father please forgive us
I don't need to seek attention
Don't cry dry your eyes call me a jerk
I know this relationship is never gonna work
But I plant thoughts in your head that only do ya dirt
And I said this once before we make the perfect team
It doesn't really matter to me
And as sad as it seems it doesn't really matter to me
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see in my dreams
And as sad as it seems it doesn't really matter to me
Now you can cry me a river or cry me a ocean
Maybe the Pacific that's just to be specific
Dip dip next ho they be on my dick like
All on my testicles I can't even piss right
After we fuck you won't see me again after this night
And as sad as it seems it doesn't really matter to me
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see in my dreams
And as sad as it seems it doesn't really matter to me
Don't cry dry your eyes call me a jerk
I know this relationship is never gonna work
But I plant thoughts in your head that only do ya dirt
And I said this once before we make the perfect team
It doesn't really matter to me
Now you can go go where you want front who the one gotta get that vibe
Live try dis surprised but she just say I'm on her eyes
Now I be the man peter man I fly high cause you like my drift
Get her girlfriend in this whirlwind how we spin
And as sad as it seems it doesn't really matter to me
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see in my dreams
My bittersweet symphony
Damn landlord keep bitching cause you owe her
I'm too afraid to grow up
I'm pray to god I blow up
And roll up in something foreign where the front doors go up
Could hear my prayers
When my back against the wall
I'll swallow my pride
These wolves got me scarred
Guess just to prosper gotta strive
Everybody know my name
And they doing the same
And the haters gonna hate
I'm just doing my thing
And I'm blowing up fast
Now we doing deals with the major businesses
Shit if money didn't change you
You ain't getting enough
And I be mobbing to mars
Y'all ain't telling me shit
Y'all ain't help me with shit
Ooh money change drastic
Flew through gymnastic
And the roof do a back flip
Zooming through traffic
Probably with a bad bitch
All of that was past tense
Now I'm living lavish
If I should die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take
As I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord I rest in peace
If I die before I wake
Please enjoy the songs I make
As I lay me down to sleep
This is for my bitches getting high on the regular
Something for you to try now
I know you feel alone but I'm gonna get you high now
Got her open now she hoping we get high
I got her sipping now she tripping
She say that my pipe is crack and you know I'm gonna get very ill
So I just penetrate and hit her with my needle
Keep my crack in between her thighs
Get it how live it when you know you need the hook up
Swag so sick where the birds caught the flu at
Them might be the product of the locker
Tool on the waist just in case I gotta fix em
Bullets like fiends just dying to hit them
I'm a uptown blood slime
I'm from the home of the free S
I'm Grade on the West like I'm Gucci on the ES
Still got my sleeves rolled up and my shirt tucked
Sipping on that syrup
And a quarter key will turn a G into a gent
Drop crotch pants will remind you of them Hammer clothes
No way I could afford it so for now I'm just pretending
Cause my pockets full of lint and my heart is full of vision
I don't do kid stuff much
I don't hear y'all much
Curtains drawn and six dudes back
The chauffeur ride in the front as we speed to the dot
Deanna waits along with the classy mist
My waist my shoulder blades the type you can't resist
Amen for the new saviors of rap
Passport is stamped from sightseeing the map
More like a lifestyle in the rawest form
Don't cry dry your eyes call me a jerk
I know this relationship is never gonna work
But I plant thoughts in your head that only do ya dirt
And I said this once before we make the perfect team
It doesn't really matter to me
And as sad as it seems it doesn't really matter to me
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see in my dreams
And as sad as it seems it doesn't really matter to me
Now you can cry me a river or cry me a ocean
Maybe the Pacific that's just to be specific
Dip dip next ho they be on my dick like
All on my testicles I can't even piss right
After we fuck you won't see me again after this night
And as sad as it seems it doesn't really matter to me
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see in my dreams
And as sad as it seems it doesn't really matter to me
Don't cry dry your eyes call me a jerk
I know this relationship is never gonna work
But I plant thoughts in your head that only do ya dirt
And I said this once before we make the perfect team
It doesn't really matter to me
Now you can go go where you want front who the one gotta get that vibe
Live try dis surprised but she just say I'm on her eyes
Now I be the man peter man I fly high cause you like my drift
Get her girlfriend in this whirlwind how we spin
And as sad as it seems it doesn't really matter to me
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see in my dreams
I imported stone cold drugs
Show you how to do this
My all gold grills give her cold chills
Fold it then bag it then move to the trash
We smoking then thinking then burning that hash
Never disrespected plus I'm well connected
Swagger so impressive and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7
Got a new Cadillac with a diamond in the back
Got a bitch and she bad with about a hundred tats
Everybody know we got the shit and baggages to match
On the set and they like the nicotine to cigarette
Different things made a change of plans well that all depends
Only thing bigger than my ego is my mirror
Clothes getting weirder
The nerves with this dude but I'm cool as a vent
Brand new me meet the brand new guys
That 45 be the big toy
Clipped up like I'm paranoid
Pull it off through the city like
You wouldn't be the first covering the dirt
Backpack full of random work
With two bad hoes I'll teach you how to jerk
Teach you how to jerk
Pop me a pill and throw that pussy a rave
Nappy chin hairs with the brand new fade
Killer charisma these cupcakes remember
My objective is to serve your agenda
Balls in my hands and your bitch in my house
Do all that shit you be talking about
Like we really be fucking
Brand new me meet the brand new guys
Brand new shirt to the brand new drawls
This motherfucker hold 15
Riding round with that mask on
Like a Mac attack when that strap on
Blue pit in my back yard
Red nose my bad broad
Tight and full of that hydro
Big bird and your big mouth
I pull it up then skirt off
40 oz of that Cristal
No horseplay when we quick draw
Me and my twin at it again with this flow
Spit it and flip it like Bone
Career dying quicker than a cold fish
A hater don't faze a gangster
Hoes get caught in amazement
I get so high I touch the sky till I can't even function
I get so high I fuck around and wanna leave the function
In the back seat full of bitches
Them bad bitches blow kisses by my earlobe
Going broke is not an option always on that cash flow
She used to call me asshole now she drop that ass low
Fuck it man I'm past dope sour diesel stash tho asap we the last hope fuck it this my fast flow
That's swag bitch you mad bitch see you in my past bitch
I'm on my job man I see you when the suns up
Asap to the top and these bitches love everything
Yo bitch I'm in bed wit her
Go yo nasty flow that's a little bit of crack mixed in with a fifth of hen
Great adventure shit roller coaster take a flick of this
Motion picture shit bitch I grind like a skater do
Working never chilling till I get a million
Cause these other rappers lame and don't care to do the same
Like a motherfucking G told me
Do we have a problem in here
All I do is sit back and think with a 40 beer
And you gotta feel the funk
She's all that I want
This the kinda pain I just couldn't take away
Something like Wayne cause you couldn't feel your face
Styrofoam cups with jolly ranchers at the bottom
Telling me she wanna bone but I ain't got no condoms on me
She claiming I'm a Pimp C
She sip it till it's empty
Moving like it's turtle time feeling like the world is my mine
Flying through the purple sky
And I'm in a different world and you kinda look like Jasmine guy
You can smoke that weed
Break it break it down break it down so I can beat it up
This is for my old head go on turn your speakers up
I met with my old head we sat for a while
I said I'm just on my grind I come to Houston all the time
When the chips is down and the jig is up
And move my mother nice somewhere closer than a town house
I spoke with my old head and this is what I found out
Life is just a bitch a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money money come and goes
Friends turn to foes foes they be fake
When pop homeboy shock before that rat tat tat tat tat nose rings
And I'm so high I could fuck around and grow wings
Then I heard my phone rang hold up that's my old dame
Pick it up I hit you back miss me and I miss you back
You should come on home leave the drugs alone and stick to rap
I bet you wish you had a Benz cause you just helped you friends
Made your way to 7th ave. Flagged a yellow cab
Now you need an upper fast to help your mellow swag
Hold ya purse don't trust him cause his teeth is golden
Have a fix of this acid drip
Eye for an eye drip for a drip
I can supply the fix for ya drip
You know I looked at the crowd and you know I
And I know that damn well
We are some partying mother fuckers
Tired of these dances by these backpackers
And I'm sick of all these hipsters
I'm sick and tired of your facade and all of your lying and all your diamonds
Ain't on stage behind the scene
I'm probably mixing lean
Why don't ya come and take a sip with me
Once again Mr. Back selling crack
Half of the other side don't live it they push play
It feels good waking up to money in the bank
Cause last year it was shoe box and lint
Ain't on stage behind the scene
I'm probably mixing lean
Why don't ya come and take a sip with me
Purple and the green got me on stuck
Ain't on stage behind the scene
I'm probably mixing lean
Why don't ya come and take a sip with me
Let me know know what's up
Before I roll roll one up
Puff puff pass take a drag just don't steam it tho
Mama said leave weed alone but I think I need it oh oh
That's why all these hoes wanna hop and jump on my dick
Uh and tell me what you think about it
Now my high is higher than its ever been
That one day that my team
We can make it with this rapping
Straight what's happening
They try to intellect with indirection just to test you
Fuck the clique you with
You know the kid get it
Money in the cabinets
Stuffed in the mattress
More money up in that shit
Riding with a feature
Student and a teacher
It's money over bitches
Turn Rocky into Rambo
While I got my hands closed
When you said I shouldn't rap
Now I'm in the basement
Probably cooking crack
Gave you teaspoons full
Ain't enough to get me home
When they compare me to Drake
Reincarnated through me
Diamonds in by new gleam
I ain't bragging when I do this
And your foolishness and rumors
I only hear the money
My bitch is the rudest
And my wrist is the bluest
ASAP standing on the block
Trigger finger itching fuck parental supervision
Toking on that biscuit till I'm no longer existing
Who said you can't live forever lied
Who said you can't live forever lied
And I take it out to Memphis so shout out to triple six
Who said you can't live forever lied
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Everybody play the tough guy till shit pop off
Let's take it to the basics
You in the midst the greatness
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
You aim it for you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
Until I tell them to they face they ain't no G
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Everybody play the tough guy till shit pop off
And them red bottom loafers just to compliment the mink
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
I just pray to God that the shit go right
Little arguments in their fists don't fight
I could've been a criminal and just rolled dice
Harlem world my whole block strapped
Hoes all on my jock strap
My whip white but my top black
Take a ride to make this high
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
Fuck around and bring the hush puppies back
The block hot so I'm shaded in my bucket hat
And don't get head from hoes with overbites
High as a kite in my Nike Flights
Made 30 Racks it was just a flight
Turn a baby into a lady
Now here go the keys to my new Mercedes
All you got to do is tip her
She got ballers with some money
Now do A through Z for a G
Panties go down to her feet
Pussy get wetter for me
Take a ride to make this high
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
Thousand dollar drawers just to hold my balls
All I ever do is let my jewels sag
All this talk of Illuminati ain't got a clue about me
Wit a strap in a backpack
We use to wear rugged boots now it's all tailored suits
Or end up in the tombs or living in the boondocks
Riding by the rules I'll abide by it soon
See the situation we sophisticated goons
Know you live by the gun then you die by it too
White on white wagon call that motherfucker Socrates
There your reasons go bitch
It won't take me long
It won't take me long
My mama always told me keep your mind on your money
Boy you better pay attention
It won't take me long
It won't take me long
It will hit you on the head
You don't even gotta hit me now babe
You can see me long gone
Really you know that we don't come how we get down
Knew that was a Rocky ahead
And you don't really what is up
It won't take me long
It won't take me long
It won't take me long
Tell me who you'd call when no one else around
Bitch I'm hard and my lube come free
Too much boss if you ask me
These male groupies doing it
Getting dirty money but I keep my hand sanitized
Bring ya girls to the crib maybe we can solve it
Make that thing pop like a semi or a nine
Oh baby like it raw with a shimmy shimmy ya
Never met a motherfucker fresh like me
All these motherfuckers wanna dress like me
Put the chrome to your dome make you sweat like Keith
Bring ya girls to the crib maybe we can solve it
I know you love it when this beat is on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feeding on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
Bring ya girls to the crib maybe we can solve it
Yeah ho this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she's from the hood but she live inside in the valley now
That mean your friends need to be up to a par
See my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Don't get involved listen what the crystal ball say
Wake up feeling blessed up
Pistol on that dresser
Sipping on that syrup till I'm messed up like yeah sir
Going wild for the night Fuck being polite
You don't really wanna feel them shots boy
Drunk as fuck and I'm ready to fight
I don't mean no harm but won't you and your friends
Meet us in the cut and we can do the business
God my witness that I only wanna kick it
And yo girl just said they with us
She got drunk as fuck and swallowed all my kids
She flat on her back and it's back to the track
That's sweet and you won't come back front of that
And you know them soak and bitches blow and reefer got me open
Feeling like a vigilante or a missionary
Ever since this new star fame came about
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff
Don't sell rocks seen the spectrum through the prisms
But pass the pot let me skillet
And I swear it hurt me soul
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon's reflection off the lake hit me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses drop on boxes very often
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist I've got the briefcase
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes and cherish your wins
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won't have to drop another album
Spikes and patent leathers if the fabric makes you different
Bloody ink on my pad spelled suicide
Michael Jackson even passed cause you scrutinized
Now all hail to the Lord like you do to God
I've seen the ghetto gospel
The choir like my reefer and the preacher got my eyes low
Shits to Mary Jane to make me see from singing high notes
The bible or the rifle... goodnight folks
Bloody ink on my pen spelled suicide
Kurt Cobain even died cause you scrutinize
It's a fine line between truth and lies
It's all part of the plan
I swear this famous shit just happened overnight
I guess that's why the crackers kept me after school
Everybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fist fights
And fish fries and shootouts like one SIG with two rounds
Just to put a snack up in the fridge
It was just like yesterday
And now I'm comfortable
I just only can thank God
Everything changed before my eyes
Bitch motherfuckers trying to fake it trill
Don't get someone sawed up
I bang out in Florida
Of course you're forced to
Still that pretty motherfucker
Sophie sniffed a line of ye
But grab the jimmy so the bitch don't get no cash up out me
I think back to my early days
Let the Lords toast with the Lords
Do just what I tell you
Don't come in any closer
And no one will get hurt
Outcast my whole life so I decide to spit like Andre
And my closet is like a runway
My rooftop got a lounge
Just a sit around and watch her sunbathe
Yeah my mouth is full of gold and I'm a city boy
Once she blow my whistle
She know it's dismissal
Spread the news I'm official
Now hop out my foreign vessel
Before I get aggressive
Tears and blood invested
Till my cardiacs arrested and my 40 oz is empty
Black magic on the tires only I
And my chain it may slow me down cheer for
Don't complain I came to reign
So crib got clear doors
Burning grains in my air force
And all I can see is clear ports
These rappers is all my entrée
And the motherfuckers come in to cry
Guess that's when a girl sip the white
Tip tipped and toe I miss the sky
Beneath choose souls you will reside
They call me young drug dealer
24 karats my slugs glitter
24 years old worth a couple million
Down to let it fly when I shouldn't
Hood by air man I started that
Well your name is purple I'm the God of that
Hoes on the curb a couple of friends
She give head to my kin folk
Hoes gone skeet and the V gone swerve
I thought you said you'd never leave
I think back as I took a puff
Know what happens every time you wanna leave
Know what happens every time you speed
So we could take it slow
Separate the highs from the lows
Separate the evens from the odds
I just hope you put me back together when I come apart
Can't last forever...
Felt a little less pressure from you
And I'm here to say I
Make it even under lessons from me
If you find a way to fight the pain which we endure
If you fly away then rest assured...
Can't last forever...
Reconstructing all the pieces I left in my way
Especially hard to express to me
European attitude but born in West Philly
They ask me why I don't go to church no more
Cause church is the new club and wine is the new bub
And lies is the new drugs
My usher the next tricker
The game is full of slaves and they mostly rappers
The pastor had a thing for designer glasses
Won't let the pearly gates up in this
Probably do that on your poor behavior
My mentor got a couple tips to save ya
I'm just a kettle from the ghetto with no pot to piss in
I went from roaches on my bump to red broaches on the cuff
Changed the game and made them say Uh
I remember when I got a hundred for recordings
I know I'm a scum bag and now your heart broke
How the fuck am I supposed to live
How many fucks am I supposed to give
How the fuck am I supposed to feel
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick
You the one that was putting up with me
You see how this screecher wrote to me
I got a coco everything in front of me
Go to fuck your ho after you turn on me
This killer she's awfully into me
I know I'm a scum bag and now your heart broke
I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
She ain't a stranger to the city life
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Another quarter to the face system
It started in Hollywood
My tongue at a loss for words
Party just started up
Held this feeling for way too long
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
I spent 20 thousand dollars with my partners in Bahamas
It started in Hollywood
My tongue had a loss for words
I learned that from a very wise man
I spent 20 thousand dollars with my partners in Bahamas
Ain't got time to make excuses bro we steady making moves
I pay very close attention after that I pay my dues
Cup full of purple substance or something
Ain't got time to make excuses bro we steady making moves
I pay very close attention after that I pay my dues
Yo I've been feeling that real JD swag lately
Kick it with my model chick
It's a shame how they low down
I could really give a fuck about your feelings
Got a bitch that's in the spot and she faded
All I wanna see is green faces
All I wanna count is green numbers
Only took a little bit of patience
Shorty she like to pop ass high
Popped her way up to first class high
Shorty she like to pop ass high
Popped her way up to first class high
With your electric body
With your electric body
She the type to seek love and make it everlasting
I'm the type to wake up and say you're never having
But it's cold how we smashing
Left her sleeping on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice
This ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
I be damned if I die sober
And shout outs my pretty women in the spot tonight
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Might add a preacher and a choir to it
Sit back and watch me do it
Okay let's get past all the swag trapping and fashion talking
Ain't nothing better than the pretty big forehead bitch
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia
Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather
And hope to fly away one day just like some love birds
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when it's your advice
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member
Man everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo
They wanna throw me under a white jail
Commissary missing like your sibling's paw
Granted what I did was wrong
Pigs don't show remorse if you admit it all
It's like I lace up my boots and call my troops lately
I'm 26 but I've been living in my youth lately
Now this the kind of story that should make doves cry
Ain't too late to pause or skip...
And I can't face it all I need is right where I belong
And I can't face it all I need is right where I belong
Sometimes I wish I could get away and charter spaceships
As I lay me down to sleep I pray to God I rest in peace
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Gentrification split the nation that I once was raised in
I don't recall no friendly neighbors face on my upraising
Back in my younger days or razor blades with gangs who bang and never stood a chance
It's the irony how LSD inspired me to reach the high in me
Used to never give a damn now I don't give a fuck entirely
If you seen the shit that I'd have seen in 26 years of living
That's how many fucks I've given
And I can't face it all I need is right where I belong
As I lay me down to sleep I pray to God I rest in peace
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Now I'm richer off the shit I thought of
From the home of the richest ballers
I'm Richard Porter mixed with Mr. Porter
I went to France and almost got deported
The fans is screaming when I hit the border
I visit Nice like it's my sisters daughter
He think he want a war but he don't really wanna go
Don't give a fuck bout where you're from
Don't give a fuck bout how you feel
Your girlfriend a groupie like Trident she wanna chew me
Get money is the main reason most people wake up
It's an everyday struggle for the almighty dollar
Real up in your field and man it make you wanna holler
Candy paint is gonna drip that stain
See ain't a damn thing change but the weather
These days of preference has no complexion
Ride from overseas but that's basic
Wasted high on the west side highway
New Dior from the boutique store
Only thing in common that we got is that we want it all
Or we can kiss till the sun come up
Girl just wanna have fun till the fun run up
These days of preference has no complexion
Ride from overseas but that's basic
Wasted high on the west side highway
Don't give a fuck about your man
I'm just seeing what it's hitting for
You should fuck with me girl
You know what you need girl
Swear that I can't get no rest in California
Swear that life is just a whole bunch of vices
Stay up in your chick ride stick without a license
Tell her hold on like some vice grips
Fucking each and every Katy Perry for the night bitch
A generation's thrown on drugs
I swear that bitch Rita Ora got a big mouth
Next time I see her might curse the bitch out
Bitches sniff raw of the kilos
Now I got a penthouse and a beach home
Me and Yams made the plan
Then I paid myself and I gave myself advance
Way before I became myself
I'd like to thank myself because I made myself the man
It's like lately I ain't myself
I'd rather hang myself before I play myself
Get all the bitches jealous when you do that shit
I'm surprised that we made it
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded
Nowadays stress overrated
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded
I wanna see you take it all off
And she just wanna make it harder
And we just end up taking longer
See the same thing all up in my bank account
But I don't even trip though
Do it like you got a point to prove to any chick
Any dudes that you that bitch
I wanna see you take it all off
And she just wanna make it harder
And we just end up taking longer
I woke up and then I bought that bitch in every yellow
Where the darks and the light skin kids
Get along with the white percents
Or alike when the lights go dim
I just had an epic dream like Dr. King
Police brutality was on my TV screen
Everyday I spend my time
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand
So everyday I spend my time
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
To another dimension my mind
Probably going ballistic but listen
I'm missing a couple of screws
Go to church and pray to father Lord forgive us
And only God can judge me
And he don't like no ugly
Yeah I'm a piece of shit
I know I plead the fifth
The devotion it's getting hopeless
Behold it I'm getting closest
My soul is I'm seeing ghosts
Hypnosis overdose on potions
Adjusting to the motions
And getting out all my emotions
Everyday I spend my time
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand
So everyday I spend my time
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
And a message to the bosses
Wanna show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Hood dudes usually don't look like you
The only key to survive in getting a piece of the pie
Is to agree with them a lot or just believe a facade bitch
And I'll be fine just drinking my wine bitch
But I don't need love no more
But I don't need love no more
Everyday I spend my time
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand
Everyday I spend my time drinking wine
Waiting here to find the sign
I don't care if I ever know
But I don't need love no more
But I don't need love no more
It's like my fashion style is the life saver
Bragging that her new ass shots is a life changer
Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long
Pissed me off then tried to hold it against me
Or wish we off the worst luck that ever hated
You stored in my memory all of the doors that I thought of
Means walk from my enemies
Bitches been sniffing
How in the fuck could you front on em
In a country called Earth
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
No preliminary hearings on my record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say
Everyday my logic get another dollar just to keep you
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Dark nights in my prayers
I remembered you was conflicted
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
The evils of Lucy was all around me
Since it's so rare so there's a whole land left in distress
And the government are cutting only checks
Since it's so rare so there's a whole land left in distress
If knowledge is power and power is knowledge
Since it's so rare so there's a whole land left in distress
We come together every time
We lose ourselves tonight
Everyone must be wondering why we try
Maybe in our wildest moments
Maybe in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all
Maybe in our wildest moments
Maybe in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all
I've been looking at you too much
Everyone must be wondering why we try
Maybe in our wildest moments
Maybe in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all
Maybe in our wildest moments
Maybe in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all
Looking back on the set
Are you thinking what if
What if we ruined it all
Everyone must be wondering why we try
Maybe in our wildest moments
Maybe in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all
Maybe in our wildest moments
Maybe in our wildest moments
I gotta close the window before I record
Cause New York don't know how to be quiet
Keep your girl head in my Tommy boxers
All she get is hard dick and some Cheerios
Bet I put him in the dirt with the penny loafs
Trinidad maniac with a all gold hearse
So much work he'll smoke up the Earth
He shot me so I had to do it
Baby don't pray for me pray for the weak
Got a chick that worked at Magic
All they know is suck and fuck and speak a different language
All they know is suck and fuck and speak a different language
They tried to cut off my cable
Couldn't even watch The Wire
They'll make you see the fire or
They'll take you to the lake
Just a bunch of young lords underground with the gods
I could put the devil on my shoulder
Whispered in my ear like it's over
The flight longer than the stay
My nights longer than my day
Wanna ball but it's hard to bounce
From the streets to the sweet life
Addicted to the G life
So my trigger finger right here
Got a bucket of Cris and a tub full of chips
Window down and we're caught in flight
Window down and we're caught in flight
Window down and we're caught in flight
Me and Dame tried it to the max
Got these monkeys on our backs
If it's what I've seen then it's taxed
Paranoia got me watching all my friends
I make it out this Hell I'll never sin again
Gotta peep the vision
If there's a monster inside of here
Well I'm gonna keep it clear
I wish it would take all these things and go
There's no more we need to know
In the club to myself
If there's a monster inside of here
Well I'm gonna keep it clear
I wish it would take all these things and go
There's no more we need to know
If there's a monster inside of here
Well I'm gonna keep it clear
I wish it would take all these things and go
You've got a mouthful of diamonds
And a pocket full of secrets
Fantasize about a week on acids
You've got a mouth full of diamonds
With a mouth full of diamonds
And a pocket full of secrets
You've got a mouth full of diamonds
Life is what you make it
And a pocket full of secrets
I've seen some shit you wouldn't believe that made me leave the scene
Before my shit was even out you couldn't wait to get it
So next album fuck around and make you wait till Christmas
You've got a mouth full of diamonds
With a mouth full of diamonds
And a pocket full of secrets
You've got a mouth full of diamonds
Life is what you make it
And a pocket full of secrets
That'll pop shots and your pop drop
Clear these socks still my stock pop
Used to trap like a hot spot
How could you not cop
Stopped me in a drop top
Had to get my shit together
We can get that shit wherever
Put that two and two together
This my last year being broke
This my last year being broke
This my last year being broke
This my last year being broke
Posted by the corner store
Fuck that shit just light the dope
Shit steady on my mind
Shit I'm heavy on my grind
Should I do a suicide
Grips gets scrutinized
That be with them killers
That be with the bitches
Gotta free the bitches that'll creep up in ya squad
Man I handle business
I don't gamble wit it
This my last year being broke
This my last year being broke
This my last year being broke
This my last year being broke
Shit was all kinda psychedelic colors
You know we was playing the old Ron G tapes
I need a week in Tahiti
I spend the weekend in Fiji
I'm on a boat if you need me
She on the coast in bikinis
I mix patron with the kiwis
Don't want the moment to leave me
I just got back from Japan
I pour some heat for my bitches
I'm like a Lee how I kick it
I can't believe how I did it
My people preaching my scriptures
I'm posing peace in my pictures
I mix the weed with the liquor
It's a god damn shame
Used to hop off them trains
Somewhere in the middle of France
Live everyday like a celebration
Came a long way I knew we'd make it
Never mattered how much time we taking
Okay I got love for my city
Know I keep that shit in me within my heart and my soul
You know I ride for my Pros
We came up from the low
Where's the love for the underdog
So don't make me get the gun involved
Catch a charge and run to Baltimore
When I'm coming down only time I'm falling off
This that lavish shit y'all tumble for
I got the sun involved
These my feelings in a couple bars
Sun shining like a fucking star
Them every night make a knot boys
That every night make a knot boys
Big semi on they side
My eye up on the prize
You always gotta strive
Take your piece of devil pie
Now my level rising high
See a ribbon in the skyline
Them every night make a knot boys
That every night make a knot boys
Presently showing you how to make a tune sound
Make the roof pound if you play the levels too loud
Impossible to cool down
I come from heaven and it's nice to meet you
Faulty images I can see through
But if you remain tolerant
And when you're dead look where your dollar went
It should all be common sense
But look at what the single word greed got us in
And then you caught again
I can remember when all I wanted was to have things
But now it's not what I can give but what I can bring
That you can see that is stale
Cause the way this country is it could be me in the cell
But that's highly unlikely
Of hip hop formed tightly
But if you remain tolerant
And when you're dead look where your dollar went
It should all be common sense
But look at what the single word greed got us in
Hieroglyphics in the house y'all
For y'all greedy bastards out there
Souls of Mischief in the house
My man Del in the house
In the studio my man God is in the house
Nobody do it better than us
I ain't get in the game for fifteen minutes of fame
The deck is stack and the odds are two to one
I rock shows and the crowd moves in unison
She told me take my glasses off but she looks horrendous
I had my first pair of ray bans when I was ten tricks
Came to the club fresh up out the airport
I keep my shades on in the hot sun
I tore that pussy up like a ligament
She don't like her man so she asked me for deliverance
Who plead the Blood in the name of the Son
I stimulate your mind and thoughts
The reward is up in Heaven
Who plead the Blood in the name of the Son
To change the world and now it's my ambition
Some folks who thought that that we would never make it
So bow down to a T H C C O M C I T Y T H U G
Soldier solute now if you wit me
Believe me it ain't easy been who we are
We some mighty mighty warriors
We some mighty mighty warriors
I'm quick to flip and cause a hit can you feel me
Satan better grab his bag and better hit his feet
Serve the Gospel on the block to those in search of salvation
Here we come you can't stop me
It be the S N to the double O P Y L O C
See you can't drop me. see them demons they wanna pop me
We hell's most wanted
We Hell's Most Wanted and we crazy from this 2 5 3
You step to me you get no respect and I know you hate it
Because I'm Hell's Most Wanted
I'm here to open up your eyes so that you can see
Tell the judge he better study the law
Watch us do it to be the hardest in town still we undisputed
That's why I ride wit a mean mug
And can't see how 5 mortals
Changes lives of others
Hell's Most Haded can't be faded but you can't see me
I've tried everything to destroy them
They're adopted by me
I don't deserve this love from you
Your grace protecting me o Lord
Your love it changed my life
And I don't deserve this love from You
I'm sorry but I can't explain it
I don't deserve this love from you
Your grace protecting me o Lord
Your love it changed my life
And I don't deserve this love from You
I'm sorry but I can't explain it
Yeah anybody gotta problem with the king of the streets
I'm from the block where they take they claim and fore they yell out they name they throws it up
I'm young but I'm old school like Corduroy and when I get pissed I'll make the whole city take a time out
The record label still ain't come up with my money
Everybody wanna see me flop if I fall off they smile if I come up they can't stand it
So a 3 piece chicken wing dinner that's what I ate
But we had us a vision like Jordan with Hang Time
Haters on dick but I'd rather run it in they spouse
It ain't hard to understand I'm on a different type of mission
I starved back then ain't nobody wanna listen
And that was way before I even had a pot to piss in
Now they greet me with the H every time I come through
I been a G all of my life and never act brand new
In the gutter guarantee me I'm a get it this time.
But don't get it twisted and play me for weak
Rest In Peace I'm a see you when I get there bro
I'm the truth for real and ain't just in a song
When they pick up in the trunk it's a hundred percent slow
I'm cool but the whip wanna pose
Yeah the trunk got a mind of it's own all I do is let it glow
It's the king of the streets and the king of the ghetto
Middle finger in the air when I wanna say hello
Call me what you want I use to chase after hoes
Plus everywhere you go you gotta deal with us like it or not
I really don't give a damn
He's real he is not one of these fake black men
But they don't know about Joseph Wayne
When I beat up a rapper he'll file charges on me
I'd rather die then live life in the Penitentiary
But these days you gotta be strapped
Even when I'm at home I go to sleep with the ghat
Get stuck at the intersection and watch the light change
I chunk up the deuce for the North and the South
And the boys with that hard and that soft in they house
I really don't give a damn
Only thing I get to give is the deuce
When I ride one of these 6 whips out the yard
I got goons in the trap for the right cost
I watch you leap out then I take a nice loss
I'm still in these streets like I ain't even hot yet
I do it for the hood like I can't even stop yet
They already know I'm the man
I really don't give a damn
When I get hungry I take flights out of town
To restaurants in other cities just to chow down
Pinocchio partners are the worse kind so
Any one of my cars or truck made by Lincoln
Whatever I gotta do to keep my blood in my skin
Not platinum yet but on my way please believe me
They started off hot and they still hot
Before Hawk died the last thing he said to me
I really don't give a damn
I can get your whole family wiped out for less than a G
I'm still educated and graduated to a criminal
A million dollars that is still seen in the ghetto
I'm insane in the membrane I don't have positive thoughts
I remember we use to steal in the hood
I'm a Asshole By Nature I make it Rain real good.
Let it be known I remember what it was from day 1
You ain't never seen the type of drama that I live in
And I got the same attitude that I had last year
If you don't like it fuck you now bitch get that clear
In and out of these kind of like birds in a flock.
Leave me the fuck alone I ain't friendly bitch
They say I'm a celebrity with diamonds that'll blind you
My hammer cocked back I stay ready for surprises
My bond money stay ready to bail me out
When my home boys sell me out.
I'm a hop in the Hoop like a troop then I shoot like Wade
It be the same routine when any block get sprayed
I was taught to never put the bullshit to the side
And bring the K out and try to leave the whole block blitz.
When we load these K's.
Y'all didn't wanna kick it when I was down on my ass
Only thing I need is the help of the good Lord
When I be down and out nobody wanna come and kick it
I'm a nobody until I can shine
So when my money is long I don't need nobody to visit
Leave me lonely like you did last time.
But I don't really give a damn about none of y'all
First off fuck each and every one of y'all
I be a loner on my own alone hang with my chrome
I feel they want me headed to the grave
With a 9 about to misbehave
Same old shit with a friend or a foe
Look at me now and all the shit that I sell
And everybody who doubt that can go to hell
So I like how it feel when I'm left all alone.
When I be down and out nobody wanna come and kick it
I'm a nobody until I can shine
So when my money is long I don't need nobody to visit
Leave me lonely like you did last time.
You must've thought I forgot when I was stuck on the block
And hoes don't call my cellular phone
The only thing that y'all know how to do is lie.
So they feminine conversations don't even disturb me
When I be down and out nobody wanna come and kick it
I'm a nobody until I can shine
So when my money is long I don't need nobody to visit
I spit flames and got games to seduce your momma
And even at age 9 I was king like Tutankhamen
Shorty with the baddest attitude see that's the one that will fuck
Plus the Don hard to see like weed smoke in dark rooms
Stay fly and high to pocket gridlock
Diamond chip watch at 20 a chock and a shot of scotch
Catch me at the bar with the players
Yo this is the dirt that rock the party
And drop 30 with 10 assists then reminisce
I'm the dirt that rock the party ya hardly can guard me
I even seen my dreams come through
I seen coke on triple beams and fiends come through
I seen big willies in every city
This shit is real on the block
Now I want the cash today
That seen two die from the same gun
I seen my friends turn to enemies
I seen peeps turn to memories
I even seen who shot Kennedy
I seen the feds take flicks
With needles in they arm
I seen big Porter get robbed out
Ice and get duffed out
Another issue I gotta touch on
I even seen the President blow trees and get his fuck on
Pregnant chicks carried and flossed
Jesus carried a cross
I seen the statue carry the torch
On some sixth grade shit
I seen brains on the pavement
I seen buster bitches pimp pimps
And dimes fuck for free
Time to bounce with this female
I hit the block and stop hoes with the drop Rolls
Me and Tone flipped burgers to buy clips for burners
Ignore you cats with the boring tracks
But I was born to rap
Now you're stranded in the back of the bricks
You can catch us in a Aston Martin
And flip and hit your squadron
The feds wanna put my ass away
Earlier took your girl to a matinée
Need to go back and pray
You might get hit this time when I spit this rhyme
To when I was a youth and rowdy
You don't know who you wanna be with
And you don't know who you wanna creep with
And you don't know who you wanna sleep with
See you the same bitch that fucked the whole hood
And you don't know who you wanna be with
The Dirty Don is the dirt that'll rock the party
Feel me more when I don't show love to you
I can't believe I used to have a crush on you
I zone to Pluto and you don't
I rep really when I'm wet then I step to the next city
No surrender no retreat
Every day catch me on the block
I make you wish you was never born
And we can fuck yo bitch
But I'm the type that set you up
And I don't give a fuck
I seen you in the club about to smack the ho out you now
I'm like a mean coke I never go out of style
But I got some gorillas at my disposal
And still stand all the smoke
I'm the same on the train or with the whip
We get the DJ open and watch you witness it
... Roll that ... light that ... smoke that
... This track ... is fat ... light that
You wanna brawl or ball I won't fall at all
I probably hit you with a track on consignment
Words from a master poet
... Roll that ... light that ... smoke that
... This track ... is fat ... light that
... Roll that ... light that ... smoke that
... This track ... is fat ... fuck that
I sex them chicks and send them home
Then later on I had to wild out
I got more dimes than that Sprint lady
Yo try to tax and watch the nine mill burst
I've been off the scene over three years
L is rap's most livest cat
The one police wouldn't dare chase
I did a flick and bounced on L's shit
After platinum it's the same thing
Till I pull the steel and make they lover burn
Here's my flamethrower
Corrupt cats kept slug hats
Asked the feds where the bugs at
You choose the path you take
Yours was a big mistake
You put yourself at stake
Now I think it's time to get back to.
Whatever it takes to make
Whatever it takes to make you
Because you want things your way.
Where we're headed you're NOT going
It's so dirty they can't believe that we did it
Pack a shorty at the bar then leave with it
I'm too pulled for some heads like dust mixed with lye
This verse here is better than ya whole CD
Pack a shorty at the bar then leave with it
Gotta show you on the video to see where ya ass went wrong
Pack a shorty at the bar then leave with it
It's another one of them things
One two check me out uh
I spit flames on these other rappers
Kick a hole in the speaker...
Out of bounds in here
I'll put 20 that's long money for any that's better
Just when I thought I had the bomb dick
And I lounge and I chill with it
Smack it and flip it and ill with it
Had to pause when she said it's her girlfriend Kim
She really thought I wouldn't hit it
My girl and her friend and it ended up porno
But they love it when I perform slow
That's the norm though
I kept my poise then I calmly responded
Than one million of your fake fanatics behind me
If you ever see me wit the Feds you can bet it's in the cuffs
Official thugs in the drug profession
All I need is 26 letters and 16 bars
Convey it in a way that sounds so dope
You wanna quote and learn to say it
If we don't climax we can't blame you
Everywhere I go it's thugs and drugs
Take you back to the origin of this
Grab my dick and force it in your bitch
You can catch me in a silver 7
Let them hear that shit
We got the dirt y'all can't live without
I get up in that ass with no moist
We married to the game and if rap divorce us
Besides she probably put a hole in the scrotum
Instead I blow smoke like locomotion
Talk about legends don't leave my name unspoken
The weed don't stop till my eyes is black
This goes out to all the dope emcees
Shouts to L... my gun cocks and son got left
And my girl better empty hers
But I got one question
But you still continuing to act up
Get to cruise and ride tonight
Cause somebody's gonna die tonight
Plates covered with black tape
With their money on my mind
Running down my trigger finger
All of the sudden tables turn quick from nowhere
I guess I'm gonna die tonight...
The world is trouble yo
And a man needs some madness
Or else he dare not cut the rope and be free
Make that legal paper baby
You gonna fall on the side
Put your hands up in the sky
You wanna rock a party to the morning sun
Give me 68 kisses and I owe you one
It's all right with me
It's all right with me
And whatever you need babe
I am in love with you
And whatever you need babe
Here's another one of them type of jams
That you have to read between the lines
Till death do us part
They say I'm a dreamer
But shit my heart's so damn cold
And like no matter what happens
In the end we grow old
I was told that many times before
I got my shit together
That life's just a dream
Or that it doesn't last forever
I know better then to ever think some shit like that again
Right now my only friend be a nickel plated sin
That a man must depend on
I wrote this song for all the fuel
I'd rather die on my feet
Than to live on my knees
Accept my meaning of the people just like me
A doubt within our minds
That makes us take a different route
Believe in what you want
I'm just like any other man
I was at the bar with my drinking team
Now here came Margarita and her friend Shirley Temple
He said that Shirley was a virgin and I wouldn't wanna meet her
Now I'm not one for a speech
But there was plenty of Tequila and Sex on the Beach
At the bar with the drink in my hand
I didn't wanna stick around
I woke up in the morning and felt like a zombie
The Tequila Gold Label had bombed me
Here came Shirley Temple and they told me to chill
Because the Mickey Brothers took her up to Strawberry Hill
Cause the Tequila that she drank had her tickled pink
Now the music came on and I rocked the instrumental
A groupie is a girl that jocks
She wore a def Black Velvet and drank Scotch on the rocks
Now everybody take a couple of words from the wise
I once knew a bitch named Mercedes Benz
Her and Lexus wanted to sex me and all my friends
About a pound and so we rolled slow
Plus I kept my Eyes out for Five Point O
She said I doesn't want to trouble you
And my heart started pounding I'm out the back window
I got a friend named Alfa Romero
And he calls her his Sidekick
But the bitch is so fly that he gotta have a big dick
He pulled us ova in a fucked up Nova
I'd like to tell you more homeboy but I'm Audi 5000.
Who kicks it with this Japanese bitch they call Samurai
I got to the club and met a snobby ass bitch
Who said I was the voice she said I was the choice
And could I please give a little bit to Ms. Royce Royce
Silk sheets and my hips they were pounding
The owners on his knees and he's out in the front
Plus I was high as a kite and I've been drinking.
Only three blocks from the police station
But I pulled the trigger three times no hesitation.
As I sped away I put the Nine at my hip
It's all about a foot game I knows I'm gonna win it.
Then I got ghost like a phantom in the fog
Then I broke the window with the butt of my gun.
I used up four of my shots
The SWAT team came I better think fast
Here comes the tear gas that's my ass
I'm out the back I almost made it
But the cops black German shepherd means I'm faded
I shot him three times and sent his ass to doggy heaven
I'm zipping chronic getting stoned
Got Jenny on the phone
I want them fellas to do the fist
Or I'll do the chronic missed
About to throw but with a tight whip
Run up to the old school
And tell them fuck you
And tell them fuck you
And tell them fuck you
And tell them fuck you
And tell them fuck you
Flipping rhymes to represent
Till your speakers catch a dense
Breaking hard legs till I shake the confidence
It's only common sense
You have to face the consequence
If you man enough to step to the bitch you off against
Giving girls some debt about shake this sucker loose
I slap handicapping and watching bet for more abuse
Excuse the hushed behavior but I just don't give a damn
So I'm pissed some people lost soul to remember who I am
My name and mama would I put to squeeze on any man
And tell them fuck you
And tell them fuck you
And tell them fuck you
And tell them fuck you
And tell them fuck you
Time for pussy freaking putting it down for nine nine
Then I make him see the light
As my right hand to flip start dumping
On the way from Cypress Hill
I think I popped a pill on a reel
With my head in the clouds
I see some fists up in the air and the colors are brown
And tell them fuck yo
And tell them fuck yo
And tell them fuck yo
And tell them fuck yo
The question still remains
Mona wanna loan her but I already told her
Tried to buy a burger but I only got a pickle
A brand new Pinto only in dreams
I'll offer you a soda and a piece of frozen pizza
Don't ask for a nickel and please take a hint
If you ain't got dollars then you ain't got sense
Trying to get her hands on some doll
That was never cool and all the honeys never liked it
Mexicans win but this one can't afford the lotto
Jehovah's leave me alone because my socks are really holy
Don't ask for a penny and please take a hint
If you ain't got dollars then you ain't got sense
Trying to get her hands on some doll
I doesn't have a penny but I won't accept a handout
Her time is always out so she always thought I planned it
Mom said I can stay but only till I'm thirty
I never had no money but it really doesn't matter
If you ain't got dollars then you ain't got sense
Malice saying we to hot
From roaming low into homes
Still true to his roots
Stay close to the chrome
Haters stay clear of him
Y'all stay in cheer for him
Got up out the game and over came
Keep a new toy so I wonder how good
I'm not enjoying life I'm reliving my childhood
Motherfucker and I ain't stutter
From holding nose to roles gold
Before him I'm to shame to show my face
But she's so mean can't help but to fall off the race
The man the music the making the king
Constantly built by me
A million men marching like Calling them the King Kong
The verse making the world sing
Y'all basically just like my opinion
The bars hoping the sun shines on them
It's like an itch you can't scratch
It's like a bitch you can't shake
In this climate I'm Kareem Burke tied in
Suffocation blue in the insides potato sack
Of your dreams and forgetting what her name is
I still wanna sell kilos
It's like I'm throwing rocks at the pen begging for the Rico
I still wanna sell kilos
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like you Tito
I still wanna sell kilos
How you think I felt knowing daddy wasn't there
Recycling cans cause nobody ever cared
Piecing puzzles together solving homicides of I's
Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale
The Rose bottles pour for the champions
Thousand keys that I'm about to do Pilate's on
More alive than a newborn unicorn in the sky
And I just get more fly by the second I wreck it
That immortality is not a myth or just a lie
Sublime rhyme and reason being why
Understand exactly what it takes to be creative
And display greatness the dedication it takes
The time consumption the stakes if you say it ain't high
That's a blind assumption and open your eyes or something
Multiply with nothing grip the skies
I open minds in hopes that you open your mind
Holding my fro and scoping the scene out
And spitting sixteens spitting my spleen out
Thought I had it made but ain't shit clean
With more insight than a encyclopedia
The Carson Arson warm enough to fight anemia
And I'm just warning up
You can touch the sky
They don't emulate they just antagonize
They don't illustrate they just be writing rhymes
They don't demonstrate they hide behind their lines
And on my rise to success
I'm just searching for the perfect concept
I swear I'll be the Einstein of my time
It's not E but AB equals MC squared
Higher than I've ever been these heights are mighty frightening
Throw ya hands up as if you wanna strike like lightening
Grab a bitch then grab ya dick
Pop a fifth and have a sip
Party every single night
So I just masturbate to her naked flicks
Sometimes I like to go on a tangent of random shit
I told Punch I'd probably get assassinated by the government
Tilt ya head you see me in the sky
Grab a bitch then grab ya dick
Pop a fifth and have a sip
Party every single night
Ya outlooks lousy someone needs a new window
A seed small as my pinkie can be your weeping willow
I'm so ill I'm held hostage at a hospital
Grab a bitch then grab ya dick
Pop a fifth and have a sip
Party every single night
Every time I'm arriving everybody excited
Let me get it back from the top Ali
I wonder will it take me underground like a runaway slave
I need to get away from the lights...
Flashing in my face like a topless model
When you bumping shoulders with the Grammy nominated
Every time I'm arriving everybody excited
Can't tell who real or who lying
Almost lost my life to the industry
And I ain't even sell one record yet
And she can see I'm hanging on barely
And my bitch say I'm arrogant
Not the clothing line but if the shit fit I wear it
Nobody ever said it'll be fair so
Every time I'm arriving everybody excited
Can't tell who real or who lying
So I can drown in my drink
And give myself some space to breathe
And the clouds are so at peace
So I can drown in my drink
And give myself some space to breathe
And the clouds are so at peace
I cut on the beat and if I feel it I wreck it
I heard I got fans and friends playing my records
Don't forget that dash in my name when you print it
It'll make me feel bleak like Jay's apprentice
I'm a God MC not a polytheist
And why is your reaction always so obvious
You'll see that despite all these dislikes I am like Jesus
Don't follow 10 commandments
But I don't seem to break to many of them either
And it ain't nothing new
Find the perfect words to rhyme it with
Ain't concerned with what ain't been confirmed
I'm doing swell I hope I can say the same for you
And made it true to take the mood
You think I am what I ain't
Soul brother number 2
And every single one of my dreams is coming true
I try to smoke weed to give me the fix I need
But it always ends up with me running out of tree
Tell me how I can get high as the sky and keep my ear to the streets
If I could hold you attention for at least a minute
You'll gain so much wisdom you'll need to see a dentist
Grow up in my society see why I'm a menace
And obviously ominous to your opinions
Call myself the King of Carson like I hold dominion
Hoping nobody notices that I had no permission
I don't mean to disrespect when I express
My vision was meant to connect not to reject
I said don't press eject...
And it ain't nothing new
Find the perfect words to rhyme it with
Ain't concerned with what ain't been confirmed
It ain't nothing new to me
Should be nothing new to you
Let's accomplish the impossible
It's nothing new under the sun
It's never what you do
Man I hope the magnum fit
Know I row the showboat
All aboard the penmanship
All I do is give you gifts
Every days December 25th
Everywhere you turn I'm there ya bitch
Why your grin so devilish
I was just a toddler in ninja turtle pajamas
Now I don't give a fuck
Heaven don't seem far from here
Take that bullshit elsewhere
And if you agree with me
Let me get a hell yeah
Let me get a hell yeah
And if you agree with me
Let me get a hell yeah
Schoolboy back up in this ho
Pussy holes and ash trays
Schoolboy back up in yo ho
Bitch might want my last name
Lil girl turn lost she a gang bang
No love so it's fuck the world
Got free and she fucked the world
Gamble with ya life and I'll roll the nine
Me and Soul locomotives that hauled off
Man we breaking all the rules
Take that bullshit elsewhere
And if you agree with me
Let me get a hell yeah
Let me get a hell yeah
And if you agree with me
Let me get a hell yeah
Mother fucker government
I'm just living how I am living
And he tell me something different
Man I hope the magnum fit
I hope she don't tell my bitch
God damn I'm so ignorant
At the same time so brilliant
Long term I got a legacy to leave my kids
And my landlord need a check
Hell yeah I'm a survive out here
Hell yeah I'm on the top of my shit
Hell yeah her tonsils topple on the top of my dick
We all know opposite attract
You to do anything you please
Hope it's in the gutter like mine
Not where you find rats
You know you want all this
Might want to make you my misses
Lady your smile light up the room
Let me rub on your neck
Till your Victoria's secret get all wet
And your Victoria's secret safe with me
Let me Victoria's secret leave your legs
I know you had a hard day baby
Soon as Christ turned water into wine
When things get hard to swallow
We can even do it tomorrow
Guess whose back in this mother fucker
I'll be in the gym all night
Came in the game with a dollar and a dream
With an AK clip with an infrared beam
Make everybody scream
On everybody's screen
My dick is big and my nuts is swollen
I don't know if you've noticed
Everything she need to get her thrill
No Hennessey on the bartender bill
Just a good wine and a good place to chill
I feel I might get loose tonight
And fuck your girlfriend
I mean I feel she might come through tonight
A chain and a diamond ring don't feel the same
I know you had a hard day baby
Soon as Christ turned water into wine
When things get hard to swallow
We can even do it tomorrow
You would have thought I was infatuated with being underrated instead of renowned
I too have my views like you
Look what I do to stand on stages in front of crowds
I need food but I'd rather smoke a black and mild
Get back in the booth and spill my heart until I bust a valve
I had faith in hip hop before she met biggie
Just take this shit a day at a time
I thought I was on after day in the life
But you know our shit get put on hold after reality strikes
You ain't know I knew how to bowl
My stomach sound like something in the jungle
It's easier to leave when you ain't got no dough
Cheap champagne wishes and thirty ratchet hoes
In my second childhood making music from the soul
Fill it with that good and take a toke
They think me and these other rappers have something in common
Go back to what's happening
Kendrick keep getting chased by cameramen
Looking for the right cannon
Most of all I need to exist in the fourth dimension
Labels calling for everybody except for me
Like I ain't got the recipe
Like this ain't my destiny
Especially considering I'm literally chasing a dream
He probably thought it was trash and threw that shit away
Don't get caught up in all of the marketing to show you up
All I do is go as hard as adult film costars
Soul brother number two times whoever you bring
Fucking wisdom tooth hurts
I can't even let it breath
I ain't got no second to spare
And the creature conceived in Korea
More of a reason to be a overseer
You know it feel like that though
Yes you were designed to fail
Look at your primitive brain
Look at your ignorant ways
Look at your innocent eyes
Don't take responsibility for your actions anyway
Spasms that you can't take
Even if the pit is full
Let's make that a mandate
Yes you were designed to fail
Look at your primitive brain
Look at your ignorant ways
Look at your innocent eyes
Think of all the bad decisions you made
In the past even to this day
That might be a bit much if it is in my intents to offend ya
And leave dents in your confidence
No you weren't designed to fail
What a magnificent brain
The media will never perceive us
Tomorrow was yesterday
Find a fine line between time and space
You'll be almost a star
You'll be almost a star
If you ain't got a dollar to your name
In my checking account
I even kept my receipt and my change
My life is like a movie
Some call it rap music
You never seen me heat the pot
You never seen no diamonds in my chain
Picture not having shit
What I am and what I am not
Chocolate swisher burn slow
Though I hope it never stop
And accomplish my endeavors
I mean so many lines that
Budget tighter than my bitch's all black bra strap
Grab a digital camera
Picture not having shit
You'll be almost a star
You'll be almost a star
In the presence of my gifted ass
Incredible gift of gab
Don't have a cent to spare
To where my Christmases was full of gifts
Left Santa milk and cookies
I don't remember what it said
But the point is that
Soon as I had to take the role for my own acts
I graduated with a car
Four years later that motherfucker's stuck in park
I missed the days we cut through the alley to the limo park
I keep these memories on my mind
Bliss kisses ignorance
And her pussy be wet as shit
You would come in a flash
Please hold the flash
Picture not having shit
No need to be camera shy
No need to be camera shy
I'm into Swisher Sweets and five dollar champagne
You should join my campaign before I lose my damn brain
I'm chasing a winning and I don't know if I'm losing or winning
So I'm in the Bugatti and got the burner too
I'd rather sticky my woody in a wonder woman
So good I might never want another one
Straight from the liquor store
My downfall will probably never be an incident though
Read the signs before you end up in a pile of shit
The least you can do is crack a window
I hope it hit you like a bus done run up into ya
I know it's nothing to ya
What I gotta make is something to ya
Put your fitted on the curb
I got that strict mentality
Smack you with a bottle that I picked up on the way in
That mean we fly like we wanna fly
Like quiet without the E
Sometimes it gets deep man
You will die in the deep end
But make sure it's three it's when you spell it
You only reap what you sow
You only get what you knit
I know exactly how it is to feel like no one cares
It sure wasn't me I take the bitter with the sweet
And boil it in the pot make it hard to eat
I said If I'm going to play I'm going to play for keeps
Somewhere with a killer view
But for now the studio couches gonna have to do
I ain't going to take what I ain't earned myself
That's what you need to survive
So step aside I don't mean no trouble
When I'm on the road I'm at the travel lodge not the W
The finish line is in sight but I'm almost there
Even if the sun don't shine the sun don't shine
Don't get caught up in the now
Focus on the years abroad
Cause today you're here but tomorrow you could be gone
Singing the same old song
Whatever it is you do
From slanging eight balls to graduating from school
Just gotta see it all before it happens
I ain't saying see a psychic I'm just saying have a
Idea of what you're accomplishing
You'll have a greater chance to accomplish it
Wins races nine times out of ten
Just know your future's right around the corner
Opportunity galore for ya
More and more you'll start to see it's no limit to what you can be
Treat your first like your last time
Cause it might be your last time
That's what I learned last time
Look forward to looking forward in my pastime
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
I brought you something close to me
And left with something new
See through your head
Nothing to do but believe
Man I done seen a thing or two of things that she or he will do
To fit in with each other nitpicking at each other
Soul brother number fucking two
I'm on this track like running shoes
I dedicate this one to Cletus Anderson for working harder than the average man
Or bend over backwards for his family
Doing whatever is you ask for him
He should be somewhere retired
And between me and you until we get a mill
Life smells like mildew
Wake and bake no taters
Survive by any means necessary even if it means dying
Instrumentals that give me a rhythm
Put the maze together and blaze
Would say I thought you knew but that would not be true
You fags are through and like all of you teachers thus far
Full clip left you stiff like a manikin
The state troopers would call off the shooters at dead run
It's going down I said
In a black borrow hound
Ace Ventura couldn't find no cure
So raw probably bite off the face of Hannibal
And this time I'm gonna do it my way
I hope you enjoy as much as I do
And I've got lots of it
Your short term tall tales won't sell here
It's been a hell of a ride
We live one hell of a life
Some are salty that I made it in the way I did
Let me tell you why I'm vexed
Thank God punchline knew I had a knack
Down two die to get my point across like craps
This shit sound like a 100 birds under the Carson Sheriff Station
When I roll through the city it give me a rush
Yeah I'm high off life but I'm rolling blunts
And they couldn't wait for Soul to reappear
Like I ain't never had shit
Never been locked up but I keep a sentence
Winners win and sinners sin only to ask God forgiveness
Just remember that they don't want me to get ignorant
Witness your future diminish
No present from Saint Nicholas in particular
You're just a thing of the past
I'm a diamond ring in the trash
Been running round since L train cut up at our people
But just imagine if Einstein got high and sipped juice
And I just took a number two
One time for the women
Hit ya two times for the ladies
Three times for the bitches
She ain't gotta be a genius to see it
I just hope the brain make me say Jesus Christ
I coexist in places you would never know existed
Top notch to my fucking socks
She'll never leave me alone
Man I hope she don't think I think she a ho
Got me harder than sneaking a bitch in Bohemian Grove
One time for the women
Two times for the ladies
Three times for the bitches
Bet I got some weed like Schoolboy Q
We night ride like Paul Revere
Top notch to my fucking socks
Maybe my sovereignty would still be mine
If all the gangs in the world unified
We'd stand a chance against the military tonight
I said we'd stand a chance against the military tonight
I said we'd stand a chance against the military tonight
At my window all I see is Babylon
On the news all I see is Babylon
I was from the projects like Jay Rock
But she don't know what the fuck I've been through
Ancient ways it's Sumerian
Ain't nothing wrong with a righteous man
This why I had to write this man
Selling water to somebody's daughter
Fluctuating prices man
Them AK Clips they extra peel
Smoking on some of that extra kill
We'd put the White House lights out today
We guarded like we the black KKK
I know you just a puppet but I'm giving you props
You lying to the public like it ain't nothing
I seen an image of Hitler in the picture
When the twin towers dropped
We protest in hopes they confess
Just proceed on your conquest
Nose got a ring like Soul For Real
So bags get stuffed like Oprah grill
Talk blue off low for some teal
Get lined up like homeless meals
You'll get stomped like a Broadway play
That owe me and it's in her daughter name
Got a feeling in his chest
And the world's stripped of happiness
Enjoy your mind trip but don't trip on your mind
No man is safe from the war going on outside
Please don't tell my mama this ain't marijuana
The black sheep running with a pack of wolves
Two white cups full of codeine
Plus I got two white sluts down to blow me
They failed in testing like what's inside of them
We in a space where matter don't matter
Just spirit molecules and geometric patterns
The new nucleus never sitting in a cell
I'm in a fucking lab coat rhyming as high as shit
One time for your mind
When the pressure group's setting in
On love making and making out
But she ain't having the best luck
Everybody who chop it up only want a cut
One of her girlfriends got one
She been jealous of the relationship since day one
But last week he made a pass at her
Unbutton his jeans and then she fell to her knees
She finally found company for her misery
See the moral of the story is
But her girlfriend's cut off like Edward's hands
What's fucked up is he got at her
My auntie told me always treat my lady right
You can see the immediate disconnection
I'm saying we heard of Amber Cole
Get screwed up like the neck on Frankenstein
Got a few two liters and it's about to go down
Then again it's the prescription of choice
Just call us the Finnegan boys
I got this funny little dream of buying out the bar
Then flexing in my section like a fucking star
They ask me what I like to drink and I say I'm all right
I hope it ain't cliché to shoot Pimp C a RIP
As well as DJ Screw since I made up this tune about lean
Like the Holy Bible and a Gucci Bag
I said look back at me when you hit the pole
How that sound I'm from the underground
They're gonna make me slang a pound
In interviews they always asking me about a lisp
Knowing damn well I'm looking like I'm slinging bricks
Heard it through the grapevine
Life for me is just weed and brews
Your body's calling me
Infinity when it comes to the possibilities
Anytime you're in my vicinity
This strange thing got me leaning
This reefer keep on steaming
And I believe that everything happens for a reason
I don't care about your religion
She be loving the crew and I be loving her too
She feeling my energy
Yeah she got that boomerang then I'm coming right back
She pulled a rabbit out a hat
Back when I first grabbed that pen
And I ain't know when
So you can take your top 5 list
Dead or alive and put me after Em
You can't tell me nothing
Still ain't really got no money fucking right
This ain't no motion picture
Even when the odds against you
They wanna see me wearing Polo drawers
Put 2 chains on and that ain't wrong
I don't need clothes or jewelry to stand out
Been killing this since Cam made Oh Boy
This business is quick sand and I won't sink
Put the pistol in my hand and I won't think
Further more we do this for y'all
That is until you lose appeal
And your release date gets date raped
I got two fifth and a loaf of bread
I know you know we need a few plaques too
I might even sell my new shit for 10 bucks too
Too ill when I jot these words
True eel when I shock the world
I know life's a bitch
When you know life's a bitch and that's not your girl
This is a shift in paradigm
I remember when I couldn't spare a dime
Now I step in with a pair of dimes
The best author ever to breathe
And as we proceed to follow these dreams
I ain't losing no sleep
Two cups and I sip slow
Time and time I drop line for line
But only time will tell
If I ever go Columbine
And cop 30 nines and cock back and kill
They wanna know how close me and Dre and Snoop is
Expectations or critics hating
Court cases get thrown out
So tell the motherfucking King dethrone now
I am the shit like what the prune does
Black on black crime resent the shooter
Bitch with a grip of my fingertip
And aim it right at that copper
Just locked up my partner
... They can't stop us
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I just wanna grab that heater
Run right in the cathedral
Aim it right at that preacher
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I just wanna take that banger
And aim it right at my Maker
I can't even trust my neighbor
I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one
Let's rest in peace up on the LB like Nate did
Bum house on Skid Row ain't this potent
Yeah you heard me right
You'd have this music down to a tee if you was me
And watch us pop across the population
At least I think so I can't quite remember where we are
I don't know if I'm on the red carpet or on Mars
I wanna see hands and white flags no matter if you teach
Eighth grade and you move weight like a gastric bypass
Of Independence and you can bet my John Hancock
I got seven hundred dollars from my last show
And I would spend it all on you
So baby won't you fall on through
Empathy... Empathy...
Empathy... Empathy...
It's been a little while since the last time I saw you
I hope everything is all cool
Empathy... Empathy...
Empathy... Empathy...
Empathy... Empathy...
Lady if you would just give me the time
You could just leave all your problems behind
Pamper you and stand for you
I guess things ain't going as well as you expected
Empathy... Empathy...
Empathy... Empathy...
I tell you I've been down that road before
If anyone can fill you then it's me
So why don't you let you garments hit the floor
And let me let you feel me
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
You ain't never seen a lime of light
I might fuck around and do a line tonight
You know I got it if you want
But I'm headed to the function
This shit ain't about nothing
No this shit ain't about nothing
But it's gotta be something
They say I'm so selfish
I ain't think about nothing
Unless it's making me something
Matter fact fuck that
I ain't worried about nothing
It's always something
It's always something
It's always something
It's always something
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
We in the world of material vixens in your videos
And I couldn't tell you how the world function
But I'm headed to the function
This shit ain't about nothing
No that shit ain't about nothing
But it's gotta be something
They say I'm so selfish
I ain't think about nothing
Unless it's making me something
Matter fact fuck that
I ain't worried about nothing
My only fear is fear itself
These are the days of our lives
I just wish they all could see what I can see
All I see is confusion and chaos
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
I'm tired of being broke and even worse
The upper class acts like they want me off this earth
That's only if you a coward and you're sure to get devoured
You could be the victor in a situation
Pardon my immortality
I'm Martin Luther shooting back on the balcony
If it takes me to be a martyr to push the envelope farther
I gladly sacrifice what is perceived
But I advise y'all to keep me alive
We travel the seven seas in hopes for a little peace
Your momma told me read the Book of Job
I came into this hurtful Earth in perfect health
And I even lost my lip skin
Grew back darker than its original pigment
Skin disfigured from boils and blisters
Unidentifiable by my little sister
My first years of Junior High School were not alright
I mean not even you. we eventually got cool
I'm glad I got to watch the woman that you blossomed too
Ironic we always had the same classes
Probably wouldn't have graduated had you not
Got deeper in this rap and started pushing shit back
Could've spent every minute with you but I had to get it
I know it was hard but you stayed down
We knew the only way to make it work was work together
It was supposed to end with our grandkids
Luckily for me I'm used to being cut short
Guess you needed your angel face for all of heaven to see
Your picture still on my mirror and it's so scary
I swear I still ain't looked at your obituary
So now I'm so doped up I think I'm flying
I guess the Mayans wasn't lying
You used to say that I could see the future
And I was just with you the day before
If reincarnation is true and we don't get too lost
Even if you forget me and everything you left behind
I close my eyes and I can still hear you singing loud
We never got to tell them who The Love Religion was about
Everything I love the most get taken away
My momma and music is next
And if that happens before I turn 28
Then I'm going out with Kurt Cobain
But if you really wanna look at it that way
I refuse to believe that
Now I'm on TV and on the radio
Don't be dethroned by these systems of control
Just keep your fingers crossed and get them locks off your soul
Don't be dethroned by these systems of control
Just keep your fingers crossed and get them locks off your soul
Gimme room like a Motel 6 or meet your doom
The dick make your chick jaw drop Ma catch your face
The game is all ours like violent movies
Everything I say is real
Got a few jewels in high places you know the deal
Your run is over like the Oprah show walk it out
They say I'm really out my mind mane
All do is get high and play mind games
This is my game I paid off the referee
Been fouled since I was born like Jeffery
The only MC with telepathy
I swear to God it won't be long
I'm just a demon that means well
I can hear myself good now
This is how it is These Days
You even lose when you win These Days
This is how it is These Days
You even lose when you win These Days
You even lose when you win These Days
Got your lady with literature under her Louis bag
Got your kid studying outside of class
Yeah that's how it goes
I'm just stacking paper get yours up
That's my word I got shows booked
This is how it is These Days
You even lose when you win These Days
You even lose when you win These Days
I just wanna live like the trees
But I'm about to go on tour
Suck my third leg while I branch out
But this money got me on the run
Rap like I go to church with work in the trunk
Used to cop a little deuce
Plenty empty Backwood packs in your face
But I'm interested in photosynthesis
But this money got me on the run
It's still world domination
But we called it the third eye when it could really be the first
I took it to heights these parasites can't see
Your cardiovascular isn't fast enough
I feel like I know my Soul purpose
No to consolidate hoping those listening
People treat you real nice when you got fifty dollar drawers on
Can't remember what I did last night
Fuck what I did last night
You can have my ho but don't hit my dough
I love foreign tits and her clitoris
Beat the pussy down like my nemesis
Bought a new bitch and a new house like
Can't remember what I did last night
Fuck what I did last night
I had a dub sack in my bucket
Kick game like Martial Arts kick game like Marshall Law
That like to do them nasty things you know I like them nasty things
I had a dub sack in my bucket
Oh God showed off inventing me
Me and K with the promoter
I'm unraveling backwoods
Except this time I'm old
Had that Chevy celebrity the same age as me
I had a dub sack in my bucket
We gave y'all plenty time to dig our stuff
Getting women in the mood
We tell the truth up in the nude
All I do is what you wouldn't think to do
Treat the damn booth like a urinal
I had a dub sack in my bucket
I had a dub sack in my bucket
I just might be in yo hood
I just might be in yo hood
I just might be in yo hood
I just might be in yo hood
Literally the face of my hood
So basically I beat the case
These days I'm so focused
These days I'm so focused
Or maybe I'm just a dreamer
And life is but a dream
And I would never leave her
But I bet she can't wait to get rid of me
And you can take your time on your own time I be at the finish line waiting
When doves cry shit get serious
Scheme turned dream turned nightmare on Elm Street
Ye ain't got your heart in the right place
You don't need no sleep
Or maybe I'm just a dreamer
And life is but a dream
And I would never leave her
But I bet she can't wait to get rid of me
And you can take your time on your own time I be at the finish line waiting
Can't spell Illuminati without Lu can't spell Lu without you
Can't spill blood without blue now ask yourself what is what I do
Built a time machine in my past like
Maybe like cookies to a monster
Or maybe I'm just a dreamer
And life is but a dream
And I would never leave her
But I bet she can't wait to get rid of me
And you can take your time on your own time I be at the finish line waiting
You could tell he was tripping by the look on his face
No new jacks in my city
Tell me something I don't know
I'm the one to blame for fucking up the frame of mind
The mini mimes but might I mind you these are minor things
My aim is to ill instill in the powers that be
Pretend if every tale you are not dreaming
If he don't leave you no option
Tell me something I don't know
Three bands on my shades
I'm riding round with that nine
We don't know what that bout
Master key to these bitches
Fuck most of these bitches
Checking athlete figures
Tell me something I don't know
See I ain't fucking with you man if you ain't paying me
Double cross the squad and get popped like Cracker Jacks
You see the look in my eyes so you know I'm strapped
I pulled up to the function with the pack
Turkey bag full of that gas
I don't even know where I'm at
I just got home boy I'm glad I made it
The Codeine got me activated
And now on a mission just to get some cheeks
And I'm back on the road sipping mud again
Turkey bag full of that gas
I don't even know where I'm at
This ain't Arabian night but let me see your camel toe
I might even set up my camera too
And all they say is yes when everybody know your name
Got a pack of Jet fuel that they don't use for planes
Unless it's a metaphor for how high I'm remaining
Along with a couple other things I shouldn't be naming
Turkey bag full of that gas
I don't even know where I'm at
Smells like dope in here
Don't let drugs do you
Smells like dope in here
Miming like Morpheus foresaw me saving Zion
I close my eyes and follow beetles in strawberry fields
And that one ho was getting grooved in the next room
That's a colorful touch like homosexual hugs
When I cross the street I look both ways
I just wanna teach you all about the mind
It makes sense I take interest in the third eye
Katrina cleared my absences so I could walk the stage
That's why I gotta make it count when they pay admission
And this is what he said
When I cross the street I look both ways
I'm a friend of a rapper
I'm from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania
These days I've seen my best
Need be lay me to rest
These days I've seen my best
Need be lay me to rest
These days I've seen my best
Need be lay me to rest
I left these holes in my hand just so you know who I am
So many styles I write with a ghost
Tree by the elbow we get for the LO
I'm popping downers to deal with depression
Smoking dope with the hitters
These days I've seen my best
Need be lay me to rest
These days I've seen my best
Need be lay me to rest
These Days ain't shit changed
These Days I'm a little more focused cause y'all cracked the door
I seen a dead body at five and that shit made me traumatized
It's only truth that this shit was meant to be
Life's in a traffic jam
I'm obviously ominous to my competition and if
Laughing at the scraps they offered us in the past
I had my ups and downs but I always left right
I watch this fire that we're gathered around and see
I called you back I'm glad you didn't answer baby
You spoke the truth into existence to degrade yourself
Told me keep it G as if you told yourself
Knew that I was on the move
I got to prove my theories to be true
I know it's getting hard to think about me
I know it's hard to see me on the TV
I know you wish you never met me
I liked you better when you didn't like me
Things just ain't the same no more
Things just ain't the same no more
Still think about you everyday
And I wish I could stay
But things just ain't the same no more
Lord knows you had the right care
I wonder if you still praying to the East
I wonder if you ever forgave me
I know it's getting hard to think about me
I know it's hard to see me on the TV
I know you wish you never met me
I liked you better when you didn't like me
Things just ain't the same no more
Things just ain't the same no more
Still think about you everyday
And I wish I could stay
But things just ain't the same no more
I know I said it'll be just one time
But it felt so good that I came back twice
And I take full blame
But in this world of selfish men
You keep your heart inside your chest
Let me fuck your mind
Greatest of all time Like Mike
Let me fuck your mind
Dumb as ditch but they'll still school you
Make you happy but fuck you like he mad at you
Let me fuck your mind
You took my grandpa job and you gave me a job
Not just a physical but digital way of displaying my rhymes
And making these kind people pay a fine
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses
Here to bring you a variety mix
And you shaking in your ballet shoes
On the four wheeler shredding up the sand dunes
There's something wrong and that's quite clear
I smell deception in the night's air
That shit is sweeter than a ripe pear
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses
Now I spread my wings and let the bird of dawning sing its song
And when my grandpa died I broke down and cried
Sweetest still is pain amongst all of the thriller things
One of these days some simple soul will pick up the Book of God
Let me start off with this statement
I'm the motherfucking greatest
I ain't even have too many haters
I'm rolling up in the tour bus
Just rolling up in the tour bus
Free said put the weed out they don't play that in Virginia
Couldn't find a fire but this far from home
Man this shit pays hanging in the house of fame
Now we sipping champagne on the motherfucking plane
Make your girlfriend cry when she see me walk by
Got the massage she feel me and them paparazzi feel me
Man this shit pays hanging in the house of fame
Now we sipping champagne on the motherfucking plane
Make your girlfriend cry when she see me walk by
I'm feeling fine and dandy
Man this shit pays hanging in the house of fame
Now we sipping champagne on the motherfucking plane
Make your girlfriend cry when she see me walk by
And I'm sitting down and
That's right make it spooky and shit
In time you'll find that I'm a fossil
You made a few bucks now you feel buck
I can do this with a blindfold
This ain't rap this is find a mine in your mind blow
It gets cold on the road to the riches
The cars and the clothes is expensive
These hoes with the nose in my business
In time you'll find that I'm a fossil
Pushing pennies but see a threes a 16 in my sport
Figure me I'm filthy I know it's greedy out here
On the surface I will certainly scratch
Imagine what we could do with a flick of the wrist
The cameras gone so bring the acid tabs along
It gets cold on the road to the riches
The cars and the clothes is expensive
These hoes with the nose in my business
In time you'll find that I'm a fossil
Pulling up no headlights but there's red beams on you
Apostle smoking on this dope my brain colossal
Hopes of the flow to do tricks like a brothel
Roll the lace with Angel Dust and pages of the bible
Call your number like you just won the raffle
Turn you into vegetables fill the dropped the celery
With the hand of Satan cause you need some sanitation
I must be Captain Phillips
That it's a lot more than marijuana in her son
All these lines add up like a motherfucking graph
So here's a question that I ask
Put my dick in witches from the Crucible
Loaded gun in front of me
Out there man talk about the potency of my pack
Satan's blood in my swash
I tell you that your life will be no longer than a
Cross me like the gold you wear
Every beverage with Codeine in it
I'm still taking blows at the Senate
And I just might be in your hood
I kinda really wanna use music to help people get through their days
That experience and try to move forward
A date is a day that's marked
I'm expecting Day to base his verse on data based on turds
The baseball is what we do best
I stand behind these bars for the rest of my life
I will never see the light of day again
Now witnessing this rare occasion I bear fruits of my labor this grape is green
I gotta eat on the go Day
There was a fool who thought we was new to this
That's light in a box
Seems he forgot what the C meant
In fact it's crazy that you even play ball to clear your thoughts before raw backwards
It's safe to say your mob of dots won't make it
But it won't take too many seconds to leave you in a damn urn
You deserve this disservice
So all them antics and funny shit you do for the cameras don't get aired here
That's what happens when you expose them grapes to too much daylight
Much smaller than my plan to defeat you
Till he's cropped out
You ain't gotta be in a Walgreen's pharmacy
To see quill drug over the counter
I should be against the law to run into
Today is the day I split Day in two
Somebody get Quill a quilt before Quill get kilt
That's why I'm ahead to day
I see I should have used the lighter instead
We need the fire instead
Take this 500 before you clap this shit up
And I hate that we have to
Hear the lies from this little light of mine that tried
They come up with this perfectly clean round
But I guess it's up to you to risk your career
To even the odds some
Either you fight back or I Ether you
Night slow guiders with both sirens
You said you would fry Day previously
But I tell them tails we never tuck
I from the Watts block for decision
It's funny how we're all in here but bro don't listen
Objects that I process is parallel
Let's get this aligned
Y'all see I got the drop on everybody
That's why I reign superior
You did say you were Friday
But you don't realize you're on the weak end to the streets
But you got the roots stirred up
Based on whether you got the drive
You can't back up defeat but I try to get up the hill
I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
Bloodthirsty for the money like a bull
I'm scared to death that he stops me
Heart beating so loud you can hear the echo in that lobby
And see I'm breaking down if I don't make it out
Then I'm leaving town with that contract
His chair and I'm taking him hostage
What they don't know is there is a gun in the paint can
If I could get signed my life is destined
My future depends on ink
And secretary at the front of the entrance staring right at me
I walk up she whispers go ahead and then gives me a wink
I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
Thought it would be shiny and beautiful
Thought it would be alive and like musical
There's numbers on a chalkboard
Graphic designers are sitting around
Waiting for albums that never come out
This was my chance to grab that contract and turn and jet
Right then felt a cold hand grab on the back of my neck
Your music gets so impressive in this whole brand you created
And with that right song we all know that you're next to be famous
After your album comes out we'll need back that money that you borrowed
Along with a third of the money you make when you're out doing your shows
I move my ass to Cali with my Indiana bucket
They call my shit a scraper and the beta bitches love it
And I'm choking on some Cali good
I was overdue for a visit
A valley bitch with family in the Chi gave me digits
All my hoes from way back want me to be chilling where they at
Shout out to the blocks
When I am gone just know that I owe you
When I am gone just know that I owe you
Cause now I'm the king to music to all y'all
Where you learn to survive and keep your head high
And if that tech jammed you better have a toast too
For the mail I'm going postal
I heard the baddest females on pacific coastal
When I am gone just know that I owe you
When I am gone just know that I owe you
Too much pride to let this pussy industry play me out
Been 20 years since the riots
Bitch it's on in this war zone where we reside
As I begin let my sins wash away with the tides
When I am gone just know that I owe you
Of my city fuck with me juggle shots through ya jugular
Burn ya whole block down like propane
These streets ain't no motherfucking joke
Hard rock or pure blow
I can show you how to whip it
Birdies given off a show
Remedy for meal tickets
Snitched on by known cowards
Murders keep me stressed at night
Burn ya whole block down like propane
These streets ain't no motherfucking joke
Know I gotta hold it down
Know I gotta run my town
Know tomorrows never promised
Know I gotta get it now
Know I got a job to finish
Know I need stock to grow
Know I need Lord's forgiveness
Know I've been through obstacles
Know the drama that it brings
Know I can't trust these hoes
Know I can't chase these bitches
Know I gotta chase this bread
Know I gotta push these trucks
Know I gotta paint these pictures
Know I gotta give it up
Know you better mind your business
Know I gotta stay silent
Know I can't fall for nothing
Know I know hard times
Know I gotta stay humble
Know you gotta come and get me
Know you can't fuck with me
Burn ya whole block down like propane
My teachers used to call my mama on me
Like Pocahontas daddy
But really though I just need a hater
Boxed in that Porsche box like I'm fighting south paw
And my eyes low and I drive slow like Paul Wall
Married to the game at the alter wasted
A pound of white rice on the tribe of Asians
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
I've got some folks in low end
I got a bitch but she know
Her friends done did the Dino
That's that Chicago lingo
My dick won't even call her
That's why I stay on petty
I know that bangers jam
That's why my hands stay ready
Lean all on the square
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
That's that youngster rapper
Wrap that blunt under after
Smoke all out the window
Cops could eat a dick
If you ain't the hitter
You just might be the lick
She like when I rap raps
But better when I sing songs
Tell shorty I may change
And I made it and I napalm
Drugs while on the clock
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
She was a phony goalie
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
Round and round we go
What's the difference
Have you seen the ground
Mountains and valleys
Ego removed but still in tune exactly
Third eye winking at me
I glimpse with a squint
But I can see a whole grip
My way to this sedated state of mind I always dread
This is the state of mind I always had
I'm mad he died before we got to have a man to man
I got two packs of sweet aromatics and 14 grams
So I take a deep breath
I'm just a product of my past
I show you how to let your soul sail
Might of got way too high
My Baby is a hero no matter what he shows
I know he goes to trouble
Fighting in this jungle
From one failure to the next
When he stares into space
I know he goes to trouble
Fighting in this jungle
My life without him will be meaningless
My Baby is a hero no matter what he shows
I know he goes to trouble
Fighting in this jungle
From one failure to the next
When he stares into space
I know he goes to trouble
Fighting in this jungle
My life without him will be meaningless
My Baby is a hero no matter what he shows
I know he goes to trouble
Fighting in this jungle
From one failure to the next
When he stares into space
I know he goes to trouble
Fighting in this jungle
But we're going strong
But we're going strong
We'll going on and on
We'll going on and on
But we're going strong
But we're going strong
We'll going on and on
We'll going on and on
But we're going strong
But we're going strong
We'll going on and on
We'll going on and on
But we're going strong
But we're going strong
We'll going on and on
Traveling miles and miles from home
Blood still stains the ground we walked
Soaking into the roots of trees
Giving strength to mother earth
This land is not their land
Head held high above the torment
Hear the hearts of our lost warriors
Beating to the pounding drum
This ground was once ours
Now a wasteland of destruction
Polluting the waters we drink
Polluting the air we breathe
Forced in the corner suffocating
Outcasts grouping for the next to ride
Tellers of the future speaking of the new beginning
One warrior will rise to defend against this place
Thousands of souls giving him power
Anybody kills until the future is fulfilled
Through darkness light shines under the rain from the diamonds
Showering upon the same roots
Roots that we shared with blood
Let those roots bring the tree
Clean get away keeping my dirty pockets fatter
Smooth operation plans well thought out
Hands in the air is what I'm talking about
The one crazy native representing Psychopathic
Down for the D cause the D is where I struggle
40 sipping bullets filling the sky
Bulletproof preventing you from popping me
Unless your targets on my face don't think to call yourself a G
Bitch I'll kill you for your necklace
3 bullets enter into the automobile
Now I'm peeling out down the alleyway
That makes you wanna scream and shout and rip his motherfucking soul out
Stab you in the side with a machete blade
So if you stepping better kill me or you fucking die
My teacher always said I wouldn't be nothing
Sometimes I feel like a nut
Running through the neighborhood tearing shit up
Sometimes I feel that my head fucked up
Now I'm addicted to the sound of a head getting whacked
Turn my headphones up
Sandwich bag filled up but you ain't got enough
Me and J steady smoking pounds
So at least have a sack when you see us around
Like you ain't heard man we flipping the scripts
When I pass it to you bitch pass it back
Because y'all know how we spark a lot
And when we all get together we see diamond mist
I like it cause it fuck with my head
And without it you fucks would be dead
I rhyme dead and head for the 17th time
If I loved Shaggy anymore I'd have to be gay
I'm fat and fuzzy and I smell like weed everywhere
Ghetto scrubs flipping nubs at thugs
I'm trying to say anything that rhymes
I'm in the water with the sharks bleeding
We buying out the bar we don't dance with them
So if you ever get a chance to glance at them
Yes that's what the hell we are
Chinese secrets making wine from rice
Still shoot dice up against the wall
Think twice like the 3 blind mice
But don't give me no advice
I shine like crystals in the jewelry heist
They know me up in valet parking
I'm ready bring all these hoes
So I'm asking for the pussy right up on the spot
We'll head upstairs and I'll give it a stab
She took her panties off and the door shut behind me
Her panties were scary though I will admit
Just to get my fucking nub up inside her
Bend her legs back and used a wood chipper
Shaved the first half down and quickly flipped her
I'm rocking a lumpy Indian witch doctor condom
It might blow my ass up but wouldn't scratch my dick
Fucking this bitch was like fucking Anna Nicole Smith
I pulled the snappy off and I aimed for her chest
The only ghost she had right about then
Was the mysterious white orbs I left on her chin
That night I'm sleeping giving the dick rest
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts
Sounds bumping all night steadily waking you up
Every week another piece of property getting stolen
Checking in you little buster watch your eye get swollen
Ever since the young age of 13
For all them cars that got stolen
The windows that got broken
A handful of jewelry that the cops caught me holding
I never been caught for a crime that I committed
I never seen a fat ass lick and didn't hit it
All the murders that they claiming I ain't stressing that shit
Cars and stray dogs always fucking up my grass
And every time you see me coming you know I'm about to ask
And fucking bitch at Burger King just to get some free snacks
Standing on my porch in a robe
My eye catch and running pockets like a campaign rep is getting snatched
Dice game on the side of the crib
I keep it ghetto like the whitest of trash
So when you see me on your block watch your back
Know you hate to share it I love it when I'm scaring the
Climbing all them racist holes
There go the neighborhood
Because the native hydro keeps changing me.
Come and play with me...
And get your own fucking bullshit schemes.
Come and play with me...
But you talking from the door so come out and play...
Come and play with me...
Come and play with me...
These hatchet men up on our chest...
These hatchet men up on our chest...
These hatchet men up on our chest...
These hatchet men up on our chest...
Let it be known that yous a hater and you just full of shit
Detroit east side 7 mile is where we'll meet
You'd be surprised what hood rats would do for crack
Cause why the fuck would you want to be up in my business
You just probably never liked me from the start
And offer no apologies
And don't try banning me
How can it be uncannily
Like my name's the only reason at I act this way
Cause it just might be the last thing that you have left
Tell your family eat a dick I hope they whole crew die
Cause all the enemies I have are pretty much deceased
And offer no apologies
And don't try banning me
How can it be uncannily
And I hope to all the haters that this shit is spread
If you ever started hating me just fall off the earth
Because the soul your body carries really has no worth
Or is it jokes the stuff you hate that's why your stomach in knots
Always feeling left out cause you don't fit in
So you spread around this anger and don't act like a friend
But the town will only tell how much your hatreds grown
And offer no apologies
And offer no apologies
And offer no apologies
And don't try banning me
Taking every damn thing in sight that's worth
Put me in a hole baby 6 feet deep
I've survived this long with a microphone
Left hand on my nuts right gripping a piece
So now I feel that I owe it to y'all
You're the reason that I'm here instead of dead and gone
And don't think that I'm here to stress you out
I just wanna let you know what I'm about
These are all the things that a G brings
Wait a minute let me tell the truth
Walk away just keeping my cool
Like I'm sneaking in line at a big venue
That's what the fuck I've been trying to say
Me and my whole damn family acting murderous ways
That's why we only gather once a year
Because the world really can't afford to disappear
So now we all break bread never misled
And the drama that I bring you will never forget
And the ones that's down no matter where you're at
I'm just here to let you know that I got your back
These are all the things that a G brings
Shove the pistol in your mouth slightly quicker than some
Drag bodies into coffins by they bitch ass shoulders
You see me packing a gun in the vest
Ain't no way ain't anybody gonna stop my shine
These are all the things that a G brings
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray my dreams don't slowly creep
Caught up in a web with no escape
Something the mind can't break unless you wide awake
Then woke up in the morning and forgot it was there
But you sit back and act like you never knew
The same situation happened in my life
Mixed emotions caused from stress
That reunite when you lay your head down to rest
It's like creatures of the night leaving nothing but bad news
And things about the future that might make you confused
I remember way back in the day
At the age of 13 before moms passed away
The dreams that I had people said weren't right
Like the evilness of afterlife lurking in the night
To another life where it's safer than this
Not a dream but reality I hope for this wish
But it never came true so I'm stuck in this place
Just a native acting crazy that keeps changing his face
Searching for the final answer so I can spread the word
Now that you really see me I'm just asking to be heard
We all in this together so they call us night crawlers
Think the worlds feeling weary because we getting smarter
Can't sleep at night cause the spirits won't allow ya
Blessed with the wisdom that you see in my eyes
Don't be surprised if you ever think you caught up inside
That keeps you jumping up in shivers from ice cold breath
Now you swear you're being followed every time that you rest
Or you feel sharp pains drilling deep in your chest
I don't expect anyone to believe if they don't want to
But don't expect yourself to rest in peace if spirits haunt you
Make your choice people dream it or not
It's time to look into the situation we got
Release all the stress before the world becomes a stranger
Medicine man above your headboard with a dream catcher
So love a dinosaur that you can't tame
This how it is and I ain't changing for shit
I'm sick and tired of fucking waiting for you wanna be
Sniffing lines of gunpowder to start off the night
And had to grab a shank and slit a throat up
The types of shit most people call unreal
With the empty fucking wallet so there's so much to gain
Turn my back and let my hollow points drill into you
Don't get it in your head that I would never hurt you
Cause the ones that getting shot are the ones that deserve to
First off let me speak
There's some crazy motherfuckers I've been dying to teach
About the ways of the underground
How it's been around and around by adding those terrifying sounds
We go way from the east to the west
But it sounds so familiar
Busting caps at the strays with the rusty ass throw away
If you're scared turn the lights on
I can see your heart steady pounding though I bet it won't last long
A little something that I thought you should know
If not well it goes like this
Away from the sun cause it hurts my eyes
Been such an outcast in so many ways
Now it's time to clean my head out make you all amazed
Words that I speak leave your ears infected
No need for bodyguards I'm my own protection
There's only 2 things that I need
To much dirt that I can't speak
I'll put my kids on it
Teeth bang on the streets serving heads all night
Some of us just ain't living right
I know this stupid bitch who think she know me
Stank hoes wanna see me in the grave
And saying things you know he's acting like something changed
Yeah I'm in the house
Teeth bang on the streets serving heads all night
Some of us just ain't living right
If you keep talking shit you gonna end up in my trunk
Robbing hoes for they gold then trade it in for a sack
Don't even think for a second that we high class
40 drinking freaks with some dank and a nice ass
Then punch you right in the throat
Type of shit that most people call a little fucked
Teeth bang on the streets serving heads all night
Some of us just ain't living right
Dogs with no bite that wanna bark
And I'll slap you with a bat like a G should
If you beer bottle then I really wanna smash it
Selling weed filled with stems and seeds
Now that's the kinda shit that makes the mind go crazy
2 packs of Ports a day and I just can't take it
I swear if one more hero tries to flex in my face
Teeth bang on the streets serving heads all night
Now if you got your hat tilted to the side
And you're always down to jack a bitch for her ride
Never once been seen alone
Ever since you can remember you was fully grown
Slanging rocks on the block
With a knot in your sock
Robbery and selling trees the only jobs that you held
Been to more damn funerals than the reverend himself
With no thought of graduation or a fucking degree
Still clocking cheese from what you learned on the streets
I'm always asked if I'm gang related
By police and the public and I'm starting to hate it
Willing to die for everything that we built
The battleground we call turf where haters come to be killed
When you participate in gang related activities
But I wouldn't trust him as far as I can throw him
Right now he's chewing holes in the floor here at the studio
I don't even wanna do this
But he asked me to and I'm scared of his pistol whips
We're all sick in the hatchet's hatchery
Somewhere out on that horizon
Out beyond the neon lights
I know there must be something better
But there's nowhere else in sight
It's survival in the city
When you live from day to day
City streets don't have much pity
I was born here in the city
With my back against the wall
No one's there to catch you when you fall
Somewhere out on that horizon
Far away from the neon sky
I know there must be something better
And I can't stay another night
That he has written all these messages himself.
So now that I've told you all...
That's the thing about
Cool... now help me open it
I'm a crazy motherfucker with pride
And I got enough wisdom to keep my soul alive
They always just stop and stare
Like I don't belong in this place
So they say that it's not fair
I can't understand this drama
That the Earth brings down on me
So let me take you through my mind
And drop these bombs on you
And drop these bombs on you
I'm gonna tell you why I'm dropping bombs
Soft motherfuckers standing on the stage boasting
Now don't expect me to just walk away
Because I've been told y'all that I'm here to stay
Because it's time to represent and watch these warriors grow
I can't understand this drama
That the Earth brings down on me
So let me take you through my mind
And drop these bombs on you
Mop up the floor with that bullshit
To take care of me and mine
See me in the streets if ya wanna talk about it
These days I got nothing but time
So I'm gonna use it all to chase down what's mine
And the only thing hard is that shit you talk
You ever seen a redskin get tipsy
Then take it to the old school 1850
Arrow stuck in the back of ya neck
Just because ya mama raised you to disrespect
New game means whole new rules
And I guarantee y'all that I will not lose
I guess I'm gonna take ya back to my roots
Warriors stand up and let's get these fools
Don't let no one get ya
All I do is roll state to state
So I can look into the eyes of those who relate
We gonna make it more hype than the night before
Just a bit more out of control
So learn to live a little and watch your life grow
Don't mean to steer you wrong
Cause second chances don't come that quick
Don't let no one get ya
Come stick and move with me
Right through the industry
Come stick and move with me
Let's say this was a game of tag
Even though I stick and move through the industry
We should all represent our race
Is staring you right in your face
Underneath the concrete
It's like two Hannibal cannibals and one biscuit
Who's to blame that my parents hated me
Seems like I was there for years
Might not be all right
In these sewers and pipes
Sometimes the tunnels get so small
I can see up ladies skirts
Come and visit us I know it's somewhere that you wanna be
This place is still home to me
Might not be all right
In these sewers and pipes
It's always nighttime
And which ones are the newest
And which ones be some underground transit movers
I ran for the fridge and grabbed everything I could
And then dove in through the kitchen sink
Just a big hole with nothing in the middle
Beaming through the sewer hole lids of the streets
Might not be all right
In these sewers and pipes
Leave your whole damn neighborhood stunned
Three little holes in the back of ya dome
Clothes on my back be dirty laundry
I'm dusty like a ashtray
Got a clean ass piece though
When it's all about to go down
I bring that old school basement sound
Little redskin homey in the hood
Especially how cheap you was on the chronic sack
CD burned full of old school tracks
If this is something that you normally see
Then you probably live close to me
There was a party at the liquor store
There was a party at the liquor store
There was a party at the liquor store
Or they dream about sex and those in birthday clothes
There was a party at the liquor store
There was a party at the liquor store
There was a party at the liquor store
So I rolled up a blunt of that chocolate tie
Walk in to grab a 40 as I spark my stuff
Went straight to the back where the brew be at
Grabbed a cold 4-0 and proceeded to crack
Gotta dollar fifty sub and a bag of Better Made chips
Phone number from the hot bottle return bitch
There was a robbery at the liquor store
There was a robbery at the liquor store
There was a robbery at the liquor store
Way back before we walked the earth
It was so much cleaner cause it wasn't disturbed
Everybody gotta watch they back
Everybody gotta walk in they own path
Ever since there's been a jail cell
Murder's been committed
Punished for the life they took with no grudge
There's a whole lot of states allowed to fry your brains
That's cause lately we just burn it away
Let them build they own prisons where their ass can stay
It's a wonder how we let things happen
Bad choices lead to a terrible afterlife
Everybody gotta watch they back
Everybody gotta walk in they own path
Things that's gonna get ya down and out
There just things I had to get up off my chest
Everybody gotta watch they back
Everybody gotta walk in they own path
Now you got me after you
Devious and beady eyes
Quick to jump and take your life
Put you on a permanent vacation
For loose river dance
Have you all hemmed up like
We bigger than you thought
Call up all the fellas
We been known in the hood
I'm in the back with the windows cracked
Somebody on the side of me
Give me a second to shoot back
And got the hops on my lap
Steady trying to hide out in traffic
Go against me and you'll rest up in a bed
With a hole in the head
It ain't worth your life
And you just opened a trunk of some trouble
You ain't never gonna be the same again
K chopped your legs from knee down
Get touched back with force
We don't sleep at all
Everybody in your crew is sure to fall
You get a rusty shovel all up in your neck
Use the same weapon to bury that ass in the ground
Don't be staring like you gonna do shit
Without your weapon and your mouth
My crew gets pissed the fuck off
At all these mediocre thugs
People chase after Death everyday
And don't even realize
I ran through the trees and the woods
Ya really got to feel this
But look deeper into yourself and prove your own existence
Because the hate we try to stop all began with me
But when you at Death's door we gonna see what you got
Standing up on that platform
Mad as hell cause you was never well informed
I guarantee you're gonna wanna come back
With a whole new life that's so compact
I ran through the trees and the woods
No one would ever understand
But I guess that was the plan
So I guess I'm gonna try and relax
And only lay down straight up facts
Is there anyone out there that sees what I see
I ran through the trees and the woods
Ya never know how much time is left
Sure glad I can depend on y'all
So I swear to the earth I'll never let ya doubt
I'm told everywhere I go
That I'm held cause of my technique
Cause these words are deep that I speak
I ran through the trees and the woods
And you never seen it coming
And you never seen it coming
And you never seen it coming
And you never seen it coming
And you never seen it coming
And you never seen it coming
I see right through you
Never will you step a foot around me again
Some of the people in this world is some straight up hoes
All up in your face in case ya wanna taste a hot one
I got no love for them marks
So stay away and don't come to close
I got too many mouths to feeds from kids to mothers
My wife and brothers and too many others
Gave your eyes chocolate donuts and bounced the fuck out
I go home and meditate with some sage
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
High school reunion wouldn't show my face
I was always looked at a little different
Even if I ain't do the shit
Until the day that I got my revenge
When they found one student stabbed to death with a pen
Gotta half day off cause of that bullshit
Let me take another victim see if I can get a whole day
They just found her in the hallway
Whole football team damn near laid to rest
I'm so glad this year's almost over
They'll look over the shoulder
Murder after murder all the way until I graduate
Never once was invited to a party
Ever since I got here
They treated me strange
They got me going crazy
To make all those around fear
Things you do don't amaze me
There's always something ten times better
To fit in a situation they don't understand
Confused and fed up and don't know what else to do
Until they get mad enough and come after you
But there's situations I won't understand until I'm older
It doesn't matter if my shotgun splatters your brain
Nothing matters where I'm from
Center of the earth with the worms and scum
All that drama that you bring with your mouth as a weapon
To try and keep my head straight
The more you think about me the sadder you're gonna get
It doesn't matter if my shotgun splatters your brain
I know that they don't like and it don't matter none
You can hear me lose a lung if you listen to the playback
It don't matter how I got here or where I come from
Fuck everybody who don't wanna hear me
Maybe it's what I say and portray is why they fear me
It doesn't matter if my shotgun splatters your brain
And I wouldn't give a damn if you hated me now
Because my family hears me out and bumps this shit out loud
So we just sit in the rain
Like respect from the cops on the curb at the concert
You better close your eyes
Smoke a blunt blunt in the forest while you piss in the lake
But it's a whole new year so try and stop me now
Back from what you really wanna do
Besides in this life all you got is you
Don't let go... go... go... So emotional
Its looking too peaceful up there on the top
Even if I gotta bust on the ones I can't trust
I put my life on my music and everything around me
So I decided way back in the day
It's been a long time since I got to sit up straight
Once I put my life on this
There's nothing left but my guarantee
Once I put my life on this
There's nothing left but my guarantee
I been in this game for so many years
I put my life on every word that I say
My guarantee is that I'm here to stay
Once I put my life on this
There's nothing left but my guarantee
Once I put my life on this
There's nothing left but my guarantee
Put your hands up if you're down for the struggle
That I put my whole life on what the fuck I achieve
Once I put my life on this
There's nothing left but my guarantee
Once I put my life on this
There's nothing left but my guarantee
I start to reminisce about my life and shit
Like how I came from the streets
Was raised by the streets
That's why I give love and I'll die for the streets
I really can't help how I feel
And I can give two fucks to know how to deal
That's why I'm fully equipped
I can't help all the things I do
I can't help if the words I speak cause pain
Stay away if you can't stand the heat
Brown paper bag wrapped around my drink
Say all those things you say
Too paranoid to pick up the phone
When every time I turn around I got to deal with fools
It's like I gotta bend all the rules
To try to take what's mine even if I lose
It's ain't my fault that I was raised this way
Never meant to cause you pain
Only thing that I could say is
Do I really wanna see so clear
Even though I know bad things might appear
Tell me that it's not a waste of time
To ride around and stare up here to try and clear my mind
Plus the sound of the drum from the wind felt good
Don't act like my soul ain't concerned
If I see you all another day
I'm writing this as if it was my last
Thank you for the memories and times we had
2 Whom This May Concern
Remember me as if I never went away
Because I see you all another day
2 Whom This May Concern
Cut down trees just to clear a path
Try to show y'all wrong from right
A down state of mind means too uptight
Graduated from the streets of Ghetto University
Most people can't deal with this
I'm writing this as if it was my last
Thank you for the memories and times we had
2 Whom This May Concern
Remember me as if I never went away
Because I see you all another day
2 Whom This May Concern
For all the suicidal things I did
All the pain that was caused to achieve a wish
Can't wash away what's not seen
Guess we all gotta little dirty history
Don't know which way to go
Time to pick up the pace and let the whole world know
I'm writing this as if it was my last
Thank you for the memories and times we had
2 Whom This May Concern
Remember me as if I never went away
Because I see you all another day
2 Whom This May Concern
As these words are turning I keep thinking this will never end.
At times I get lonely and I need someone to confide in.
Always under pressure and I never take time to relax.
Sometimes I just wish I could collapse.
But then I'd miss you.
I try to focus and just handle things that come my way.
Maintain my emotions if I don't then I'll be sure to fall.
I'm always out of control
Steady moving this is how we roll
Only streets know where we go
The wheels on a bus go round and round
I guess I'll see you when I get there
Have it rolled up cause you know how I love them blunts
I got mad love from my people for my people
I didn't want to bother you or nothing
Just wanted to tell to keep doing what you're doing
I'm always out of control
Only streets know where we go
Back on the streets with a new release
You know this night has just begin
Don't be nervous just relax
Just here to entertain for you
Come and hang with me
I'll take you out to eat
I'm always out of control
Only streets know where we go
Nobody knows what I'm going to do next
Nobody knows what I'm going to do next
Nobody knows what I'm going to do next
Nobody knows what I'm going to do next
I can feel your souls been waiting to let all my spirits through
So many faces on my spin
All these legends that we speak
When lightening strikes on solid ground
But still you can't see me
Nobody knows what the fuck I'm after
Sometimes it feels like we've been driving all night
Hoping that the next city's got that good
So that I can get my nerves straight
And make my brain shake
Damn near everywhere I go
Damn near everywhere I go
Damn near everywhere I go
Damn near everywhere I go
All I know is that you better pay attention
So keep your eyes wide open
And look out for something weird
What this world is coming to
Let me set the world straight
Let me catch you in my path
Detroit Streets means take precaution
All this rage means I'm fed up
To the people on the streets with the murder mentality
Times in my life I could
Ain't no room for your folks
I'm yo Ghetto Neighbor
Representing for sure
There's a nation around the world
As I slip into character
Ain't no need to front
All alone in the closet
We are the Road Fools
And fat sacks to smoke
I mean state to state
Barbeque's in the parking lot
Tour bus truck stopped
Some lizards in the locks
Road fools heading out
Ain't no need to get pissed
Or the mall while I'm buying dress shoes for court
Because we all stand together with pride
Or the mall while I'm buying dress shoes for court
Because we all stand together with pride
I swing a hatchet like a warrior
Told you all the dirty history my life observed
Showed you how to keep rolling while you acting a fool
Now you want get all muddy cause you underground too
Don't be blinded by those mainstream raps
People get so emotional
Especially when you don't let them know
You see the love they show
All I know is that I pay mad dues
So respect what you getting
And if you feeling how I'm feeling
Then I'm doing it right
There is no history known not to have a trace of dirt on it
It's like a survival kit we rub on to keep unnoticed
Because I'm back in this bitch like your mom's ex boyfriend
All up in your face with some brand new nonsense
Rolling with a family the size of a typhoon
To pull my heat and lay you out or grab my blade and start to scalp
Either way I do not doubt the sweet revenge keeps me around
Everybody recognize I'm not the type to tell you twice
I be ticking like a time bomb ready to explode
Beside I ain't shot a stupid motherfucker all day
I've been waiting for the right time and this is it
Just another spirit jumping into the soul
What are you gonna do
Smacking y'all in the face with a laugh
Learn the history of these warriors because we may not last long
The silhouettes you see are just thoughts of me
Ready to open your mind and feed it energy
My microphone is like an eagle feather very extinct
Too hot to hold so don't even think about it
And I don't need to breathe faster than the blink of an eye
I guess that's why I'm so underground
I'm the type of motherfucker you can't stop
Especially those that make me mad
I be all in your face but hard to find
Underground living so this killer can hustle and grind
And every time we get together we wreck shit
I pay dues to make moves just like the next man
Some of y'all recognize real shit
While other are influenced and just take it like a bitch
So if you real with the words that you spill
There ain't no reason you should feel anything you do is ill
I got some courage in the heavy hitting heart beat
I got the attitude to survive in the streets
I got the wisdom of an old school cat
I got the nerve to go do whatever
Cause there really ain't too many out here doing it better
So when you see me keep one thing in mind
People hate me because my skin
Or the ways that I look at them
Sometimes swing all in they face
Or is ti because my flow
People hate me because they racist
If you are here I suggest you bounce
Unless you wanna see a tommy hawk split your mouth
Put that racist in his place
Get stopped by the cops
Your thoughts don't mean shit
Who do they think they are
Try to tell us how to dress
Well they can keep they balls
You put your hands up
Put your hand up and get down on the ground
This is some bull shit
Don't you know I'm on top
Wanted dead or alive by the world
Never once will you see tied down on the tracks in a knot
Now I'm ready to fight
If anybody wanna make it
Bring the move right on
At your funeral they will play this song
He lived life for love and good
Now he's dead and gone
How come people build up courage
To hate on someone else
That's why I keep it underground
It's time to be real y'all
It's time to be real y'all
I said it's time to be real y'all
Started off a bad ass
So read between the lines
I was brought up right
Guess you can say when you lose
It's all I've ever known
Couldn't nobody give me rules
Every now and then a jail cell
But what's that prove
I was addicted to all
Had to change and find a better way
Nowadays I got a strong mind
No need for safety nets
And put fear in those who's eyes just ain't right
Like they're on my shoulder
And I admit that it sure feels good
To finally get a chance to be understood
Made a lot of friends and I met a lot of fools
Everybody get a fist that the demand is hot so hit your mom and pop shop and get a supply
Worldwide I'm coming at you serving you up with the dose of the dope music having you
Mind I got the good shit that makes your legs twitch and tweak around the party when its on

Can't get enough so I'm giving you more I got the killer that you need when you ready to
Score ill have you up to the sunrise banging your head and make your momma wanna
To look around for the regular shit my music my musical Medicine helps calm the nerves
Have and you need a pick me up from the Medicine bag there's plenty to go around no
Press play on the disk and let the sound from the speakers full fill your wish
Hears a song that you play when you ain't feeling rite because its bad to be stressed out and
All up tight so I had to give you something to make you smile for the people who ain't did it in
Keep the party on the pumping till ya just pass out anyway you gotta do it don't bee held back
The Medicine that I'm giving is for you to relax
Rise up work hard for what you want its time to grind yo let mother fuckers know you coming
If I had one last chance to do things over in my life
I would be all right.
If I had just one last chance to tell you how I feel
For leaving here eternally.
I will tell you what you meant to me
If I had just one last chance to say
Because it take time.
And I'll be all right.
For everything I put you through
I would probably finally rest and peace
I would be all right.
I would be all right.
I would be all right.
That will be all that I need.
I would be all right.
The... of everything that's keeping the song...
I'll tell you that I miss you until the day I die.
My hearts beating rapidly and I'm losing my breathe
I'm kinda nervous but I know soon it'll all go away
Any journey that I travel I know that I'm a survive
Even though I'm used to it it still gets to me
But there's still no other place that I'd rather be
Shake the nerves off and pursue it
Time waits for no man so you can't renew it
When you build enough confidence to try it again
A second chance is the shit
If it's there my friend get it done the first time
You get a lot more respect if your willing to shine
And don't let nobody bring you down
Cause you gave it a shot
I'm kinda weak in the knees
It's so hard to just be patient when your ready like me
To try and concur every obstacle that's put in your face
And if your willing to take it on with style and grace
And you can bet your life
And just build my shine one day at a time
And stop being nervous
So don't even wave to me.
In other words I'm following my dreams.
Even if it seems a little strange.
So I'm here to make it and
Need to go out and achieve.
But the journey had just begun.
So I'm here to make it and
Need to go out and achieve.
But the journey had just begun.
The struggles we face.
Like a memory in your head just being erased.
Just to keep the lead.
Nobody gets in front of me.
The power that I feel
With no sight of friction.
Till you're all worn out.
Now I'm pushing all my energy into the galaxy.
Instead of looking deep into what's real in our eyes.
My mental evaluation says I need help
My mental evaluation says I need help
Don't come out until he's out of commission and I
Drive around looking where I can get to
I don't need no help from some unknown
My mental evaluation says I need help
My mental evaluation says I need help
I'm in the back seat of your car just waiting
So when I see you then I'll put it all behind me
You kept pushing but I would not budge
I'm street with it you might not come home that night
To turn me into a zombie with no thrill
My mental evaluation says I need help
My mental evaluation says I need help
With my anger so bad that I can need pain
Before I cause myself or someone else pain
With my anger so bad that I can need pain
My mental evaluation says I need help
My mental evaluation says I need help
My mental evaluation says I need help
Roll that blunt let's get fucked up
Just because I'm stumbling
I'm a warrior bitch recognize
Tomahawk in my hand moccasins on my feet
Pack the peace pipe Before I hit that strange
Pop on the deer buck skin rubber
Lay her down slow on my bear hide cover
Bitch is out for the count
Totem pole warrior from the 3 1 3
I know you wanna be a... Warrior
That's why I have all this crazy energy
Regal Beagle pow wow when my robe folds off
I know you wanna be a... Warrior
Get high stay high live high
And if you wanna go the way I go... die high
Spend his life behind bars they can't bring that thing
Mary Jane got us focused now she's wanted in hell
Stay true to the game think big
I split your whole fucking forehead open Rude Boy style
I keep it raunchy and funky
Like a dirty laundry pile
I turn heads like an explosion when I hit the door.
I can get pimply like pillow talk with love songs
Anyway that I can get up in that ass like a thong
I'm sipping shots of syrup straight to the dome
When she picked up the phone the back of her brains blown
Now that you're dead on gone
Representing black and red
Pointing fingers at my enemies
Native nuts get these
Have you ever heard the sound
Stare up at the moon hoe
Look at all the light
When you see some killers in sight
And it really don't matter what you think of me
I'm up in this bitch for free
And all I keep thinking is
I hope somebody brought a bag of weed
I like them flavored blunt wraps
So just pack a bowl for now
It's still a hatchet bitch
But my bracket bitch n
If you just can't deal with that
We be creeping without a sound
As the steering wheel turns around
Our ghost car drifting in and out the street lights
Wizards in the back who know the craft of street fights
As smoke is floating from window cracks
Demons without reason
Or the mercy we once knew
Revenge is like the sweetest joy
Microphone and weed fiend
Rapping with Cellophane
And I cut the head off the Devil
Nobody standing in the way
You better watch what you say
And strangle bitches quick as Shaggy 2 Dope
Before they find your head in a dumpster
I'm cruising down 7 Mile dirty as fuck
I got some fucking explosives
And pipe bombs in the truck
And I don't even know who that is
I'm tighter then a 2 door Escort
Packed with 7 fat kids
So tell your momma to fuck off
And I'm coming to dinner
You've got a hot bitch in the D
I probably had my dick up in her
Freaks and flowing on the microphone
And I'm still rapping with for the hatchet
Killer rolling the light green
So we can lace the cut up
And dub my shit to cassette
It's just the free studio
I got some dick for that
And you ain't coming back
Why don't you just take a look at my hatchet
That's right it's a fucking free studio
The motherfucking studio we own
Coming to you from Southwest
All the way to the East side
Something that you can't ignore
Come from behind closet doors
Look in my eyes and tell me more
Life is full of things in store
But dreams come true to those who soar
I'm just trying to stay alive
I'm just trying to stay alive
As I look into the future
Life and death chasing after me
Represent the underground
So I'm gonna flaunt it
A little dirt never hurt nobody
When shit gets spit buddy
Cause there's no time for coasting
But I can't so I won't
You tell me to get help
Crazy thoughts going on in my head
You better duck your head
I'm just trying to stay alive
I'm just trying to stay alive
I can deal with it though
Without the help of a pistol
Fast foot like a native running
Dark eyes like a eagle
To see right through you
Tell me what you've been through
You think I'm kidding
Well you're not even close
Cause there's only a few that I've shown
Peep stories that I see you hide
All those things that keep you guessing
Most people they would call it a gift
I'm just trying to stay alive

To calm the beast that's raging in my head

Known by all to bring men to their knees
My mind bending gravity is nature's worst
Out with the old and in with the new
Cover the night sky stars bound to fall

Out with the old and in with the new
Out with the old and in with the new

Last time we had a battle I looked away and you bit
Shit time of your demise is bring tears to my eyes
I beat the fucking game but it wasn't in time
Your soul is coming with me Simon time to die
Running up the stairs to the top of the room jumping over Barrels like a damn buffoon
I got a fireball chasing after me too it's true
But there ain't no telling how far I'll go
What you think I can't use it on that fireball bro
Nobodies messing with Mario
I ain't about to get beaten but this maze is long
About to put the smack down on Donkey Kong
Take notes as I run up and grab the purse
I got an umbrella too bitch call the hertz
Because I snagged all the blocks on the way to the top
Because I'm worried for my family's health.
It means I'm doing right cleaning up the scene.
An evil doctor stole my girl the bastard
Now I'm the south pacific like the tropic of cancer
No time to answer questions as I ride by
Gonna kill a snail and leave a trail of slime
I'm coming after you cause revenge is mine
Grass skirt keeps my balls from showing
I'll shoot your cat head off punk you can't fuck with me
Avalanche jump over the rocks
Pixie on my shoulder to make the pain stop
On my vacation on adventure island
We need to jump on the clouds below us
I never realized that fairies laid eggs
Jump on the spring and get the maximum altitude
I'm bout take you on a journey I know nothing about
Throwing Jelly beans into my pet blobs mouth
Come on blob we need to go in this hole
I'm a blob The jelly bean king
Strong like Popeye when you give me to me
I'll transform into a rocket and burn the whole town
No time to stop and stare
Take the ketchup bean and take position
Jelly beans don't grow on trees so don't stress
Oh he ran off again just great
You need an umbrella break out the vanilla
Punch bean I'll bust a hole like Godzilla
As the big red balloon comes down
I got the string in my hand and it's tied around my wrist
With a grip so I don't fall on the ground
Hit your teammates twice before they hit the ground
No time to helium up now
Bring it on it ain't a joke when I float
As you plummet to the earth with no friends to stop you
As you fall to the earth and bump your head
Now my balloon's all deflated and popped
With my dude and his big red damn balloon
I think I just avoided a shark too
Don't you know I got tacks in my shoes
And that's my damn balloon
Your dead body's now gonna be shark food
Hit your balloon 2 times and eat my cake too
As you fall to the earth and wreck your kidney
Or I'm gonna hit you on top
Leave your balloon all deflated and popped
Rad Spencer coming through man no need to jump when I'm packing this incredible hand
I got mad skills protagonist I got a grappling arm and a cannon that I shoot with
Bionic Commando is the game you see and you can't stop me
As I break your face on my Titanium knuckles
Now watch as I chuckle away
See I'm the hero of this game here to stop master D
That's another name for Hitler if you're Japanese
They want to bring his ass back to take over the world
But old Rad Spencer... he don't fuck around
As I break your face on my Titanium knuckles
Now watch as I chuckle away
You can't stop me from coming I'm here let me make one more thing perfectly clear
Your days are coming to an end motherfucker...
Thanks for the bazooka that will help there bro
Jump downstairs where he waits in the chopper
Put 3 in you Nazi head now it's time to escape no time to waist
As I fly away I got Joe in my arms
Okay Rad just saved the day
As I break your face on my Titanium knuckles
Off to the cave of monsters right now
Drank some dish soap it's time to throw down
I'm gonna leave your neck swinging like a bobble head
I knew that I would pop you from the minute that you wobbled in
Gobbling all of the apples in sight
It looks like a food fight in here all right
I'll see you all down at the crypt tonight
There ain't no sweat on my dinosaur balls
I'm gonna win it whenever I brawl
These Ghosts right here should be checking their drawls
Hitting with the blow of a million rocky flicks
It's like a bubble makers on my chin
Its time to let the story begin
Man I'm gonna water slide down these falls
I'm gonna bubble up and jump up these walls
Yeah I'm a dragon and I'm kinda small
But don't think that I won't bubble you all
It'll look like a fruit war aftermath
I need to hurry up or I'll die in this map
I just can't rap that fast
Off to the cave of monsters right now
Drank some dish soap it's time to throw down
I'm gonna leave your neck swinging like a bobble head
I knew that I would pop you from the minute that you wobbled in
Gobbling all of the apples in sight
It looks like a food fight in here all right
I'll see you all down at the crypt tonight
There ain't no sweat on my dinosaur balls
I'm gonna win it whenever I brawl
These Ghosts right here should be checking their drawls
Hitting with the blow of a million rocky flicks
It's like a bubble makers on my chin
Its time to let the story begin
Man I'm gonna water slide down these falls
I'm gonna bubble up and jump up these walls
Yeah I'm a dragon and I'm kinda small
But don't think that I won't bubble you all
It'll look like a fruit war aftermath
The bills are piling up and they won't leave me alone
On a quest to get my man Stan Lee on the phone
The names Sketch Turner I'm doing Freelance work
Between the Comic and my music I can't take no more rejection
Hopefully this book will take me in the right direction
Look down see my comic start moving around
That's when the villain of the story starts to make his way out
Stunned He picked me up and with a grunt then he hurled
Me into my imagination of an alien race
Trying to in invade us with their alien face
He thinks he has the key but he don't
He holds no power outside the world that I wrote
Now he has to take me out somehow to get what he wants
He'll never do it in a Bold Face Font
As I make my way through his drawing villains to get me
The only problems I got the power within me
Hit the wall then explode alien goo in you face
I got this girl in the game who thinks that I'm a super human
She calls me the chosen one because I kill and keep moving
Keep jumping on my way across my imagination
With a fist in your mouth and a smile on my face
Should I just sit back and take the fate that you've put in front of me
You don't know how long I've dreamed of you
Now I'm trapped in my designed world
Tear down the page tonight
Leave all the death behind
The drawings I have made
The page I live inside
Hit you against the wall and made your neck go snap
Cut you in half like the grass when I'm mowing my lawn
You don't know how long I dreamed of you
Now I'm trapped in my designed world
You don't know how long I dreamed of you
Now I'm trapped in my designed world
Tear down the page tonight
Leave all the death behind
The drawings I have made
The page I live inside
Tear down the page tonight
Leave all the death behind
The drawings I have made
Bundled up like an Eskimo
I'll get the high score if I do things right
Hit you with my fist and the power with in it
So fast so sly gonna ask who did it
What else a Jackie Chan gonna do
Death punch to your chest and I'll move down south
Do you understand the words coming out of my mouth
Doing spin kicks like a Jackie Chan Do
You and your friends should all probably debate
Eyes so black they gonna call you Chris Tucker
I'm The Drunken Master you Motherfucker
That means I'm really feeling bad for your men
I wouldn't know that if I didn't cover this game
These Bad fellas came and took away my sister
Now their foreheads are gonna be blistered.
You and your friends should all probably debate
Now my metal armors rubbing up against my wood
The name is Arthur that knight that keeps these bitches in check
I'm full of ammunition so I gets respect
Jump on the log take a ride down the river
These punk ass bitches straight prevented my dinner come on
I need a snack bitch get the fuck back... throw my sword make your motherfucking face go splat
Hit me I'll explode my armor will be gone... man its cold outside on the fucking lawn
Running through the cemetery with a sword in my hand
The name is Arthur that knight that keeps these bitches in check
I'm full of ammunition so I gets respect
Jump on the log take a ride down the river
Exiting the stage I got a smile on my face
It's kinda cool because I needed my space
There ain't no sweat on my dinosaur balls.
Ain't no dance that my man can't break.
I made it through the stage like a tidal wave.
The scientist will be my friend anyway
We'll both be the bad guys in the next game.
I got my comfy shoes on I can't complain.
If I explode I'll burst into flames
But I got to go in the name of the game
Man I got more tricks than a deck of cards
This game is more goofy than a kingdom heart
I'm as cool as mustache groomed on my face
I'd rather he take my heart than my mustache anyway
Keep on searching there's an Easter egg
I can't press down can't itch my leg
Climb up the wall and make my way to the battle
Man I'll see you again in World 2
There ain't no sweat on my dinosaur balls.
Ain't no dance that my man can't break.
Framed by the man that I came for
They cursed me and spit in my eyes
I damn them the day that they condemn my name
With the life of crime
So I built me a lab and I waited
I created machines and I cried
They made a mistake when they cursed me that day
Now everyone will die
For this total disaster you will die
I built him a world of destruction
I wanted to make him die slow
A shot to the face couldn't silence my pain
So I'll silence the world below
All of the hate that they gave me
They stripped me of all of means
So I rob the bank with my robot tank
The planet will fear my machines
These robots make me happy just like cotton candy
I laugh when I murder the village it's all handy
I'm so macho my friends call me Randy
I'll smash you with my knuckles
Gonna pop you in the chin
I gotta plot for your destruction
I put a bomb inside your body
Wired you heart to my balls
Man I tore down your walls
These robots make me happy just like cotton candy
I laugh when I murder the village it's all handy
I'm so macho my friends call me Randy
I'll smash you with my knuckles
Gonna pop you in the chin
I gotta plot for your destruction
I put a bomb inside your body
Wired you heart to my balls
Contra force I'll take you and rip you apart
Machine gun kicking like a shot to the heart
Bring it down all you motherfuckers are gonna feel it when I take out this cannon and hit mark...
Test me bitches I'll dodge and jump over
Bill Raiser kicking like a hard core soldier
Take out this flame thrower blow your ass away
The names Bill riser forget about Lance bean
Destroying the red falcon with these sub machines
The alien invaders ain't got nothing on me
Just keep on with your running and jumping
Cause fucking we got the boom to blow your mind
Bitch keep on with your scoping and probing
Just know that we got the bomb gonna put it inside motherfucker
Burning and looting and shit till this invasion is over
I'm brake off smack your fucking face and grind my shoe into your corpse
Till we run out of time
We're gonna gonna brake it down to the fucking ground
Watch me burn a hole in this track I'll put it down
We're gonna kick your fucking ass put up back on the map
Hip Hop is the voice of the voiceless
Coming from conditions of poverty
Hip hop is the voice for the people
Not for the capitalist not for the system
Hip hop is for the hood
All over the world from the South Bronx to Athens Greece.
I knew that it was me.
Drastically things have changed in the culture I love.
What you know about strife and them
This is Life. Our Story. Our Journey. Our Path.
Our craft under attack so we gotta bring it back.
In my heart I really feel it
Is a gift what the future
Carry it in my heart wherever I go
Not just music I like
Write songs for liberation
For future generations
Create a different outcome
Now look at what you done
But how we can keep it bright
We not face to what we say
You try to say that you ain't notice how they look at you
You try to say that I ain't competent for this job
We all up in the same bump gotta get to the stump
So light your blunts or whatever cause that's all right with me
Pimp the system for the people in the school
Slaving workers in the kitchen yeah
We seen police violating peoples rights
Cause over here sticks and stones break your bones
But the prison is what breaks your heart
And that's a long time if you don't turn informer
All day over here it's the same thing
And I ain't never once pulled my pants up on me
Now everywhere I go people still wanna know
So I keep it on me like it's nothing
I say I don't know what can that be
Only difference is a do it in the paper
Keep it on my suffer my TV the other day
Annie to the T to the V you get wreck
Momma look happy in the video you dig
Milkshake game expect that money
Must not have listen to my words or he lying
Hammer that cool and you can't even feel me
They say the cool is all over me
Bass through the walls
DJ spinning that feeling that song
Excuse me can I get by here
Place so packed can't move nowhere
There's buzzing in my pocket let me check my phone
What we always got to do with them type of dudes
That was in a good mood now they fucking my shit
I remember why because you did the same thing
Does it really have to be a situation
You ain't never gonna find what you looking for
How come they call me the dope boy then
Do I look like I sell drugs
Up in the club I'm trying to figure what's up
And my cell in the other receiving a lot of calls
But I focus on the night so I don't pick up
I'm loving the dope boys filling the tip cup
But let me decipher the code I find to get down
You wouldn't believe it we write shit like this
For the white ones mummy take her clothes off
It's real sat but it's real down town
The club is full of the hustlers stacking dollars
How come they call me the dope boy then
They wanna know why we look like a gang
We're just doing our thing
They wanna know why we walk like we walk
So I tell them like it is
You don't need to know why I do what I do
Listen to the boss when I work in here
I'm just trying to work in here
They wanna know what we do when we're in the crib
That know some drugs.
So I tell Them how to fuck with you.
You don't know me why should you care
Stop asking questions man
How we used to run back then
Look at the smile on the kid but on the inside
Surrounded by issues they stuck right with him like
On the regular we got fiends in the house
And it's so damn hard to kick those type of habits to the side
When all they do is stick to you
We already seen too much of that
Like you can't have one without the other
Only fuck what you think was right or wrong
I didn't think about it till I headed home
Luckily she got her back on her feet
Around the same time my brother back on the street
Shit was so crazy man yeah
More colorful than I could ever depict
I would have never thought that
To be having my feet where they supposed to be
Right on the ground on that hard concrete
To be having my feet where they supposed to be
Right on the ground on that hard concrete
Sorry my heart that I can't make it through
I would have loved to see you shooting them hoops
Can be there though I wish that I was
Every time you look to this dance
Don't forget that that all it takes is a call
You know I try harder
This time I try harder
You know I try harder
This time I try harder
Ever since i was a kid
And I wasn't like you
I would just me in the mirror
Not like you and the t and the arrow
They did you do what you lick in the weaver
I could feel that was a cliff
But you can always be like this
This if you pick your own way
And you refill your own gain
And you use your own brain
Always been like this
Always gonna live like a punk
So if you feel like this
Don't fall all the risk
Understand it's up to you
What they do it's well of it
They can tell me shit
And i can laugh as if
And it just doesn't instead
Did i just hear complaining
Cause in my ear what i do of
I hear your voice on the current
Seeping through the cracks in the hull
Can't find a port in this storm
But I'm sheltered and warm
Squinting in the glow
Is it a beacon of hope
Or trust a flame I really don't know
But against this tower of light
I can make out a vessel
I wonder what my dad really thinks
When I air our business out in a blink
I ain't thought about it twice
Always knew what I would think of it
But it's not even about that anymore
I just don't want it to be like it was before
So I'm trying real hard not to point fingers
Hoping I can leave the drugs by the door
And never ever mention them again
Even though I know you're still using
You rather see your soon blind
Let's try the sure way fine
I hear your voice on the current
Seeping through the cracks in the hull
Can't find a port in this storm
But I'm sheltered and warm
Squinting in the glow
Is it a beacon of hope
Or trust a flame I really don't know
But against this tower of light
I can make out a vessel
I don't think I have your number
We barely even speak when we see each other
I think we both on a guilt trip
Has always been to keep it at a distance
So far away as possible
But if it makes any difference
I hope we can jump this obstacle
That has been our lives
All the ups and downs and ins and outs
Remember when you sent me all those letters
I'm thinking I should read some now
To better understand what you felt locked up in a four by four of a cell
With two kids on the outside
I hear your voice on the current
Seeping through the cracks in the hull
Can't find a port in this storm
But I'm sheltered and warm
Squinting in the glow
Is it a beacon of hope
Or trust a flame I really don't know
But against this tower of light
I can make out a vessel
Maybe this is overdue
Or is it better not to
I just want to put it behind me
And think about what I miss
And right now that's a mist
So I couldn't really tell you
If you would ever ask me it
But you would never ask me shit
You would never ask me shit
Then your record starts to get a little spin
Well there's one more hour until the sun goes down
One more chance to make it happen right now
In this sense I don't know where I'm going
You don't have anything to prove
Can't wait for the new my cool
To be honest I don't know if I have it
I've been looking all over for the magic
But it's just not happening
I'm afraid of the outcome
And I'm afraid of my album
When they hear how much I doubt them
Well there's one more hour until the sun goes down
One more chance to make it happen right now
All the hours that put me here
And I don't wanna be in vain
I just can't see it I swear
But sometimes I get really low
There's not a word on paper
And I don't know which way to go
This has to thrill my haters
Kind of like I'm on a rebound
I wrote a verse but it took three hours
To get sixteen got caught in the moment
That's just how it goes sometimes
These are thoughts that's on my mind
This is why it's taking time
I can't help that I'm
Afraid that I'm not who you say that I am
Did a lot of things but a lot of things weren't really planned
It's creeping up like...
Well there's one more hour until the sun goes down
One more chance to make it happen right now
And I ain't never once pulled my pants up on me
Now everywhere I go people still wanna know
So I keep it on me like it's nothing
I say I don't know what can that be
Only difference is a do it in the paper
Keep it on my suffer my TV the other day
Annie to the T to the V you get wreck
Momma look happy in the video you dig
Milkshake game expect that money
Must not have listen to my words or he lying
Hammer that cool and you can't even feel me
They say the cool is all over me
Then your record starts to get a little spin.
I'm chilling in the sofa
Fucked up in this fucked up culture
Images of me not getting older be fucking my mind
Drugs destroy so many young lives but fuck it not mine
What you know about this
When kids are willing to sell their mom just to get a hit
But i cant front these drugs got me busting mad vocals
I still remember the first time I puffed that herb yo
You made a bad choice in life kid fuck if that my loss
Who knows it works both ways
So I managed to control my conquerer
I even know when the bastard opened his mouth to try and outsmart me with his mouth
Don't let a piece of ass control your mind
But what you do know is
That you gotta use a rubber
Then go home to your girl swallow your guilt tell her you love her
Because he thinks he can't eat the same meal everyday
So if you comprehend this you can call me a prick
The rest of you will follow this tip probably thank me for it
One of these days people gonna say
They came the song took over the place
They were hitting hard oh my god
Is that this type of thing happen everyday
Things can change oh my god
One of these days people gonna say
They came the song took over the place
They were hitting hard oh my god
Is that this type of thing happen everyday
Things can change oh my god
It's R O C K with the rhyme that's played
Be blasting rappers away every single time I blaze a laze
Line after line busting rhyme after rhyme blowing mind after mind
Three different rappers mastering three languages
I don't mind saying it
Things about to change
See what's going down
One of these days people gonna say
They came the song took over the place
They were hitting hard oh my god
Is that this type of thing happen everyday
Things can change oh my god
One of these days people gonna say
They came the song took over the place
They were hitting hard oh my god
Is that this type of thing happen everyday
Things can change oh my god
Ain't nothing to do it
That's how we do it baby
Stuck in the middle...
Thinking about where is was raised and where I'm from
Didn't know much and had to grow up really fast
Wit my pops behind bars and my mom was short on cash
See we all up in the party and we doing our thing
And that's how it's supposed to be now
See we all up in the party and we doing our thing
And that's how it's supposed to be now
See we all up in the party and we doing our thing
I could give you what you want
If you give me what you need
I could take away your pain
And still bring you to your knees
I don't need no guns or drugs
I just need my own company and I'm free
Time after time I'm clocking in the night shift
Blow that green for the environmental crisis
They all stop when he pull out the whistle
Our team to the game fires the missiles
Color of the revolution yeah my voice should be heard
From misters to misses to hipsters and more
This efficient you wish you had this in store
But you don't so move on we always rock steady
Born for this purpose I'm way beyond ready
Way beyond any story that'll come to an ending
Fair weather friends see the sun shining
Need find a way to prescribe the mind when crunch time hits
Been dreaming about this since the lunch line with the lights on my kicks
I heard of something but I'm still unaware of specifics
I don't care if it's by the Atlantic or the Pacific
It's obvious that I slur semantics
Careers with no spark tend to fade out and vanish
So don't take on more than you can manage
Now you wonder why I wouldn't trade my life w you
Would you be so kind just say it
Would you be so kind just say it
Would you be so kind just say it
I think I've had enough of this one
I think I've had enough of this one
She don't know what's up
I think I've had enough of this one
I think I've had enough of this one
She's gotta quit showing off to all of her friends
But I think my shadow needs it
And forget all about it
I think I've had enough of this one
I think I've had enough of this one
Now bring that body closer for a few
I think I've had enough of this one
I think I've had enough of this one
And I tried to make you understand that I'm not sorry
Put all my trust in you while we were a fling
Apologies won't come from me
Don't believe ya to be someone of a quality
You're lower than the European economies
I know what you do when you visit your friends at their colleges
Don't acknowledge me anymore
I can't fuck with you
I don't know what to do
You were way too quick to get comfortable
We all know this shits nothing new
Girl I've done enough for you
And I'm hardly getting repaid
Many days since we laid
It's a difference of opinion
I think ya wish it was different
But ya kissed him in the kitchen
So I went along and broke it
Sorry I don't wanna continue this intermission
I'm in the middle of switching to someone more open
But I only focus on what I keep closest
You're a plague and I don't need no locusts
Go find out what's at the bottom of the ocean
And I tried to make you understand that I'm not sorry
Put all my trust in you while we were a fling
You know I wile out every time that I go south
A situation that I had a just pull out
So you can get that tattoo w you own cash
Didn't wanna admit it but you've got no ass
It's hard to get used to someone who moves so fast
Ya took ecstasy in Chesapeake
You don't need a tell me the rest of it
And know my recipe is excellent
You're another notch on my headboard
Never ever let her get near me again
Oh shit don't hold me back
Peace and quiet you owe me that
Leaving you the loneliest
Girl fall back like the foliage
Ya can't change the past
It's a concrete fact I won't be sleeping on the sidewalk
Let bygones be bygones it happens a lot
Often misconstrued as a student but I'm a boss
Then spend an afternoon in the boondocks baby
And they curious about my whereabouts
Picture perfect world production not produced by Paramount
I've been around the world at unconventional hours
To stay prepping up for whatever is next
Soon enough you'll be hearing this voice upon the radio
Or the fact that I haven't gotten down in a while
The correct information makes it all happen
And me in your bed could make us all happy
Yoga mat in your arms well I don't know how
Gotta assist with the scoring
Got a mission before me
Just listen up to this recording
I want somebody to need this body
I want somebody to need this body
Make you love me not what's in my wallet
One quick pace and ya face got me brainwashed
Sun came out and the god damn rain stopped
Burnt brown hair and an Hermes tank top
Obvious attraction you and me it's physics
Let me know if you wanna get in it
Been meaning to write you sincerely
So let me lay this down
Ain't much to say unless it's a vow
Twitter plus the couch equals never gonna blow
You on the come up like your leaders got his eyes closed
I'd arrive before you if I decide to drive slow
But I'm not I'm posted up never lie low
You'll vanish real quick like your missing dog Fido
Been meaning to write you sincerely
So let me lay this down
Ain't much to say unless it's a vow
It's a curse and a blessing to get this way in the first place
And your shit was supposed to drop around my 15th birthday
Gotta be real and cleaned up behind curtains
I've seen it before but good job
They click next stray away quick move along
Mind is traveling to a height that'll send your ass packing
In the third row seat of the van realizing opportunities within patience
Instant gratification not planned for your brand
Been meaning to write you sincerely
So let me lay this down
Ain't much to say unless it's a vow
I never wanna know ya
I think I see him walking
Collide with the ghost above my floor
I think I see him walking
Say hi to the ghost I won't become
He and I could fight all night
I'm torn inside but act so bright
And who to be I can't decide
Indulge in all types of pleasures
Don't talk to him I can explain it much better
Looking in the mirror finding someone to shout to
The answer's in the haze so I'll figure it out soon
The ego in each of us wants to eat through the furnace
And then heat up your house and just laugh it off as it's burning
I never wanna know ya
I think I see him walking
Collide with the ghost above my floor
I think I see him walking
Say hi to the ghost I won't become
The diamond's getting bigger I'm in the rough of the Rockies
Despite it all I can find the courage
But he's in the basement playing games with the devil
He only wants to stay in and polish up all his medals
Spun out in the city makes it hard to say I'm stable
Crumbs crushed up on the old wooden table
This time in a house of a friend of a friends
And that girl Zoe over there knows the deal
I don't wanna cuff to confine me
Any minute now we can exit the spot
And take what we got home and get acquainted
This house so big it needs exploring
So come along girl were diving in head first
I said yeah baby yeah make that granite counter top yours
One more minute and we'll bring it to the bottom floor
Barely know her but I know that she's rarer than moon rocks
I don't wanna cuff to confine me
Any minute now we can exit the spot
And take what we got home and get acquainted
And she moan every time I'm in it
Undecided but I find her with me
Wake up and she's by my left
Please tell me that we ain't have sex
Her cigarette taste all on my breath
Spending every evening together like olden days
And she moan every time I'm in it
Undecided but I find her with me
Wake up and she's by my left
Please tell me that we ain't have sex
You can hear the party from a mile away
Unmatched smile got the style and grace
So if you wanna move lets find the pace
Have your friends bring they friends like one two three
Don't give it up so fast
I could show you how to groove with it
Don't give it up so fast
Don't give it up so fast
I think I might choose you miss
Don't give it up so fast
There's moves to be made and I was made to make moves
On the floor with four girls so that's eight shoes
Don't give it up so fast
I could show you how to groove with it
Don't give it up so fast
Don't give it up so fast
I think I might choose you miss
Don't give it up so fast
I don't care if she's driving
Make sure I won't be drunk dialing
Chemistry's keeping all night and day
I'm one of the son of a guns who can get a good nun to get up and get drunk
I'm complacent I'm not really someone to talk a face off at four in the morning
She caught me by the eye
While she with another man
But I got to slow it down she still
Recovering from last time
She caught me by the eye
While she with another man
She pushed me I fell right back upon my bed
You might regret it but I can do it better than him
Detaching strings I make her laugh and think
You bring your girls I got my guys
And we could stay at my place
It's right down that way
Is a love such as that which I exhibit for my practice
Huddled in brackets that blacken the average globe
I carve a notch in my wall for every stall
Every fifth mark slants diagonal to symbolize your downfall
The point at which repellent signals ultimately bind
When a pack of style mimics see my brains target the cluster
Once my brethren disperse...
But I don't confide wine and water chose me
Still another took a turn and crashed and burned while others flee
Picture your imagery embellished with the hellish aspects of the swarm's forlorn facets
Surgeon purging poetic lead poison
From ducks in my carnival to vipers in my garden
You flash identify bottom genus species and class start to chuckle...
Buckle the architecture till it fell through.
I'll have put aside a few to get myself situated
I live for the moment of truth
It fucks a little with my brittle gift
Proper application of the soul by my standard.
Candid was position from which instigations spawn
Volatile strobe while your blind spot swallows the globe
Sing to the track and think back
When I was a boy I employed styles exhausted
By every lost child at present
Normally I drill pillars of normalcy
You're cordially invited to accompany me
In rotations of the tables to label the opposition
Rapidly dissolved my involvement in a solvent of soul and roll back
Like livestock infected with anthrax
Where the bluest ribbons yield the glory days
Desire on the opposite circuit and glorious days
Is glorious hazes of gray spun through my array of operation
And wrapped tightly in a practice with my colleagues and slackers
20,000 league nappers and the swelling increases
Once the mortar hit the pestle your whole vessel fell to pieces
The all new and improved poetically portable Aesop Rock
You'd better let your gods recognize the Rhyme Inspector hides
And never sweat them lies about me haters check your eyes
Leave you back in time and I'll be there still ain't at my prime
One child prodigy with a vision in his core.
So I design this chorus line.
When linked we let our eyelids fall and pilots stall.
Hiding behind the levy while the stubborn rivers rise and feel this.
I wish heavenly brevity centered hate pedigrees instead of dead serenity.
God damn. Must have remembered me.
But couldn't quite catch the angle.
I'm trained as cornerstone famine trooper
I'm a sideline observer alerted not yet retreating.
The climate stubbornly hovered slightly above freezing.
I spit a billion tiny brilliant white lights into the sky
By the way the clues churn in front of my eyes...
I don't wanna pull the plug...
More like I'm walking with a broken mood ring.
Here to bevel the edge.
My team's settled on the ledge to pledge.
In the summer it rains buckets of hunger pains.
Yet the songs of thirst remain the same.
Militant dance split the sun and sip the filament...
They try to grace these sacred lips with his maze or a dirty wine.
More than raindrops in a well
Fully sold on operation
I will survive when sprayed by heavens liquid ammunition
Born clutching a fistful
A chorus line of blind crazes
As skinny clique mechanics flock to block pick of the land
We stretch the earth around the canvas
Dragging stick in the sand
Amid your tireless bold
Behold that iris spits clips
Skating slalom through this churning murder columns
I am not entirely trained to undo the shame
To whose delinquent dichotomy
That's when freak sons Fade to Black
Bounty hunt the front to document the frosh cluster
Fade me. I flee the scene
Like chain gang escapees
We cadets hold determination
We leak passion for the noise
There is not a track to cherish
From he who lacks merit
Exerted to color mavericks alerted
Herd a billion nervous lost child prodigies home to flourish
Now taciturn facets burn open to yield malarkey navigator
When wrestled on fancy driftwood out the vessel
Interject a bad dream candidly
Between myself and fame's embrace
Presence resonant with
Chiaroscuro atmospheric traps
Inhabit the land of denied clearance
The course the corpse patients
And tainted curiosities allowed the freak show to continue
And decorate the dusk like henna to hand
We unknowingly sketched the pentagram by sending clans
Bizarre pattern with a bad vibe
Amongst the stagnant trend frenzy
I sip to grip a stationary pillar
Yet we slipped these boogie nights
Sucked wattage from rookie lights
Just to touch the mushroom cloud
Lord have mercy on their dreams...
Pretty pixels tend to trickle down the screen
To feed the arts my spirit and to bleed merit
Kings to alley urchins
These trades fade as cadavers due to conflicting data matter
First heard as remarkable is now labeled as unmarketable
Treading evoke dreaded Leviathan
Headed to crunch the world of MC etiquette
A maverick like myself bottles the creativity
Till the cocoon naturally peels back
This little light of mine shines
At a hundred billion times
The magnitude of every star
Within an ample sky sample
It fester when ingested
Addressing helots to zealots
To Jezebel's to hellish felons
Granted my span of attention is not what it used to be
But most of y'all delinquents ain't amusing me no more...
Finding the night train mildly therapeutic.
Leaking smoke rings singing...
Tampering hampered scampered well beyond the dooms.
My clique heeds lessons I'll be noted from kids sisters paper dolls.
Its flight of the intruder and we all fall down.
Conditions of never blends science with religion
But finding no intrinsic merit in your sense.
Drunken distortion and spit the filter in.
Mic sweltering measures like melting my rings together and you never
I'm here to ride upon the night train...
With the worlds ends calibrated in their briefcases
Soon to be flustered and clustered in with comrade trash hurlers.
And the climate stubbornly hovered slightly above freezing.
So I could slide my guided tenants on the one.
Brick in the wall installments draw a fallen performance.
Kingpin allow only the murkiest swamp bot
Watch laboratory clone demotions dodge on natural hate crops.
With the bearers of the reptile smile
Kids wanna know the Aesop Rock...
Sink through the track and think back.
You're all cordially invited to accompany me
In rotations at the tables to label the opposition
Refused to evolve with the cold.
Rapidly dissolve my involvement in a solvent of soul
Like livestock infected with anthrax.
I reside up on the opposite circuit in glorious dazes
Spun through my array of operations
Slave to idiot box revelations
That wrap tightly in a practice
With my colleagues and slackers...
Straight 20,000 league mappers.
And the swelling increases...
Your whole vessel fell to pieces...
Synthesized lies rise synthetic
Yellow brick stalker walking shifty...
My wingspan stands flags in the snow of the poles.
Swerve my alignment towards solitary confinement and jade it.
Man I'll bomb you please from up in the trees
Load a back alley shiner liquid
but share the passion with but a small percentage of the masses and their fashion
You got a feeling that you got me where you want me
I've wait within the palm of your hand
And you've got cartoons in the morning while I'm sleeping
I've just got dreams that I don't understand
called freaks give me no floor feet all sweet small peeks
cause my stocks exchange they bore street still the slick
Spit more rounds than Bruce Willis flicks
Ideas and flow raise eyelids that's why kids make hybrid rhymes
supplied with step this God did years ago to grasp a taste
Coward of the year make others fear the way this brother is empowered
I address but a rapidly lessoning portion of majors
We have never dined on bait so when corrupt crooks
Synthesized lies rise synthetic
Yellow brick stalker walking shifty...
My wingspan stands flags in the snow of the poles.
Swerve my alignment towards solitary confinement and jade it.
Paws curled beneath your head
Till the sun came round just around noon.
Drawing up your tail around my hips
For the love of my personal practice I reside
Slide fuel by the fury
Spun a ring around my honor
But the opulence took shelter in my horror.
Melancholy masquerade
Cast amongst the braiding of belligerence
And blazing terror that blew the lock down off my placement.
I stay special agent till the sky falls
Reverse the curse till my fellow lost children disperse
And your footsteps leading down the pathway
Never seem to be quite like my own...
It blinded me till I turned towards home...
And you would watch me far in the distance
Hands held high above your head.
I only leave the territory when there's nothing left to be said.
Swoop down from the trees with potpourris and other bandits.
That sting never fades like belly wounds from sling blades
Lunged nicotine dream missing languorous
Caution we proclaim until brain's off like Sagittarius
Shield. Yield to the eye mescaline killer veals
Sing rumble blue conglomerates sucking up lung while brushing parasitic critics to my left side.
I test glide kamikaze crashed to thoughtless on my preface.
The therapeutic unit recommended.
The hollow of his hand beholds contraptions via
Chordata asylum swarmed your coordinates. Rush.
I'll tourniquet your turbulence then trample on your stutters.
If I could displace every vagrant in America with traces of my character the Earth would be a more pitiful habitat.
Swept off your meridian. It's operation Start With a Slummy Raped Your Milk and Honey.
I'm forever building my City of Lost Children ripping rungs off your ladder at a
Sardonic smirk. Ebonics lurking where the crop circles got stamped out from the rain dance.
While cannily panicking was the average. I broadcast modern boredom mesozoic poetry pupils.
Caught up in scruples from the inimical nature of my program.
The lost child venomous neck that spittles off my chin
Special investigations set king pin
Bounce and of course your happy
Axis pivotal point spun all to often
Now walk and spin cycle
You're playing your chances broken branches
Scattered around your mainframe type uproot it
My hand saluted eastward compass is spinning
Magnetic field my metal mind driven
Threshold fresh coke crush and affect
Mic check and spin a rec conglomerate
The heated mass of fire and gas threatens your retina
Itching for what could have been if not for who
I'm with 50 million troops upon my side
Flying towards the fraudulence coordinates
While the other drove my flag into your sidewalk
My sprouts stalks pawns and then I'm gone
Close encounters of the first kind
Contact cursed minds skies red
Stuck sitting spinning world wide webs
Over whim and worry flurried on your sidesteps
My pride treads thick
Utilize wide lens I slide strength in
Automatic hell habitat
Boo signs reduced y'all troops to tragedy
Radically millions morphing the orphans
Piteous portions lacked a guiding light
Dark then gray shapes
Till the splays made illustrate my views on sanity
If you're feeling famished we are family
Aesop Rock the canopy seek shelter
I have weaved a web across the sky hovering covering all
Night crawling audio visual veterans
Spreading like spores to the homes of all average Americans
50 million poets screaming all on the run
That's 50 million hearts beating as one
I'm with 50 million troops upon my side
Flying towards the fraudulence coordinates
While the other drove my flag into your sidewalk
The sound of silence versus the sound of War
Your ignorant bias is my Goliath
Starving alliance seeps under the skin
The seven deadly sins
That seven elements of the malevolent
Poetic potential draws dotted lines between hunter and hunted
Lieutenant cynic consist of anonymous all this seems famished
Pressure point contact
Crush the dormant with missing links
Behold of the hideous
I'm assaulted by the anthems of the lesser
A faceless figure shall put among an infinite citizens capital coward branded in the backbones of the stranded
Pays quicken upon asphalt light source sun burst beams
A portrait of pillage
Indulge indefinite challenging chapters never before have human eyes looked upon
The unbearable weight
Contaminate little thieves
The center of my web is pen and ink
Threw my flag into the ground and claimed your land for starving artists
The masquerade merging separate flows of music's martyrs
Threw my flag into the ground and claimed your land for starving artists
I am so very sorry that my son has made such an exhibition of himself with your daughter
It really does seem quite out of character
Although I have to admit it is quite funny
Of course he's really got into trouble with his supervisor
But I'm afraid he's only got himself to blame
All I see is little plastic soldiers with little plastic holsters
Spit on plastic cultures belittled by sarcastic vulture swarms
Warning I'd skip your stepping stones down by the sea shore
It's that scarlet welcome carpet that I fiend for
Red skies bleeding acid this is best inspired by your doubt
All through flood fire and drowning tied rapidly into humid winds
Eye of the storm following scraping my backbone
While figments of malignant spine pleasuring quick to pigment puddles
As still in dreams while empires fall apart
He a cyborg killing machine with wires in his heart
I'll never know of you
Emotion reads close encounters I run
Trampled pride resurrected with ample improvement motor movement mandatory
Not a question of should I
But I passively consumed the role casted by masters of supreme sources
Crafted by supreme forces
Seemingly dream catcher
See you lack a dispatch to request back up
Collapsing scaffold mad pole crusher Russian robot recruits
I'm excluding inaudible slaughter calls
This young man is clearly a genetic throwback
He seems to be experiencing primeval urges and feelings which frankly
Unless we can terminate will contaminate others
You replicas overlooking the guidelines of acoustics
Miserable attempts result in miserable conclusions
Then a comfortable silence try to combat cliques
I stagger this vagabond wondering menstrual forms of phobia
Worst fear the terrace stricken muted
The roots of all evil I've rooted pinnacle
Agony rides inside the heartache wretched condition
My intuition felt you slip up
Thou perceives a slaughter suspension
Relentless agent hush horrendous circles on my pavement
Two sticks to burn basics the lie adjacent to my placement
Stall face to face with a forms that force your downfall
Like while I put my foot down stomp your city
Iron clad oracle test three COM unit disperse silently
Over confidence leads to irony
Plot twist full hardy Icarus shifted in facets of my form
Forbidden aspects of the swarm a thorn upon your side
Crook you're shook you started poorly
Your powers parted pace uncharted territory
Disoriented malicious god you'll burn your bridges
This craft requires first drafts
From the nine rings of Donnie's hell burn you in your slumber
Sleepwalk then pulled under now
Whipping through the willows is the warden of this garden
Don't wind up war painted into the jungle the solution's not intrusion
The starving institution broke your main frame
Our planet is the pivotal point
In which this network slowly turns to filter kicks
My clench is frantic clutch manners falling through underbrush
Touch fools that duel with a dominant
First time I bumped heads with my
Dust mite harbored spite it barely
Chance to land in camps branded with
Push. lets push up through the
Zipped lips clipped to my peaking
Under the mass of genie bottle
Hostages who wish that a
Third to her broken promises.
Castle and master passageway.
Even the innocent captives
Hassle factor's feet. pin the
Tail on the village idiot
Turn giddy click stern greet a
Burn it basics laid with the
Modes of neurotic nitpicking
Patrons and their pseudo potent
Patronage ah mood of the moment
Gloated in splendor of its
Act as if apathy's been your
Best friend since the bonding I'll one
On a sunny afternoon in lower east side New York...
Good morning my sweet vision of morbid disorder
And good evening wonderful riddance and such
Maybe today I'll touch the burgundy halo
Trimming the tunnels and offend with tenants
Spangled cross a more tangible premise
My palms are generous
When I witness fury scurry past my window
Model city in a bottle plugged hostile
Its bliss kissing polluting
And a billion suckers pucker in a bind
Maybe the sunken ship is the treasure
I try to spin me dizzy sponging
As opposed to art historians absorbed inside assumptions
Everybody pop your knuckles when the style divorces vertical
Marveling at the spite with which it curdled
Outside my tenement grows a little warmth
From out the mugs of masons wasted
Laying bricks for days to later find they owned the lot adjacent
Mark the blasphemy elements of elegance and savagery
In a matchbox conveniently padlocked to the hammer base
Sabotage with my beast of burden pertinence of if I die this year
My name's a thousand steps from patience
But I'm sick and tired of waiting
My name is every imperfection that plays a part in my dissension
My name is delicate approach from symmetrically to my fellowship
My name is contaminate the rich
And clock the profits for the captive's sake
Let us hope that the horrors of evil no longer loiter on the doorstep of your past
Circle of sandbags drag the shield a meal the meaty hand grabs
I'm splitting hopes at your local Acropolis
Opulence in a cockpit not the pocket for them born with a pepper toss
Sunk to rest while they've exhausted the art of drunken address
Exhibit fracture lines that converge towards where the hackers whine
Where trappers slack the traps
Unlatch the catch then cover up his trackers line
That will make his majesty furious
Oh bury his head and how could I have been so dense
My days graze normalcy then morbidly crash
My years breathe honesty then sardonically laugh
I'm tossing darts at a map of the arts to pick up where you choked
And when the last leaf falls off the branches of resonance
I'll be waiting with my butterfly net to collect the evidence
Well I am a room with poison oak scaling the sides
If you can squeeze between the bars
Enjoy my space employ my waste
And change the hand dealt by a stolen grace
Do you ever wish the circle was a square
So when land sharks start circling the borders
You could just cut them off at the corners
There's a ghost in the basket of values
Now I'm surfing it through
So if you need me spread your wings to spell my name
Above the mess near the other funny requests
See mild to tolerant mannerisms of higher to win
To assist in a meticulous pick a part of cobweb of skins
A child of timid instinct with that ten step ahead premise
Supply dust bowls before the zephyr was requested
Violent humble shoes ten shades of blues come off the difference
My name's a thousand steps from patience
But I'm sick and tired of waiting
My name is every imperfection that plays a part in my dissension
My name is delicate approach from symmetrically to my fellowship
My name is contaminate the rich
And clock the profits for the captive's sake
My name is scrutinize
My name is consequence
My name is cigarettes
My name's hallucinogen
My name is alarm clock
So when 20 count regrets float down futility spillage
See I'll pass the broken arrow this time for certain
Yea but from here on out its hoof the mare the bare footed urchin
Now exhibit true audacity and passively hack grease into ribbons
Activist legends turned hostage in fallen cities
Dirty earthlings circling vision immaculate
Spin me dizzy in a crosswalk
My too far gone mastodon senses inspect relentless
For fitted boogie systems and crook addictions
Well sure my crown is formed of thorns
Yea but my thorns are formed of sound
And I have found sound will keep me warm
When the mornings born with frozen ground
Put a rope down pull me from where the buzzards cleared
Mistook for aspiring third world poster children
Dead to administer links like chief then what's your forte
Devil dragger in disguise seeking the match made in your eyes
Friend it don't take the wise this minute triplicate pace unified
I don't condone the blasphemy naturally its procreation
All of which I witnessed prior to waking up inside my room
Look at the crook as I panic episode tantrums
The edginess readies the mock knock quick draw hence the duel
Canopy draped beautiful messiah reluctant
Stowaways inside the cargo bed
Said leech prior to firing up his barnacle magnet
Instincts leashing himself to where the wind splitting ice storms
And termite swarms are commonplace
I'm a trace this silver lining winding round the profit chase
I know there is good in you if one peels back the opulence
But I also know its ratio the bad don't feed my confidence
The nutrients will be intense circle
The clues units of success being personal
Then sucked basic diversion
Rusty anchor budget for nothing
I can't believe I'm still concerned
Well I yield to hear your burns
And all I ever wanted was to aggravate the sleepers
Coax twenty four sevens of wide eyes from day dreamers
Clean or dirty serpents in turn wish preference for the latter
Justified the germs burn cauterize the gashes after
Who's cloaked in a pristine mantle of hellfire
Born for one task indeed
Of a billion troops holding matchsticks to empty cannons
Stand of a many moons when the sun hit the mountainside splendidly
Bask in the last warmth that be known to man's tangents
Managed to carve initials in the granite wall the damned it all up
Cats that forage through the moats
The well its almost six o'clock
Tune onto the forbidden channel
And see it like it is baby
You should be a champion
I was thinking about my sick friend
Stringing a ring around my whit's end
13 loops later his feet hung inches out the pig pen
Motley day goblins brought up pillage to pass the stillness
With bad javelin tip dipped inside barrel black magic brilliance
To capture the fashion fragment choreographed in traffic dancing for nickels
One hope distortion odyssey sputters itself to my how not example sample
Give me the bread crust while considering the littering
I choked when the cage bird sings and stings
Springs me up delirium to stitch the clipped wings
I say instinctively break through while clinging the shrieking souls
Mourning the death of full and high to loss of quality control
Incorporate the unison of Vikings ship rowers plus the perfection
Of a billion hungry victims gripped by the hell that's left to splinters
Broken penny bank fragments float up at stagnant seas
Dirty work plus applicants with chatter box disease
Asked for many moons and I can't stand it any more
This is how I feel that I sling
And the regulars were so amazed
There is a time for war and a time for peace
And a time to run and a time to split
I built boats of a pack rat bats of bully club swung
Post utility inhalants nail it to stability and sail it
Lopsided Star bird bow crooked mass makeshift
Patching holes with chewing gum and stitching sail to thirty phases
I know that once that wind kicks up you and your motors left rope to the dock
Of blue sky of a happy neighborhood
String on my ring has left me dancing like wooden dummies in a paper nature
Hiding a fish out of water complex provided upon entry
And blame my chemical imbalance for the fact I've made a mess
And part of you just wants to sit and be impressed with
Tainted agony induct in barnacle attachments
Mood swinging upon the barnstorm to perpendicular traffic
I'm tired of being wired into the thief ratio
They have plenty of nothing and nothing is plenty for them
I've never had it so good
And the saints go marching in
Serpentine regime ordered by response sort of fell this population
Caboose humming no fence me in a van with common patrons
The parody plastered every red brick in site
Where had to keep his plights from ticking
I'm slipping my key and whim dim by dirty tap water and that
Let's connect the thrill of volume to a flat earth
Spangled in hooks dangled by anglers off the plank of burning books
Kill joy inherited by spirits lacking harnesses
So I feed idea turn sun dial to bastards son adopt the reroute dreaming
Oh I'll ride the plain bow in flare gully yellow rain coat
Heard a harp but sunny ways my lifeline searching for the same note
Dig my tossing sturdy walking head hung
Skylark litigants strung out like cats straight up participants
Working class trash raped where racist hit their high
I spy a toddler on the corner with her bubbles and her dipstick
I witness the fusion of her breath and her amusement
And it killed me and it stabbed me and it cut me clear open
The notion that this child timid in her sins embraced pleasure
I'll take the hint but still she's never known cold
Call me in twenty when those bubbles explode it's like that
Back to back to back to stacking a brick match
With the fact that I've sipped the dripping sap tap
Casually out the limbs of captivated blends back
Tracking the patterns that trim friends to thinning savages
But you quest tore your floorboards and the carpet turned marbles
With an eyedropper a poison passions hoist above the masses
Like a symmetric snow flake visits and with her symmetry blizzards
To those who stand truly deserving and the list ain't long
Even birds of our combines float if you let them
They'll be dodging more than cradles when the bough breaks
Oh my left hand is a brick layer my right hand is a plow face
We build and destroy in response to every sound the crowd makes
On the palette of the almighty for painting the first half of me
Honor find it with monster mashing in text casually
On the palette of the almighty to paint the second fraction
Succulent aqua marines hide the in by sweetest elixir
Star heckler and leaders start gawking at yet another
Real conceived green fetus beating parallel sterile fixture
The over spilled theory's all faucet
Slither spiraling banister down a hide
My ruby glass glazed specs staple to trade the market thieves
Where vendors count the stolen citrus out they pyramids
Merry without a slapstick mavericks plugged directly to 3rd rail surges
Piss on electric mayhem through city commuter circuits
Infected projection hung thicken the air
Pungent is burning plastics upon whiffing the nasal cringes
Sweet Christ crucify me with railroad spikes
Where sitting with a stranger and living awards the badges
I spell Merit with my name stitched on my heritage
Incinerate arrogant simpletons to feed my cherished wind
Maybe I'll craft the sycamore canoe and paddle upstream
Where the luck seems to reflect precious lovely interventions
For kicking your fantasies overboard
And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed
And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed
And in the morrow stood a thousand steps from where my nervous laughter made abode at
Dig in the dirt I bring up the earth like pulley systems
Thereby painting the perfect metaphor for hung juries
Strung along a song of spawning thorns of fury
And dive and finding my thriving ivy leaves climbing up the pit wall
Yo if I flutter in a trouble clutch then I dance fancy forward
My wing span can and will employ full expansion
Unfolding while lamping at home with my hands panning for gold
All y'all saw was Aesop Rock holding an empty book of matches
Maybe I'll sit until the spilling motors clear
Bundled in my humble little plummet
Numb enough to die those thousand deaths under the sun it makes
For kicking your fantasies overboard
And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed
And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed
For kicking your fantasies overboard
And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed
Oh Distribute sour inhalants regulate lobby developments
Today summon the rug rat oblivious to what's delicate.
Tomorrow siphon imperfection out the fetus prior to selling it.
There is a brain in the thicket tap circle cupping the port to accord it
Plated pearly gates enchanted axis with high gentry hinging our binging on public picket fencing
Where the ebony should of cracked shit ratio tragic
Lose sight suit oh mavericks clash at futility pageants
I post froze in a blaze at a grand combustion
A leader's deception connection wiper with a barn responds his friend
With an eye socket full of needles and a will to die for nothing
And that's glory abide thy crass itinerary barely suitable for common slum cats
And the lemmings will follow you to the blood bath
2 halves post made a dance evoked a whole lot of resentment
Build a pen around master dome patriarch close to four peters
Woke to rope cubicles combines with combines suitably ingenious
Let's soak my feet in lake infinity the time vibe strapped to dignity my symmetries vivid image still can't mimic the victory comfort is a drug and I'm numb as fuck
Yet some prefer the hum and others tend to suck the life out of the crux like
Drink the garbage split the homage reap the harvest target everyone
Mechanized idols that have a malleable colony till the fire ant dropped the sweet leaf grief your dreams a needle in a needle stack claiming safety pin physics
I'm sick of the picker the litter soaking the spot lit when I know they know they owe all thanks to the end all Aesop Rock shit watch this
No skull is sacred in the races
Locked in a pagan doctrine watching born again faces gamble up patience fail blatant
It's overlooking out crops. Give you one life to laugh at catalog bliss on the least common attachment 10 seconds of blaring silence pilot's flight redefine stagnant
Making that classic mockery of every step
The view from this here segue crowds a listeners nothing special simply
The uprooted turned moody and hacked pleasure to skinny ribbons and I'll suckle my skull caught beneath assumptions pumping pistons...
Dull and system missed the funk I'm in a lull
It could've been me but it wasn't
The crash and burn and burn and crash infected could collect fee indirectly but it doesn't
So I heard y'all wanna float...
Prime directive selects reflective aviation bathed in mood swing
How is you is the villain of my Kabuki hologram
We see intent to reinvent dream application with homage to ancients
Beached fish on the shores with a feast of wits eats the corpse
Divvy the servings and study the traits that deemed killer breed credible
I cook the wick at both ends just to blend that element of chance with my tight rope leaf
I alone personify mankind's collective soul
As the result of one angry Zeus fist blistering cult pulp evoked
Make it rain till the levy breaks
And it saddens me like televised casualties
I'll be hung in the village square in exactly five minutes
I've been soaking up my discontent regarding the equation
And I'm officially closed for consultation
The harvest appeared less plentiful than last season.
Then soon sacrificed lives to icicle jackets when the frost hit.
These minstrels turned the bully cycle civil by dissolving the candy coated image down to the pixels.
I guess I could spare a splash for a couple of heads.
These tense lips need soaking before I hand out tokens. shut the fuck up.
Black horse and buggy mechanism
Tucked the portion of my severed vision
The gathering of loose ends in a bucket
Wit a shoestring budget
I get awkwardly sturdy with a frigid liquid backbone
I get sprung with a vibrant alliance of clean intention
Now I'll attend the wedding of the open sore and festering
Now when the groom presents the ring
The bride commence to blistering
This textbook magnificently prude
Cabin fever meter pegging ludicrous
Beautiful cartoon trooper swallow Buddha futility with a teaspoon full of sugar
Then blame the stationary target while the prey escapes the frame
So I lay across the wood perpendicular to the grain
Warn the other brothers I was born forlorn
I'm a burn with this little light of mine
Alien of shallow alchemy
I'm floating the homing pigeon out hell's kitchen window
Left an SOS infested bottle nested in his grip so
With a prayer circle release party and hardy wild bellow
I observed him fly ten feet then drop the bottles to the
Fertile circle turn fertile crescent via bad investment
If I made an angel in the snow for every rotting victim
Sticky panoramic contaminant planet
In conjunction with phantom assumption
Just to help guide in your ship
To circle suns via folklore pollutants to rhyme strictly
From a BC generation disgust
Community movement alluding to a
Trying to build a fence around these magic beans my dreams have
I sell a barrel of spirit to dummy dimwit syndicate jackals
I don't really believe in God
It's like I hike an acre unimpressed
Sorta solo sheep amidst wolves
And still my shepherd can't administer the proper push and pulls
I push the ghouls to man overboard
Pull the bulls onto my sword
And buckle down in a corner chair with a round table floor
The recipe's design unplug the appetite for continuity
I peel back hearts and lodge Greek physics in the chambers
Enveloped in a mummy ribbon system
Blistering in a wishing well
Float or plummet 20 thousand cold leagues
My nourishment's provided in the summer
Hail dirty doll immaculate performance
Warm as the march of a billion torches forward to burn what I born at
Cut and paste alertness to current set is provided quick
I was riding on the yellow bus to where the brush thickens.
I'd rather take the time to burn every last bridge I've ever crossed beneath the sun
Breath too heavy to hold.
Ran for the sake of dead click stripped of idyllic image
Steal a sloppy earth meal feed my pottery wheel to model colossal vision
Honor and a loud thirst submersed in a trap
Little drummer boy vs. thunderclap
Adaption is the trap in which the artist meets the forest
Rendered me victim of deviltry plus wounded like stigmatics
Sick of same window different visual
Same agnostic hostage different ritual
Since then my knuckles haven't once dragged on the ground.
Adaption is the trap in which the artist meets the forest
To capture all the sides you sight
Magic tricks where skeptics sink
Waiting for a clock to punch
Wish I could breathe and stop for lunch
If I stop to count the leaves
On only one of these here trees
Not sure that I know what's pure
Born to kill the insecure
Some remain from start to end
Wear my heart on my short sleeves
From the roof I watch the street
And pray for those that's caught beneath
As long as I know right from wrong
As long as I know right from wrong
I dunno what I have to left
To give other than truth and breath
Angel when she shuts her eyes
Like we will leave to my demise
Between my time is short
About to start my last resort
Wake me up when it's time to make babies
Let emotions ruptured now
As long as I know right from wrong
As long as I know right from wrong
As long as I know right from wrong
I never felt pressure to have to justify my selfishness
At least not to your and yours
Maybe just my friends and fellowships
As long as the mood is somehow linked to my enhanced development
I swear they'll understand
There's a storm outside my tenement
Beats upon my windows with Mother Nature's adrenaline
I guess that's why my homey Blockhead stays glued to the television
Now I look less intelligent
Well it's warm by the filament
Huddled up close in the company of all my relatives
Cocooned in the unified efforts to all get settled in
Away from where the rain pours
Weed out the bums who practice migration under the elegant
Of course I realize the filtering procedure's delicate
But let devils inside to collide with your overzealousness
And fall to rock bottom
The urge could burst to turn even those hazardous to militant
You can't even have half of free second
The beat comes gelatin
Buried in merit badges
I'm stuck in the center and could care less
About the eye of the storm and its monstrous measurements
But it's better than risking life and limb to me
As long as I know right from wrong
As long as I know right from wrong
As long as I know right from wrong
As long as I know right from wrong
But if you pulling while I'm pushing
But if you pulling while I'm pushing
But if you pulling while I'm pushing
But if you pulling while I'm pushing
But if you pulling while I'm pushing
Fuck a sore channel changed digit
I sit with a nasty network intravenous plan
With a stable diet of my cable pirate
Born the bastard son of static radiance cloned to welcome in every home
Victim of the cursed nursed Technicolor drunk support team
Though accused by robot news casters who capture and pollute
Spoon fed hazardous fog to joy luck catholic squad
Turn my stilt into my guilt and have a chatter box blame frame adjacent station
Make reality scrambled and suck the life out of a hidden vandal
Let my clean spirit dissolve through the appliance
Deleted passions sacrificed to one electron monster
Crucify my lit up future to the monitor
Zoom in to hug the bug up in your family function
But the children seem to love it
And heard the static flock to where I sleep
By the glow of that magic box big speaker
Tangled in the star spangled wiring
And all the kings horses abort the loyalty to royalty
I'll be dead by morning anyway
Color my values with mundane humor in thirty minute tickets
To feel the magnetic seal picket censorship
I wanna shop from my bed and set an
And lurking circuitry circus
With allegiance pledged beyond the glass surface
Adamant students within the fine school of possessed graduate catalysts
Just let me hold the controller and I won't have to murder you
Twenty screens lined up along the borders of the maze
So I can get my two weeks notice every time the sun dance
Let a once divine soul feel the functions of the hypnotist
But I taste it everyday and bathe inside the consequences
Once is the resurrection of honorable function
Been shoveling a coal as the engine's doctor
Long enough to see my silhouette acquire a permanent kink in a posture
Cursed version of a certain Virgin Mary womb occupant
I know swamp rats who never suckled oxygen purification
Stuck until my friend leaves puppet for the plummet committee
Sputtering bum numb enough to stomach the city
Defeat a needle into battling to mute the mess
With patience galas with absentee balance I shove in the button
Strutting to exhibit mankind's hostility function
I top and ate my nameless square then I bumped eyelids
With a Christ we saw the same thing through a second
Nurse me through the time stick and stone mixes hex my fertile crescent
Just trying to keep my head above red tide despair
So every second the discontent's locked accordingly
Let's turn mummy's shut up affection a berserk glory condition
And pray for the day a star child tugs the ribbon
Credible crasser antidote's terrible taste the
Water with a stolen soul pen left picture mad rhythm pinned
Never set a grin and fly health
Consider me a mobile advertisement for that hybrid plan of fabrics
I feel a wind in my opinions plus hyper clutch
It's like the day the great oak met the saw mill
A lifeline of spectacular expansion leaves the reaper
At the hand of what man's hand jokes
I dream a book about my friends and still can't decipher the half
Cater to a king green battered on the brink of disease
Blow the pedals off a dandelion trying to make my little gypsy blush
And felt as if I'd actually accomplish something
Fortify the bullies of the jokes soaking in treatment
Sit and watch the percentages teeter on the evening
On a ghost up in a fuse a lot second before the cock dropped
In the Styx and stared him down until he fixed it
Casually note the blossom of phantom alignment strategy
I'll make the waterfall out of order in autumn saw the quarter
When the gods mimic the vintage knuckle drag sacked in a coffin
I affiliate my rag dummy appearance with a most cohesive spirit
Clattering the yesterday ain't shed a tear since
I'm swore to Adam and matter and saddling
Warhead thorax and abdomen to primitive horse back galloping
My index fingers rest in my talisman branded up in the jackals skin
Weaving graceful through the prom directed column
Bean stalk where the fiend walk and my name is mud
But that's got a ring to it so my soil welcomes the flood
I walk through God's practical joke on man practically broke
And if they raise my rent again I'll spend my nights practically soaked
I'll be that clear blue icicle that simply refused to melt
Skull of a thousand dilapidated dream remnants
Here to convict based on a tin bucket of evidence
But that cityscape makes me numb
Still managed to end up thirsty the day the nursery collapsed
In my hand I hold the plumage of a buzzard
I may have just saved your children
So I let my frigid demeanor teeter and take his vacant place
We three sprout from the same litter
Yet amazingly crafted by separate scissors
Half my time is herded toward little lost causes
I'm here to draw a fork in the road and call it the diary of common sheep aspiring
Little Billy star lit up the block got the right premise
Can't judge a man's dignity by the wattage in his stare
Pack up my belongings then it's off into the evening
Now I haven't exactly been embraced by the populace
Set sail upon the seven deadly seas of the anonymous
Pack up my belongings then it's off into the evening
My time to find a mile before the valley meets the hill
Where expectant slave smiles at the stick in the painted living
I'd place the button in the city square for everyone to push
You see my mission's responsibilities range across the board
And so I'd rather be a pen than a sword
Basic locomotive with a whistle and caboose
Packed up my belongings then it's off into the evening
I've knocked upon every little door that comes about
I'll sweep ya porch if you can spare a couple of breadcrumbs and a couch.
Pack up my belongings then it's off into the evening
This turning in my sleep is getting old and older still
I was sitting on my fire escape and I saw...
A vagabond begging for three pennies and a princess
A junkie tourniquet surgeon urging the needle in
I saw vandals catching tags and Puerto Rican flags
And then he sat down with his hammer and saw
I can see the roof garden on the apartment across the street
And kick myself because somewhere along the way I lost my seeds
A black man with a horn and a will to make you sit and listen to
A universe of brick buildings slightly off balance
Raise my mighty mallet towards the gods and swing my talents
I see a crack in the sidewalk
Sitting inside bent meridian
Spraying yellow beams above yellow back dreams
And children in the hydrants
The wall to the glamor standard
A bus stop of commuters waiting to have their souls towed off to
I seen the slap dash habits of bike messengers paws
A carnival amusement park where a heart is a luxury
I see a gas galaxy huddled behind those pearly doors
My experience with a spirit alignment interference assigns division from clearance to ample scrambling.
Let's note the magnificence in the difference.
Every clan ghostly orphan scared stiff in the bliss and list picking from the arrangement under burden. Bust.
Pitching a battered platform out of mass hysterics perished in the blizzard. When it's finished I plan to sit and observe the twister pivot.
Spare a match for the most distorted orchid in the path.
Assorted orphans coursed in a morbid orbit forward toward the traps.
I make a tentative promise to flash frequent the most sacred abrasive based in allegiance to the makeshift mason's secrets.
The simple triple ring performance shoveled subtle imperfection.
I rung a life's worth of saturated costume gear over hell's balcony to nullify the drought and still the martyr farmers shout at me.
And so the epic went.
And every cirrus hung.
My plan is dwindling with every pulse bump. Gods and monsters yield the lump sum of the dolt clump.
Be wary when the stratosphere tints.
Now cause to amend the Zen memorandum has surfaced in every holocaust citadel fix it plan.
12 easy steps to better picket line demeanor.
Stick stone conglomerate activate massive.
I've hired sweatshop labor to hold candles to the solar panels stitched in the back of my neck for nickels and sour milk by the week.
Cheek to the heartache.
At the center of my anthem lies a blend of temper tantrums substantial for me to lamp in.
I was born where crooked demeanor seemed to spawn merit
I was born where all the kings man couldn't mend a broken spirit
I was born where no matter if you stand sit or fall to live or die as a brick brick brick in the wall
Every little step we take breaks the dreams
Yeah yeah I rap tight like Saran
I treat MC like canines
I told you my poetry sponsors Gillette
The sticker in my hand would say priority seating
If we could absorb every star in the sky
And we know the differences between the walkers and the sleepers
I boogie with picketer vision
Carbon based stickler
Itching to pigeon hole villain soul magnet
Passion ate the germ and the book met the worm
I know a crossbreed strung well in the key of mass times weight times tamed semantics encompassing that which splits lips but never supplied the bandage
Sluggish posture just won't cut it.
Where the witches are fireproof and every preacher's a madman.
When they pause to polish they fins.
The better brains will preach the village through the city square
Slept with sticks and stones in my pillowcase.
Had that phase when the devil tree contacts a sparkle in my eye.
Salvage all priorities and iron out all kinks.
Your domain and you must treat it well.
Keep it clean or it'll swallow you whole.
Try it again. Little bit more juice this time.
Try it again. Yeah a little bit more elbow grease this time.
My sincere addiction imbalance stems from a vintage grimace slap to the mug of
Ancestral branch camped on the vessels.
With the exception of pleasant finale binges on the great endangered interests
Of phantom brigades slaving to save that princess.
With magnified magnanimous appearance sandy sinners in opinion shut.
Consumer populace feed but never dreamed of the process
And drips from the ceiling and smells the rich scent of my tracks.
See it ain't the vision it's the plot that makes me stop.
Try it again. I don't want to.
Try it one more time.
Sulking and bulking a half
Sulking a laugh crash test
Figure the mixtures digging up his last breath
My frame reportedly spotted garden variety burners and lost to normalcy
Autograph dirty catapult sponges my hunches hurling murder abundant lunches with the
Product well its drenched in a barren backward wasteland of shimmering moral tension
Voodoo dolls and 99 dreams later the shooting gallery wall it's like not a wave crash
Similar to last or next heckle me not already doctored by regrets gray rain
Comma to grasp it I left my crutch over the rainbow with my riches and I know the rat
Good condition but I'm still fishing the same worm from the same faulty position
That a line so gray will last forever more dusting off the dreams to be an autopilot
Still a silent understudy funny how the opposite will throttle and the different
Wanna I just wanna I just wanna be a general he said I just wanna sleep yo what a
Excuse to decorate maps with thumb tacks this gold star product pushing hate boogie
Themes enter the smoke screen blazing saddle remnants alive analyze pensive connect
All picket fences like chain gangs linked digging trenches to candy land image
Factory sold ah I wanna be an astronaut I got the merits and heart and I bought a
Starship with hard earned money from one hour selling dreams to dummies when they
Leash like organ grinder primates dancing for bread crumbs well did you touch that
Slugger banging on the table with an old tin cup thin luck I can raise the dead when
The shark settlers fled the place sprung out they bed of nails to spread the sails
You why this globe tilts
Take me where the air is clear I don't really know where but I know it's not here and
I love New York Saturdays
But Mondays last longer
And since I plan to live a long life
Maybe I'll serve a thousand Mondays and swallow the burn
To merge the week for all its got
And it's nothing short of ferocious but I swallowed the dosage
And my candle is a flame that burns to symbolize the day Gretel met Hansel
Then I settle in a stand still
I live forever reaching for the sun
Hoping some lucky day I'll clutch and get a hand full
The way my gypsy dances makes a monster retreat to fetal
I never felt so damn young
But you don't look a day over zero
I never really knew the true definition of precious
Till my angel wit the beautiful red locks gave it a message
I'm a fully animated life tree
See the root of the mute button was dug up bug up on a song
Of I'm a fully animated life tree
With branches for the heavens to admire actually
We all know what a halo is
But we all don't know the horrors if your halo tips
I be the Sword in the Stone of the contemporary eclipse
I'm incredibly exhausted
Freedom freedom freedom fighter beginning
Every little steps you take breaks the chamber
I ain't been around the world but I been around the block
I ain't seen everything but I seen enough to talk
I'm just a mason with a will to build and a little advice
Villain with a theme dream silent
I make a true spur of the moment grown decision
Which in turn allows me to be something normal
With the prefix of the abbot
This is not your ordinary ballad
With a perfect little bow around the middle
And a black man on a white horse
Or a white man on a black horse
It's got all these tired parts where
We don't even sing at random
We don't serve your kind
It ends where it begins
And the beginning isn't pretty
And it goes a little something like this...
The zealots enveloped inside the belly of the blame
I bought up silkworms by the bucket like starter kits
So you first bought a stitch
Joined damaged mammoth brigading caper
Nurse the tantrum with a fantasy chaser
I keep the spare wings strapped to my fuses
In case the hackers snatch the plumage
So you mean these things are worth money
See I sanitize nothing for the sake of contemporary taste
The sickness likeness in the roofer's eyes and his alone
And nothing terrible happened to the bag
And brought on out...
Suppose it's noise...
Sky and dirt that's fresh... kept
From where I'm going... holy other
I've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart
I've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart
That was to be in vain
Where the junkies trade diseases and the gullible trade passions
This is not your ordinary ballad
With a perfect little bow around the middle
And a black man on a white horse
Or a white man on a black horse
No more pencils no more books
I built the city out one brick
I had a mayor and a crook
I made the crook stab the mayor then slay himself in the guilt
I'll bring the butterflies and he can bring the centipedes
The devil tree penciled me in but I slept thick through my alarm sock
Slick Willy hid in the barn while farmer charmed the crops
My tongue is full of glass
Because I promised my friend I'd chew up the bottle
If he truly drank the poison
We can manufacture medicine
Let me slay artists for tips in the penny tray
By the way if that diamond ring don't shine
The air's rooted in carbon
I'm but a mortal archer parked in amber waves of starlets
Let a tug of the puppeteer steer my hustle
But when the catapult releases lease your claims behind the bunker
Is it genuine enough to feel baby felon
How's this my little loom
Now y'all ain't excused from table side
Till the dinner plates fly
Mimic stitch and splinter entry
Cats know the ambiance calm beyond comparison
I'm trying to give this city acupuncture
See every now and again I love life but hate to admit it
Cause it spreads the jinx on a sleeping cynic
I'm quadruple six plus scruples category mayhem stems
So one overlooked the scene including loopholes
When Christ studies the return ramifications
I'll burn the campus to impress him
You ran the final mile before the blanks blow
Just to numb and then shimmy the needles loose
Plus jokers with an image
Modern theory jars us while remaining harnessed to the vintage
I'm mad at how far this is dishonoring Occam's Razor
I've patched the little leakage in the shell around my greed
In case Tommy Turbulence located the matrix then impedes
This is labor labor labor labor
Who put the monkey wrench in well oiled perfectionist emblem
Just to watch these monitors spit white noise
Through your office space automate
I infect knowledge gene pool dissented cloud clusters
And pause somewhere in the middle for slick invention
This years brain crop spread spectacular
I twist characters like twist characters
Talley up the alley cat aggression
Working these war picked ciphers
With head striker stability and kamikaze chivalry
I alone noble in a worm food feud
Walking dead generation ain't nobody asking for your patience
The grand opening holding me to face the fact
That I knew myself and didn't have to ask nobody else
Searching for pertinent verse minus the murderous diversions
Apologies won't lore me to the communal sob story
Nor would I sacrifice lifestyle to benefit jury temperament
To watch them fed to one disgruntled crack at the high noon
And start warriors vs. baseball fury element
To glitches motor sensory development
With a one way ticket to Beat Street
This soil is like relevant to human concept
I walk the block with a halo on a stick poking your patience
Y'all catch a thirty second flash visual
Fathom the splicing of first generation
Duke of early retirement picket dream
American nightmare hogging the screen
I'll hold the door open so you can stumble in
Merit crutched on the wretched refuse of my teaming resonance
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when the buzzards drag your brother's flags to rags
And I'll hang my boots to rest when I'm impressed
This origami dream is beautiful
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
Slacker bound intimate tabloid headline with a pulse
Divvy crumbs for the better souls
When seven deadly stains adhere to blame to crystal conscience
Plug deteriorating Zen up in pen dragon
Before the badge gleam sparkled in my brick wall windows
Another thick installment of one night in Gotham
Attached to the festive batch of city goblins
Sorta similar to most backbones at camp Icarus
Where all fiddler crabs congregate and get pampered for bickering
Or maybe you're just an asshole who couldn't sweet talk the princess
Stomach full of halo kibbles
Wingspan cast black upon vigils
Hear to duck hunt ticker tape vision and pick apart the pixels
I got a friend of polar nature and it's all peace
You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
This cat is asking if I seen his little lost passions
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
Fronted by the Hail Mary parry lunge mixer
Its bob and weave amalgam played the falcon to your fixture
Slightly foul Gershwin
I be the now observatory eye ear antenna feeler
Until the day I die from grimace overload
Treatment offered by the weekend
I drag a yellow taxi meter behind every measure
And charge cats for labeling me shepherd
And I don't comment if you formulate a weak Zen.
All I ever really wanted was a getaway
I can not agree to follow a leader while on the borderline
A war without a reason for the Brady hates gore
Kill the ones that speak from a different life
Live by the icy cold hand of bad intention youth blender
Oh yeah I'll let God warm the bench for now but
I'll ascend to spin y'all dizzy
But can't see past the loophole
Of Aesop Rock's twelve steps to shut the fuck up seminar
Serenity's a crack whore
Raw caricature of mayhem standard branded by the labor
With a thousand reasons to end this for every one of you saviors
Saw the brightest burst ironically wide from the vacant stage
Gave it a pound for burning where bunk ratio's engaged
Keep me posted as to when you grasp something mature to
Escaped briefly back to my apartment
I parked in front the fan
And reminisce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my
Free game piece all included
I told this cat the earth was flat
He walked till his beard grew long enough to strangle himself
Spliced with that sixth pack odyssey
My feelings spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings
While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
From the alpha to the zed
I bake the date up for my pledge
Mummified mannequins with future cleanse adamant
And skeleton in cabinet
Just big enough to shove my purpose in a circle
I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew
I lay the law down upon its belly
With my foot dug in between the third and fourth disk
I'm the actualized data commission
Past penny tip jar donation arrangement
Took a heart pledge early on
To sketch up out your future
I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down sand
Land of the free base
Home of the triplicate grill character
My sorta sideways tilt called pinball blinker
I rock a crooked lid piece
Pacifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed
Sucked the proverbial silver spoon to the parents quit
You can catch the memoir in several dimensions
I didn't mean to cause all that destruction
Lucy was 7 and wore a head of blue barrettes
Had a piece of yellow chalk with which she'd draw upon the street
The many faces of the various locals that she would meet
Who always took her milk money at the morning bus stop
She always gave a wave and holler on her weekly trip down to the bingo parlor
Now all the other children living in or near her building
You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream
Basement apartment in the same building she grew up in
She traded in her blue barrettes for long locks held up with a clip
Traded in her yellow chalk for charcoal sticks
Lucy had very little contact with the folks outside her cubicle day
They would only see each other once or twice a week on purpose
They appreciated space and Rico was an artist too
So they'd connect on Saturdays to share the pictures that they drew
And they would make a weird face the second the door shut
And run and tell their friends how truly crazy Lucy was
She'd paint another masterpiece
Traded in the locks and clip for a head rest
Had a television in the room that she'd never turned on
Lucy pinned up a life's worth of pictures on the wall
And sat and smiled and looked each one over just to laugh at it all
She'd never spoken much throughout the spanning of her life
I knew what I wanted and did it till it was done
And Lucy blew a kiss to each one of her pictures and she died.
I could walk with a limp and make your step feel incomplete
Note at the craft work door the last smirk of the the Damien mainframe
My box cost siphon third rail juice from lost poets
Don't bargain at martyr parliament rallies
Towards the nursery class act impression of a bubble
Man huddles make us look like cool peeps and I'm trying to school sheep
Plantation shut this picket fence
Let alone sip the mission long enough to listen
Now I'm gonna roll this question tight and smoke that shit up in your face
Now if you were to alter masks every time fame circus approaches
Mothering stickler cabin and madden shit
I seen guys harbor bad shiners
Then wonder why the culprits sitting at the their rainbows ending
Hollering wolves in the form of one frustrated culprit
But a love tap full of washed up stardom melted trying to milk it
Laughter bats that hung from my rafters
But I ain't about to say that I'm the only cat you got bubbling
It's all cotton candy when Aesop Rock the B light
Oh and for the record I've been rhyming since me and Andre thought we could freestyle
Dismissed it as casually non compatible and bounced
Obtained status where I could straight objectively critique your after projects like
Now like were both trying to sit and breath another dawn so my advice
I've been a biplane dog fighter Henson invention
I sit back five dimensions
Only to muscle the overcooked specimen
Fending tragic fatality successful dodging violets
All hail Mary and hello dollies
Saw the wicked war phantom mansion beyond the pickets
Y'all hesitate to fetch it
I was walking through a pinball tilt built landscape
I bite the bullet in a wingspan shadow
Suck and rust the oxygen gulps
And spit the metal directly back up the barrel
Dancing past the foggy mirror
I'm at six degrees of sexy sarcasm
Under the bed backwards bastard
I'm not a name to keep at arms length
Adjacent to little lattice quilt makeshift
No it will not help you shove your Lincoln
I alone peddle in the mud
I alone stand in a social coma
I alone peddle in the mud
I alone stand in a social coma
Well he was maverick enough but still scraped up
Without a care inside from posting the roster
This nervous twitch mark the most delectable ingredient
I'd rather find the floors and watch you hide them
Blasting clear out the back of this batches sour wind collection
A goddamn four string criminal trading card
The reason they decorate the fonts of closing credits
Challenge thirty balance
I alone pour talent while they fidget
I alone peddle in the mud
I alone stand in a social coma
I alone peddle in the mud
I alone stand in a social coma
Where the stench of commuter briefcase replaces a bad sleep
Training Generation Fallout
Waterfall bricklayer pincushion crawl out
There's smoke in my iris
But I painted a sunny day on the insides of my eyelids
I'm ready for life in this city
And my wings have grown almost enough to lift me
I'm a dinosaur with Jones Beach in my hourglass
Don't tell me Lucifer and God don't carpool
I'm not trying to graduate to life with a personalized barstool
My name stands for my being
And my being stands for the woman who stood
And braved the storm to raise this seedling
Yeah middle sibling suitable but far from son of excellence
Saw the liquid dreams of a thousand babies solidify
And picked the rose that wilted
The second I introduced myself as Nervous
Well it appears the scars of learning have spoken
Some are just a brutal repercussion of devotion
Now where I live there's a homeless man
He makes a rusty trumpet sound like the music that angels make
Tell him Aesop Rock sent ya just to hear his horn blow like this
And I ain't getting any younger
My knuckles wear their bruises well
I've yet to lose that hunger
But only time can tell
Prodigal Son with a prodigal wish to sew that prodigal stitch
See your name is Ambiguity
My name is something hands can't hold
It's like sketching a circle in the dirt with a pointed stick
And if I plow the fields that don't guarantee plentiful harvest
Idols block survival crops the cycle stops for nothing
The Bible's carp revivalist winos flock by the hundreds
But y'all numb from gut fuel
Channel surfing my way to the top
With no holes poked in the nozzle
Till that rookie boogie graduated hostile
And the vehicle is grandeur and it veered over the median
I was born bound to a stencil called symmetry
But my energy's a rental
So I take this now to say
Thank you senorita for holding a flame to a lost wick
Y'all are family for life
I'll take that bullet to preserve you
I wanna be something spectacular
Attach my fashion to the casualties of anarchy
Save my nickels up to buy that homeless man a brand new horn
Then sit up on his crate as a witness to beauty born like this
While bent funny bone grown community
Spit a thousand and 1 ripples to cripple the continuity
Tap water builds character
Right I irrigate it straight to mainline
These pretty profit grommet teams solidify the clot to slippery city salt piston pump drain
Where everyday a thousand strangers pray for empty chambers
Five Sixths sweat bullets trying to keep it subtle
Broke inches tired of dry land
Till he try and fidgets with his or her own worst fear specifics
Swerve around the cobra kisses
See if the venom overloads this vision
I'm going to suck the poison out and spit it
Stole my sneakers but your feet just never fit in
Servers you right for trying to walk a mile outside your limits
It goes boom boom boom
Bliss is down a point
Still crawling out of bed at 2 on Saturdays
Let the back burner boiling point descend
Strike personal space with the most utterly putrid version of grace
While we try and jump through hoops
Want to be a fighter pilot
Driving that childish early Wright brothers experiment
Prototypic model fossil
Sit and sweat bullets on a console
Busting accidental dirt bike donuts
Outside the most ridiculous poison tongue brain silo
Schooled by the cruel intention inventions pensive sideshow
See contrary to popular certainty
I alone advance without an earthly poem
And dance on a handful of zoning fans
Holding every chance to own the land I roam
Truly be its only camper happy with the scrap heap
See I convinced myself it's on
Therefore it is and the melody settles
Beneath the fact that I'm just spitting for these kids
I tried to get them all open
And once I quit and said I didn't care
I swear they all threw their hands up in the air
It goes boom boom boom
I understand the plagues and while they shake hands with my grimace
Let's question the ascension of a broken social icon in various domino affects
With no alibi love is used as a guide by the civilized
Some see it as the body heat you feel when you close your eyes
As the truth hits your ears begin to cry
City lights look bright groups of fireflies
Spit sparks speak to the streets
The skid marks are replies
Read discussions of what we rode through entrenched in the vocals
Physically the situation's hard to stop
I had a wicked jump shot and sold crack rock on back blocks
Sometimes I feel the rats got a better deal than I do.
Punks that buckle under the rumble of my drum
Steadily searching for something new under the sun
Punks that buckle under the rumble of my drum
Steadily searching for something new under the sun
The train car used to be my apartment
Don't get worried now
We've been in a cold world
It's delicate demeanor and I teach you how to hang
Dear obedience I apologize for the faulty academics
But they placed us in a miserable stasis
I let bygones be bygones
Just ain't working the way the manual paints it
See I soak in a blue note factory
While most cats hassle bandits lamping solo
And when the last red brick topples over the earth
To intercept your crooked little mess
I can be found in a social coma directly to your left
Regarding how to document the shady baby steps
I bounce checks like a modern man
Sleep with one eye open while the other two drift
Together specimens from the promised land
This for that cat at my shows that's always got prophetic opinions
But can't remember where his drink is.
Are you a memorable troop or just a lab rat on the run
I wrote the book that shook America to splinters
In a winter wasteland
Or Baron Münchhausen proud gimps to clinch this chemical
Well beneath your holiday
Beached on a red tide infested shore corroding eastern seaboard
It's like a bleeding comet bombing on your sequels
Carbon based pardons ain't enough
My stilts truly personify the urbanite flea circus
I catapult brain opera past basic
Diabolic Prodigal Son spill grimace
Which explains missing the premise
I deal with tangible goods
And avoid manufacturing food for landfills
I've seen friends bow to needles
I've seen needles bow to records
I've seen boughs break
I've seen God bow and make the clouds shake
I've seen the proud break
Who tattooed the city scape up skin to blend in
Had a hatchet slice for camps
Starving your style to someday be a story of my kids
Life's everything in between
Life's Peachy like James and the Giant
That's the way it goes though...
Maybe I should just give up or stop trying
I've got to keep on searching
I'm here to scrape a car clean to the funk machine
Imposes on the underling amalgam clustering identifies the
I hate to tell you but it skips more than it palpitates
Like these here drunken little archers missed more than they
The falcon hates the mockingbird
To be your lawfully wedded head trip
Christmas with a shallow stocking
You drop science like Don Herbert with liquor in him
How I can build while you just sit there and bitch about your
Zoom in to the fuming of an aggravated breed
Half the patients waste themselves prior to Commencement
This old Pompeii impression sways infection in twelve steps or less
Martyrs talk funny causes into harvesting Spartacus and so on
When the clock strikes nine I'll be waking with the best of routine caffeine team players for the cycle of it
I'll take my seat top of the Brooklyn Bridge with a Coke and a bag of chips
To watch a thousand lemmings plummet just because the first one slipped
I tend to underestimate my average
Just another bastard savage
Now we the American working population
Hate the fact that eight hours a day
Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us
And we may not hate our jobs
But we hate jobs in general
That don't have to do with fighting our own causes
We the American working population
When we'd rather be supporting ourselves
By being paid to perfect the pastimes
That we have harbored based solely on the fact
That it makes us smile if it sounds dope
It's the year of the silkworm
Everything I built burned yesterday
Let's display the purpose that these stilts serve
Elevate the spreading of the silk germ
Trying to weave a web but all I in believe in is dead
It's the year of the jackal
Saddle up on high horse
My torch forced Polaris embarrassed
Shackle up the hassle by the doom and legend marriage
I bought some new sneakers I just hope my legacy matches
It's the year of the land shark
They're out there being slaughtered in meaningless wars so you don't have to bother
And can sit and soak the idiot box trying to fuck their daughters
Man it's the year of the Orphan
Seated adjacent to the fireflies circling the torches on your porches
Trying to guard the fortress of a king they've never seen or met
But all are trained to murder at the first sign of a threat
Maybe it's the year of the water bug
Fury spawned dreaming of your next of kin
I'm still dealing with this mess I'm in
I've been the object of your ridicule
You've been a bitch lieutenant
It's the year of the underpaid employee
Spitting forty plus a week
And trying to rape earth on my off time
So you can't run run run
We the American working population
Hate the fact that eight hours a day
Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us
And we may not hate our jobs
But we hate jobs in general
That don't have to do with fighting our own causes
We the American working population
But we'd rather be supporting ourselves
By being paid to perfect the pastimes
That we have harbored based solely on the fact
That it makes us smile if it sounds dope
Pour myself a cup of ambition and
Yawn and stretch and my life is a mess and
Pour myself a cup of ambition and
Yawn and stretch and my life is a mess and
I don't budge the motives encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas
My kitchen sink leaks like you're itching to speak a secret
His beaming smile knew a private agony that burns
And when the children met divinity I sat to watch them merge
It goes pandemonium live
And a basket case is in a classless matrix with elastic stitches
Short of breath like you're short of fresh
You're a portable mess
Trying to dismiss those pioneering their fortunes
You touched the hand of God and I'm like
You got your life in a basket before you could say instant classic
Like the king of the mountain requires a boost
I'll bury the hook in my belly just to volunteer at Live Aid clinics
Prominent ghost town litigant battle pitch darkness when the light switch hits the artistry circuit board breaker
Service in the greater half of nature
See money go wild shook when the exploitation incubated lovely
Numb enough to deny the sin pins and evil needles even punctured
Till he won't define his turn and can still function
I don't budge the motives encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas
Soaking in bulk on a sofa with duct tape upholstery
Dirty doc stellar space medic
Stoned by the commoners for glowing
Happy trail hitchhikers guide to spanning oblivion
Complete with a thankless 9-5 chapter
You can sign your life after the facts
Sandman here to foreshadow a day when televisions run over baboon heart transplants
Sketching a glass partially empty till their hand cramps
With a iceman's dance if that ain't streamlined and stand with a fan's lamp
I mean absorbing attention's a must
You don't wanna be overlooked
Yeah but you don't wanna be looked over too much
One up for the dashed hopes of fifty fishermen who crashed boats
And the angels who never hit a bad note when harmonizing
I'm an armor plated farmer
I'm an archer rising with a drawn bow for the karma where the bulls eye clings and argues
Recognize your life is merely bait for bigger fish
I don't budge the motives encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas
I walk the block with a halo on a stick poking your patience
Y'all catch a thirty second flash visual
Fathom the splicing of first generation
Duke of early retirement picket dream
American nightmare hogging the screen
I'll hold the door open so you can stumble in
Merit crutched on the wretched refuse of my teaming resonance
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when the buzzards drag your brother's flags to rags
And I'll hang my boots to rest when I'm impressed
This origami dream is beautiful
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
Slacker bound intimate tabloid headline with a pulse
Divvy crumbs for the better souls
When seven deadly stains adhere to blame to crystal conscience
Plug deteriorating Zen up in pen dragon
Before the badge gleam sparkled in my brick wall windows
Another thick installment of one night in Gotham
Attached to the festive batch of city goblins
Sorta similar to most backbones at camp Icarus
Where all fiddler crabs congregate and get pampered for bickering
Or maybe you're just an asshole who couldn't sweet talk the princess
Stomach full of halo kibbles
Wingspan cast black upon vigils
Hear to duck hunt ticker tape vision and pick apart the pixels
I got a friend of polar nature and it's all peace
You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
This cat is asking if I seen his little lost passions
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
I paced my game to zero hour completion
American nightmare lost in the monitor
I'll hold the door open so you can stagger through
Noise crutch stolen wretched refuse of my teeming dumb luck
Still I promise temperance storm breed still bleeding Amish
See the freaks sucked out the wattage while 3 bears invade the cottage
And I can't sleep now
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when you're hosted by the ghost of Christmas past
You won't be laughing when your blow up doll's
Got a headache and won't give up the ass
And I lay my kicks to rest when I'm impressed
But you really can't do a thing with that
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Swallow up the pieces
Beached in the city of lost barnacles and leeches
I'm pretty sure I got a pulse... plus
With seven deadly stains
To hear the plane to crystal conscious
Set a course then push the button
I swallow spores born by the laws of a morbid glutton
I can spot a duck battalion by the Charlie Chaplin waddle
Another thick installment of one night in Gotham like
I'll try to meet the wizard
Who keeps the villagers circling the marketplace
Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests
Stomach full of diner food
Wings span cast black upon views
Here to help release the rabid hounds or pick apart your mood
I got this friend of polar nature and it's all peace
When I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
This cat is asking if I've seen his little lost passions
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Swallow up the pieces
Walk into the store with a pocket full of nickels
The alley cats manipulate the blocks with gutter magic
Today my heart beats only out of habit
Said he could spit it with pinpoint accuracy if there was beef
So now I keep a jackal under my tongue to spit with related reasoning
The earthworm turbulent murder burnout Gerber baby no brain or memoir stardom
Robert Crumb ugly dumb image
Barely sprung barely no grimace
Spy with a millipede pentagon pirate
It's the theme park I built
I'm writing a petition to have smoking as a sport
Operation capture flag by any means
Walk into the store with a pocket full of nickels
Walk into the store with a pocket full of nickels
And a city full of World Trade Center victim candle vigils
There's a single Spanish female out west traveling the country
Neighborhood watch weasels pacing ugly acres more than often
Cloud 9 egos from my corner office
I toss a nickel to a bum's cup from twenty paces thumbs up
Got twenty ways to tell you shut the fuck up
And an electronic daddy long legs stay grimy up in your zoning wall
That's when life's pleasures were simple
Now it takes a dancing bear jumping through flaming hoops
Though shall not desecrate the soothing spiral
Altered by a classic cut to vinyl
I'll light the pyramid shaped torso
Now if you got a lock and gas mask outside of your own apartment
Walk into the store with a pocket full of nickels
In a city where every crack in the sidewalk's a symbol
Where there's crack whores and corrupt pigs killing cats trying to crack cases
I got a poltergeist on a leash trained by Caroline herself
Two Thousand something...
Technology aid itself glutton
It's Vietnam in the fumes
Yes I run with cannibals that bite the hand
But it also helps to fuck up a couple of sacred friendships
Watch a six legged insect crawl out of the billy goat beard
Watch a sick makeshift bitch threat fall out when the filthy smoke clears
Watch the insect's stinger sting threat till it has sweat a bullet
You're the kind of cat that rolls a pimped out Caddy
I wanna rap a lot and stack cheddar by the fistful
I spit with an immense amount of power
Storm clouds that indicate the acid rain hours
I'll make a sad fan appreciate rap again
And take flight with the weight of the world on my shoulders
And blame David Blaine on any chains that hold us
Crews into food in hopes to satisfy my
Insatiable appetite to dine on lifeforms
Small planets and satellites
You solar system is my condiment
Every dog has his day and even more so in rhyming
Cats don't really fall off they just get uninspired
I'll drop a ill LP and disappear like Bobby Fischer
Determined not to let time slip
Determined not to let time slip
Served and centerpiece
From her fatal wrist cuts story I'll respect you
Greed even are lease screaming with milestone like ring ring
Welcome to a clouds swell blew to hallucination war pillar
I dash like a jack rabbit that orbits revelation with a single
This is that mighty case of home field advantage to bend your
A crocodile smile and fight robot knuckles to your kisser
Determined not to let time slip
Hey yo must not sleep
I bash the bracket open and breach
Majority's cordially aboard the pinnacle benders
While cop walkie talkies walk outside my apartment obnoxious
Tonight's special consists of stale fiber from shitty diners
Student first pedagogue only from brazen action
Wind blown mariner east river shark carry lunge carry funk ends on caliber
Watch war face painted junkies dance blissfully around a bonfire and
Probably the same motherfuckers that buffed the train
Must bash the bracket
Must slash the fabric
Roll into the city with one half of the cannibals.
I'm son of a stubborn old one track jackal prince
Ate the city spit the bricks ate the boxcar spit the burners
Ate the planet spit the murder
Funny farm rampage from writing rap for milk money built ugly
Till the following morning Colombo found a crown of thorns in urine puddles
I'm not trying to save the world I'd rather watch it die slow
Yup. Step to the carnies
Try to win a teddy bear to impress your favorite Barbie
She almost sucked you off at the company Christmas party
But she won't accept the bear till Aesop signs it with a sharpie
I check myself in television rehab
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
Must bash the bracket
Must slash the fabric
This is the hot tin roof stepper
Hold it down with centipede foundation
Mr. Greed who burns rugged obstruction in bunches
Like little Jackie paper puffs the magic dragon and dutches
Aesop Rock smashed the pumpkin
When the wrist slit it leaks out only the bloodiest bubble letters
For vagrant colonies to follow in redeeming bottles
Sorry to offend but sometimes life bends in the middle
So now you have a fulcrum where there used to be a pillar
And now I got no 9 to 5 and still labor days flicker
Now go do your homework
Count that for me... thanks
Well any asshole with a book of matches can light a fire fresh
Then scurry up the grass to roll his marbles off the anthill
I know girth and good nature but recognize absentee ballots
And sappy ballads couldn't fill the void
I'll find my own bullies to shake a finger wrapped in
Realigned mine eyes in divine justice
Plus this uncontrollable laugh with those amber waves of brain finally crash
Brimstone clone with legs and dim poems
Ten little Zen crafts
Things cooperate like paper doll participant litigants
Picket well or ride a burner style clinic
I want to be the halo that jumps off the brain
Of the genius who decided some pictures deserved frames
Interrupting a devil pageant
I keep my ghoul spirit concealed
My momma told me there'd be days like this
I walk a mile with a leash attached to your freak seminar
It's a modern sensation on the boulevards of maintenance
To sweep your broken hopes under the rug then hug the playpen
This revolution pushing through the loose pins
They had him parallel with a tattered glory division
That got my paper crane's wings wet
I dance with chuckles while you man the keyhole grilling post
I've done my chores according to God's schedule
With coffee holding the wheel and nicotine working the pedals
Metal edged canes that tends to repel the bevel
Kettle screeching out the operetta
I live to autograph the iron curtain with dove's back feather pens
For the tenants lacking arms to harbor the rarity of thick friendship
Chained to fatigued ankle
Leagues beneath the angle
This was originally not for public consumption
This was made for four people...
Four people that literally saved my life
They know who they are...
I don't think this song would pay for them.
It'll push the thank you a little further...
Before Graham and after Chris... OK.
To the cold hard concrete on mere bodega trips
Rose rapidly out a bog I'd never fished in.
But the symptoms rejected my caveman Modus Operandi.
Made even the slightest fragment of sense to me.
I literally feel like I'm teetering on the blunt edge of my sanity.
But you lent a heart and hand that only you could.
But that didn't ever bother you.
Letting me know I wasn't the only one with this.
Talked me through repair of a head full of broken pistons.
But I could tell you that I only write shit down when I believe it.
Never faced a monster like the last few months ever in my whole life...
But the pieces won't formulate it to anything even close to cohesive.
Four soldiers that extended something sacred off the purity of kindness.
I owe you all my life and please don't argue with that statement.
I wish I could explain this better.
I'm sorry for burdening your pleasures.
Just gotta figure this all out... So...
How one man can literally buckle under the same pressures
Other men operate normally under.
I am lucky enough to have those people around me.
Thank you for helping me to not die.
Thank you for helping me to not die.
Armadillo armor that bends around the blades
Bazooka in the tooth that he's flashing at your friends
Know and sip the recipe
Not a single innocuous side up in the centerpiece
Journalists across the globe are officially critiquing my first eight bars
Like jousting Pompeii with a garden hose
If you wake up to the sound of helicopters bumping Wagner
Buckle in the Bronx back alley batting cage with bottle smacks
Decrepit sickly dogs get shot behind the barn
One shan't put in long hours like Tim Leary's lava lamps
To be second headlined under the boy born with lobster hands
First nocturnally orchestrated car alarms
Got rebel camps with siphons amped to cookie cut the wattage
Condition the bodega rodent moment composure
Last catapult standing in a land of coke and hookers
He's making paper dolls decorated with targets
He's labeling the dolls with the names of shitty rap artists
I ordered a hovercraft off the back page of an Archie comic
My friend jumped off the Empire State Building while I hung with 10th grade head cases
Threading the iris of the needle. just for my people
Raise roofs in a glass
Operate wild by the company of unturned stones and litter
Talk his way out of a sunburn and be home in time for dinner
Stalking awkward with a zip lock on the pill hole
Sofa cobra shimmy out crater
Cradle my weight in double wishbone suspension
Versus AM clock radio bangers
Downside up in cripple acres and still the fountainhead
You could be a part of it
Just park your bark at 20 paces
Hold this target and we'll call this bitch a partnership
Little Lego people squeezing little Lego Polaroid in keyhole
Media breather needy burrow to hide all
While you friends and neighbors press stethoscopes to the drywall
Lamb choppy sock puppet fear and loathing
So I read Aesop interviews and get schooled on my own motives
Parking meters when the pigs blew the whistles like windmills
I went to jail overnight for putting a sticker on a phone booth
Now in the time that you did the paperwork
Panicky banister silver surf over the wobbles where the potholes
Be the ulcer in the stomach of the God show
You blinded by the light you might just plummet through the cosmos
Meet Apollo sandman function before the whore hit the high note
And when the freaks come out I hug a TV
Repeat with a twist... Easy
Now listen to this... oh OK
I hug a hammock in the bedlam
I'll wake up for a second to help the betters count their blessings
For the long term got a dragon all achy
Torn between the lending of a helping five knuckles
And a charter your own escape
Slave pain cave children game
My radio is on regardless
I tune out pardons and tune in starlets
Who walks on all fours dragging the cadaver of King Midas
Documentation of the rate at which narrow tapers
And still get the security deposit back
Hold your head cold winter
He makes records with his tongue in the dirt
Suffer the dirty earth crisis with a license to flirt
Plus your friend said I was an asshole when he met me
No bad moods aloud when you're in the public eye
Walk through the muck with a clutch on a trident
Never give a fuck how far Pi went
You are dealing with a reborn icicle age poltergeist
Rock utter makeshift spirit
To y'all I'm just a funny moniker with a couple of fresh records
When the multi million
Tin men suck traditional rituals
Out the homes of starving children
And I bet they can see the city bleeding from the satellites
Formed by the corporate war drums recorded poorly
Bruised by the hues of wicked pallets
Chewed by the tooth of livid maggots
Mars attacks colorfulness
Hazy days will stay purple
Like Crazy Eddie commercials
Network with a dirt devil
Cute the way your little parasol spins.
Suck my Neanderthal dick.
Losing the screws and bolts
Suicidal eye full of plastic nine.
They only came to buff the name stuck the train
That's a textbook page
For my seed up in flames
Curators cater to killers of innovators
No batteries no jumper cables
Nurture the craft of concrete visionaries
Cave paintings get the natural history feather dust
Ranger Ricks endanger the clique maximum efficiency
Binder bibles and a graphite prison violator
With Joshua for the war gamer systems.
My elephant television was on.
They say his eyes were spiraling back when he hit the mat
Junkyard Dog. Hot tin roofs cradle kittens with them sub par flaws.
They only came to buff the name stuck the train
That's a textbook page
For my seed up in flames
Curators cater to killers of innovators
No batteries no jumper cables
They only came to buff the name stuck the train
That's a textbook page
For my seed up in flames
Curators cater to killers of innovators
No batteries no jumper cables
Don't get cooked by the pilot light
I can smell metal in the air tonight
I can smell metal in the air tonight
I can smell metal in the air tonight
Don't get cooked by the pilot light
I can smell metal in the air tonight
I can smell metal in the air tonight
I skunk the blood up as to numb the public interface
Prowler fist up with a Bowser twist vs. America's kooky coward clips.
Voodoo lullaby placebo collide zombies.
A billion little crimson pinholes sweat on vintage quill venom developed by a fatal blues anthology.
Communities on cue bury their ostrich beaks.
I got my tongue down Karma's throat. Half a dozen spy cams rigged up in blackmail science.
Swamp rats back off a destiny that fucks her clients hence the riots.
I flashed the grossest fang in show biz
Plus a new kink in the posture
Get high innocently kiss once when she's punch drunk
Watch her misinterpret the moment tongues touch
But Jenny in the sky with emerald eyes
I'm clinically bonkers and hate just about everyone God's great earth offers
And if I can't wear jeans and sneakers then I won't be lamping there
But Jenny could be Jeannie so easily if you'd let me
And I'm circling her like a tiger shark frenzied but friendly
The way you haven't made eye contact with me once in ten minutes
So there it is... game. I mean it's not like I'm sweating you
Watch out ladies cause you know he don't love ya
Bazooka Tooth is one bad motherfucker
He's a low life pimp with a low life game
He needs a no life dame with a strobe light frame
No ring on the finger
There ain't no strings attached
But if you love television and
Get a carton of cigarettes
And we can make it happen
Just leave your bag up on the curb with the trashcan
It ain't like I seen you in maxim
Relax with the tap dance
Before you knew the underground or independent existed
I watched the whole scene straight jump on the dick
Dirty dusty intelligent wit and word murdering
A hardcore poetic informed without burglary
Potent and shook the shit out of rappers who just learned of me
Arrogant unafraid shit developed riding a train thinking of brain fucks
Had everybody sprung wondering where I came from
With an indelible squad of design monsters
Selling a hundred thousand without a radio chart hit
Now someone else is taking a ride with what's mine
So I had to develop styles with a death device cooked in
So when I battled in basements I had eight sentences
Waiting way before the four you had laced in
So when I finally blew up I remained sick
Back when the independent scene remained faceless
We were the only crew who promised your ass we'd take it
That's why I always get respect from true soldiers
It's funny how the most nostalgic cats are the ones who were never part of it
Then humbly move the fuck on and come with that new retarded shit
My favorite ones are the ones who started that young rap about
And even though they were soft they had fun
But they couldn't break out the frame of the town they came from
I'm keeping their puppy styles in the Company Flow kennels
But since they had no identity from the start
They started to resent the scene when they couldn't become a part
I'll slap the shit out of you to continue my nerve racket
Patting themselves on the back for making that new outdated shit
And y'all trying to chase me
You don't innovate because you can't innovate
It's not a choice despite what you might tell your boys
Keep your identity crisis under the table
I always knew who I was and I'll always be more famous
For the best in the vendor biz
Hunters froze up and exposed Rapunzel weeds
The revolution will not be apologized for
And still know the time when you record flops
Now this is on a sick with it factor
Wanna burgle the buzz over definitive cash
After a life of labor camps starts paying innovators back
That engine sputters while the hound dogs wire cutter mechanical rabbit
Bantam weight puppies ain't rabid enough to snatch him
Pockmark ninety Moses approach with a golden focal point
Wrong name by a molar can often expose your phobias
Watch a cobra grow hands to hold his own tongue when he notices
Your own private apocalypse
Wide open with banged out cutlery from a slang mouth teacher
And money is an ugly god we all fall for
That means when I wake up and decide to comprise the new shit
It's not some watered down version of what my favorite crews did
This is how the city folk and mole people connect
Somebody warp the message right I'll pass it to the next
Now the perforated county's making you upset
Buried his nozzle in fossil marker art
Cadaver had a legitimate pulse
And littered volts are with the village
Where the skittish pigeons molt
Bastard poacher gasped
He rose to see salt in the open blisters but
Itching to pull it back
With that organic invention incubated to hatch
Some can try to make it fructose on paper now
Allow the details later and the crews will taper out
Bazooka tooths who keep the paper route
Cradled by twelve empty Zelda heart containers
But no hostages no promises
In and out of traffic jam and murder scenes
Some toddler's smuggled tommy guns and crack into the nurseries
Evolution for the young killer convenience
This is how the city folk and mole people connect
Now the perforated county's making you upset
This is how the hermit inc. and busy bee connect
Somebody's losing track of their flesh and blood in arrests
Misplace the bottle might catch a bad one
If the Jesus piece around your neck is bigger than your pistol
Just show the saints at heaven's gate you should be on the list
I hear overlooks manslaughter for a tattooed crucifix
Somewhere to laminate dry bones in cool water and ease medulla
After you thumb sucking diaper chains
Give birth and shoot the school up
Teenager beef past alligator teeth
Amongst tadpoles that have yellow backbones
Team mechanism brought airborne shrapnel scraps to hassle captain
Hiding clips that light the sky in seconds
Like dueling communal hopscotch gives them leverage
While I mumble in the immortal slang of Mush Mouth
I used to think I'd get hit by a bus or something dumb and dumber
Now the bus is slugs plugged by the newest kiddie thug wonder
Rep a wide pride dosage
For tomorrow the holsters are bound to outnumber the roaches
When global terrorism's all the rage your folk get smoked local
Before the war cheats me
Strains don't vacate slow
This is how the city folk and mole people connect
Now the perforated county's making you upset
This is how the hermit inc. and busy bee connect
Somebody's losing track of their flesh and blood in arrests
Misplace the bottle might catch a bad one
Got the phone call Jam Master Jay died
Because the stingers tend to cling more than a portable hay rides
It adds up when a pioneer fall
There's banana peels in your hamster wheels
Get up to get down now
I don't wanna do it anymore
I don't wanna do it anymore
Couldn't do it if I tried...
Lucy was in the sky with diamonds
Five dollars to hold them
Back to back like Mad Hatter magic
Splatter bachelor fabric fatter with Cabbage Patch lit
What's fouler was the other farmhands growing gills and shark fangs
What's fouler was my torso stripped to ribbons in the marshlands
Let's get this window pane and shut the fuck down
Down by the river where the litter sits
Twelve hour solid gold entertainment
Other shit to sell from other ships that sell they DD paper
This one's for the labor days worked for rent and rolling papers
Whistle while you work like a canary lung
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy to carry drugs
I sorta see it as my last flash summer
Skateboards and sloppy psychedelics and big numbers
All airbrushed on a collapsible easel
And I knew the gash wasn't gonna stop bleeding
And I knew how September would then affect it
Last sturdy domino leans secluded
Dragnet lifer solutions
Little soldiers developed like serpents despite life sentence ducking
Some don't like sobriety's dirty lenses
Some do let sleeping dogs lie still
Don't look so damn lackluster
Lost summer's display laminate showcasing divinity
Live system definitive
Yeah NASA let's try this
These bark mark targets where the barnacles nest
Walk off with a thumbs up and a stuffed Bullwinkle trinket
Whose handshake carry with it
He couldn't. You can't.
I'm more than two lambs with a Mongoloid loyalty clause
After chrome fangs I'll rewrite Heavy Metal Parking Lot
Smolder over composure models like
Smoke over soldier nostrils
There must have been something up in that Long Island tap water
What risk he added dodge blame game for sneaky plots
With elevated rung placement derived from deep rooted jealousy issues
They cued a raging bull and every due is paid in full
Not a catcher peddled backwards for a hacker's filthy looks
Hogwash Harry clamp norm
Herbert's pacemaker and vacate personal space in relation to face breaker
Probably when Ozzy's friends slept on the poppy stems
But it burns that cavalry of concerned worms for Mayor
Use hooky out the institute since huckleberry molds
Styled after the Hermann Rorschach margin mark
Trapped in the lap for garter belt
Cripple a kitten if a kitten is a culprit
Every leader dead and its making you upset.
Every hero dead and its making you forget.
I'm in and out a pig channel serrated by hand feeders.
Army of vicious kidney patrol yam peelers.
The only mammal officially banned from food chain
Triple six game never chose me.
Just a trooper with a question mark machine needy
No land lords or super.
Too many grown men calling in sick over cramps
I weigh in heavy on the jaded bitter subtracting the frontal gimmick
I want to solve world hunger and fuck a pinup
I want to find a 21st century carbon crutch worthy of pedestal placement and shitty path walking to touch.
Every leader dead and its making you upset.
Every hero dead and its making you forget.
Ain't no time to sit and lift stones
So its left to the dogs to find their way home
And you grew up in a similar generation alone
With fist full of humanoid models along the road
Fuck if I can find a flesh and bone tour guide to etch me through the makeshift
Every little footprints dated and ancient
For the first time in a long line of dog fights
Some cats grow by the laws of the wild
Some learn slower and lag in the mud
Some stand up in defense of a style
Some let the big dogs eat them up
Five Borough fame guaranteed to itch pigskin
Overqualified with the rent stick
Sick of pushing skewed information
And abusing the nation
Critical ways or waving a gun
Held a knife to the VP on TV
She demanded that the format be expanded
Billy was a coke fiend
Like a dope he stole green
Banking off his old scheme
She recognized his plot
He thought he was home free
She knew that he was locked
Now it's off to the jail in a blue squad car
She pocketed the crack before they got far
Billy watches Maggy from behind steel bars
They call him Larry Luck
Till he bet her ring finger
Seen him leaving Las Vegas
Less than what he came with
Itched to get rich found nickels in the couch
Hitched back to the casino with in an hour
And was immediately shot to his death over debts
Then the EMS survived
Said that he could be revived but they lied
Afterlife realized that water from the skies
Washes pain from our eyes so our hopes could rise
Bum touched girls looking young enough to thumb suck
Ted did 20 years for rolling some weed
Though he used to snort coke and dabble with speed
Some cats grow by the laws of the wild
Some learn slower and lag in the mud
Some stand up in defense of a style
Some let the big dogs eat them up
I got one Jack or Jill
I guess I sense two felt bumps in the tar
Parted your partners veil and dipped
Turns out I wasn't cast in the master plan anyway
Same one she used to hold in both smiles
But kill the rekindling dreams and navigate the friendship
We have high demands column to this pigeon ankle
Cater the alien decomposer soldier platter like cabbage check eight
Smolder as the Bazooka Tooth holster fabric
Buddy up and head down to the metal corporate tunnels
I'd be lying if I said I knew your intentions
See my sexy sabotage seeks defensive action to save the race
Red five revival there's wires in the bible
The sun rose over a body bag shortage
Hiding human hear me rise above material and cardinal sin
They shot me in the face
In the corner of the cave reinventing the wheel and roll out funny
Bad cholesterol through blood sugar
Swarm to the sickly thawed out the glacier
Who chase till we all catch vapors
Your head will be down in the dirt
We'll end it real quick
Your head down with a mouth full of pebbles
Flood a little soldier blood over the ogre acres
And my dog tags jingle by the monster island heart he built.
Be all you can be just never soothed us.
You lost me in that part about scrubbing piss with a toothbrush.
Holler scum's lullaby.
The black market mockingbirds can not sing a lick but lean to peck your eyes out
And magnify through the same lens that set the ants on fire.
Pocket all you can now.
Block will lead the lambs down to the cold cutlery outfit.
Motor prone to pen the holy opus and pry this monkey off the scoliosis.
It's like never mind the bullocks.
Like every other week these hipster tabloids jumping on and off my sex pistol's bullets.
Like every other week he spins the bottle.
Like every other week these fucking fanzines forget if they spit or swallow.
This is where the hunch back snake oil peddlers stuck under the burgundy sky of spaghetti westerns tend to bubble up.
Weathermen huddle up.
And too long have I followed yours.
The more the merrier.
Get a couple or more to carry you to the burial.
Fresh to death and keep it def to the left.
Delicate freak show alert the frame.
Bash all flags where the mag spin park.
Corroded by the volts that jolt the cold vein.
Boogie down kits to slip past the guard.
Def with a mascot of radical mass.
Megaphone fuzz and a woofer on fritz.
We are not trained to divert the crash.
But march face first with a prayer for the blitz.
Intimate eyes loop all known alleys.
Count it with the knuckle that hustle bread out a copper's tummy.
One of these rebels could level the marked city
Ultra. Soldier poach the folklore.
Jump guns through the 9th gate.
Jump guns like a noon 6 burner lit up on the 9th pace.
Never lured by the formal watching imported wines age.
These area a few of my favorite venomous side effects.
Spinal tap crabs to the clapper.
Aesop Rock is the Cadillac of natural disaster.
Everybody gotta push something.
That's why the envelope is where it wasn't.
A hundred million motherfuckers with they hands out
Verse a walking zipper bomb trying to keep the man down.
It's either fancy footwork or get bit by the hounds.
It's either fist to the sky or get bit by the crowd.
I was chewing my tongue out of my mouth one day
When the blood in my beard hit the dirt by the blazers.
Oblivious to the glimmer of innocent duck feathers.
I'll be at the Bronx Zoo with a lock pick kit.
Nazi cops on kamikaze belly flop shit.
Boom. Bounce when the church corrupt.
When the mayor knuckle dust city worker bugs.
When the stars finger babies like I flirt with sluts.
You'll see the fire engine red fox ears perk up.
Measuring mellow on the levitate off the mezzanine.
Cane for stress. Crack if the former left you unimpressed.
Like suspicious cargo in a high school locker.
A hundred million motherfuckers hold me back.
It's either fancy footwork or get bit by the hounds.
It's either fist to the sky or get bit by the crowd.
An earthly story with a heavenly meaning
Well they were selfish with the helmets on the little bus
Would one day rise in sections to interrogate the Holy Ghost
Call me crazy but I'd bet that wasn't God's demeanor
One church with a bait and tackle store next door and not much more
Christmas morning smelled fresher than angel pussy
But immaculate conception came second to playful goodies
Grandma was a saint while he'd paint with snakes and bullies
By the time I was old enough to know what religion was
I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused
He said that one day the king would say to these people
For when I was hungry you gave me food
I was sick and you visited me
And the king answered
Just a little bruised in the back of the pews
Acting amused with a mask on them Vatican blues
For in the eyes of the organization I was raised in
Cubicle adjacent to the killers and rapists
I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Just a lit fuse in the back of the pews
Watching a thousand flavors of the same God feud
I figure ultimate peace is the common theme
Got a basic good and evil sensibility born
Good neighbor know a halo wouldn't fit over horns
I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Dripping out the sticks like a twig tweed hammock
Miser tuck the big screen panic near the business card
Scrappy navigate the yellow corn height for the barn when the spot light swivel hard right over the farm
I have not received my papers
I have zero natural enemies
I don't know my location
Unfortunately courted by the most tenacious guardians whose aimless nature bait a harlequin to taste the martyr skin
You will die for the glory of...
Shit I can't put my finger on it but it's big
He approaches cobras with an ugly muck and bloody bowie knife clamped in the canines
What is your major malfunction
I have not received my papers
I have zero natural enemies
I don't know my location
I'm standing at attention
With a pocket full of weapons.
And the will to walk a mile
In the same fatigues that I slept in.
I have yet to find a day in life worthy of my saluting.
High scores keep automatons enthralled
And it's no longer whisper mode on the red alert
No bed of dirt sniper rifle peaking out the bunker
Now I'm center city looking for something to puncture
But adrenaline could lead to lazy eye hassles
So he missed the little boy and
Took the the pin out the pineapple
Bumps into the steel toe
Two limbs short of fixed.
Leak a baby pool around the standard issue weaponry
They will step over the body for the looting...
I have not received my papers
I have zero natural enemies
I don't know my location
I'm standing at attention
With a pocket full of weapons.
And the will to walk a mile
In the same fatigues that I slept in.
I have yet to find a day in life worthy of my saluting.
Here come the hard rock bump through the speaker top.
The tweeter meter blew code def hones in.
Jump into the chemicals sold in my zoning.
I'm a savage from a rabid ass country.
It's sorta tricky the way you wanna go get your digits.
Then you kick back once the inertia start.
The serpent's arch alerts every circled shark.
And when the first arm's found we observe the art.
Rather kick when the face already raped by the worms.
These little kids walking the ave. quick to produce a biscuit.
Now you should medicate any area that the pain hits.
And when you in the streets you should peep the sets of strangers.
The actors that are in fact a cast of chaos.
They be looking for any situation they can play on.
When you out of data they run through a route that'll save ya.
I design kill pain cave penmanship.
Federal analog hog unedited.
This city fit my style exactly.
You don't get used to the pain. A maniac bruising the cage.
And the whole world is yours now.
Before the steppers are goosed kick your door down.
Dressed to kill... self.
Megawatt with a horizontal neck spin swim funny to vertical bobble head yes men.
I'm a freak in the flesh that penetrates lust.
The core's no picnic.
Mislead whores advancing.
Diseases in the minute the idiot got home.
I want to grade the papers but I don't want to give them A's.
With an Uzi filled with rulers.
This city fit my style exactly.
Suit the hell hounds with blades and chain lengths
For the dead walk a little less clumsy than you think.
Let's bet it melts together.
Let's get these men some shelter
It's a bath house for brave soldiers
When they coordinate to fornicating whores in maid's clothing.
Never returned to brag about that fish bigger than you and me.
The curmudgeon's gun dusty like the road to death.
Just a guilty gizzard wanna recommend a pill slip.
Now holds a bachelors in training ninjas to tip toe better.
These are them sham city kidney kicks to the loose bolts
In the land of hot milk and honey with stingers in it. ZINGER.
Brain soaked the opiates.
Appropriately procreate.
When they aren't telling stories
They are multiplying grossly on the lawn.
Interesting in a sense...
How quickly they will lift their heads...
And breathe an ultimatum like the dead don't argue.
Like they had done their little part in cleaning up the public...
With a steaming plate of justice for them East Baker stomachs.
We the legends at home with the unremembered.
To double as a vessel to drag its legacy under it.
The too alive channel from the library of rivalry.
Gonna dance around the table like they own the place.
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Not enough young in his lung for the water wing
Colorfully vulgar poacher at a mulch like
Sign of the time we elapsed
When a primate climb up the spine and attach
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
Where the cash cows actually beef
Blood turns wine when I leak for police
And I will remember your name and face
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
Now if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
And express no regrets though he isn't worth the homeowners piss
Sign of the swine and the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure and a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more
Sat where the old cardboard city folks
Swap tails with heads like every other penny throw
And I will remember your name and face
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
You can be my little Snake River Canyon today
And I ran with a chain of commands
Sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
What a bit of gusto he muster up
And it's a beautiful thing
To my people who keep an impressive wing span
Even when the cubicle shrink
You gotta pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
NY chew through the machine
And I will remember your name and face
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
Fit into the aforementioned or slipped through the pinholes
Both the formal squad censor
But things will still go bump when them halogens pop
I'll be there when it happens
The lady of the lake off the answers
Admitting the mistakes to their deplaning cadavers
I wrote your name in wet cement by the corporate banks.
Catacomb kids cuddle up fantastic labor
When the towns be freak sleep
He will ask for papers
He will catch the vapors
Beautifully echoed in the pace at which he shoveled his meals
Like not a farmer among us had a harvest survive the winter
One shoe in the soupy gutter
I'm dumber than a cow on a roof in a flood
Who's not as dumb as the tat wit the same scenery
Sparky nails pig stigmata for all good sport
Garbage pail kids unite at the mall food court
They had shut the school down early
There were bombs inside the lockers
No concept of the problem
We responded like a snow day
It was clobber shit to flotsam
Till the cops said it was okay
Show the squadrons back into their boxes like his Breakfast Club of hotheads show no progress to the doctors
It was rain of the razor laser
Day of the cloudy howdy
Flight of the shelter melter
You can bow without me
Solar boy elope with couch choking on older Polaroids
Motormouth show for the golden molar toy
Idol. Once soldering a perfect union
It is vital to calculate any ornery loose ends.
Who later learn it may actually be safer to play with knives
I show up late looking project grizzly
He'll be numb enough to chill before the choppers spill the blood
Jet setting on spec with a dead
Yeti on the roof rack.
And miscreants will rubberneck jalopy euthanasia
Which will later be regretted when it's your turn for cremation.
Freak a little witch hunt.
Gathering the carnies and exploiting every stigma.
The malformed oddities amongst sovereignty's normal
Shall abuse every vice you can imagine right before you.
With a nose for commotion and stolen goods...
We were busy putting barbs on a large iron gate.
They're gonna want his milk money next.
Stare into the glowing eye of Cerberus and crow
Authoritative laminates will not repel the quarantined alone.
All the town simply know the Coke machine is home
And you can hear the iron maiden's lock
Or see the town crier's ankle stock chained up to the tanker truck.
A. I walk as the hype of the city gossip
This is little Russian dolls that get smaller and smaller still.
This a corpse full of pills trying to sit still and build
Cause eight planets bullied Number Nine until he fell.
Tear up the metal hat and seasons
In the baggy stomach lining attached to the bums in hiding
Sits the morals every outing he slides to refine his grinding.
You will live inside the actual second they let the hounds loose.
With a nose for commotion and stolen goods...
We were busy putting barbs on a large iron gate.
You should package it with a last smoke and six feet of rope
And in the same direction
But he was just a stupid simian that let her live with him
And in the same direction
Pirouetting madly on a mirror full of baggies
Stay awake little misfit
Her lips wet a very particular mischief
Or settle for a warm burgundy bubble out of her beak instead
And in the same direction
The house of card carpenters who never
A paddle at mental patients. raping the
Competition to smother the pain and sin
So he pounds you out in table tennis like
Demented interactions sleep and thoughts
Documented. he's lingering insane paint
Thinner in his vein colors blown out around
He crafted a path to escape his condition.
Would cling to the white walls the psych
Halls in his mind soon bled the words he
Before more injections strapped to the bed
Rap in his head. when his wrists released
Day of release said depart from me I never
Hunters with their dogs and deer rifles
Thousands of them line the pavement
Like patient pupae waiting to become worms
Like I walk in front of 39 thieves in a beat
Blew into the bugles in lieu of the euthanasia
Usually the shooter community chew the corpse
But I see the wolves have already gotten to you and yours
Train a barrel of monkeys to aim at the lowest bogey
Stole the golden fleece with the culture of total nobodies
Two cities and the one is broken up in tiny towns
For a photographic token of my primordial growth
Hell's bells every which way the the wind blows
Never let an anchor drop
Never talk to strangers
This is the life and the life will not end.
Money Money Money Money
Money Money Money Money
39 Thieves are quicker than 40 winks
39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks
We're not concerned with the community aloofness
Money is cool and I'm only human
But they use it as a tool to make the WORKERS feel excluded
Like the shinier the jewel the more exclusive the troop is
Another dark night...
Weapons to the heavens and arsenic where the carrots grows
Piss warmed sugar water wore the summer canteen
Both say the feudal group
The parking lot was never yours
Black top pebble wars
Soldiers mold it where the Jones is every grown up
Want the code again to get to grow in
Hog barn burner come see if your homes hold us
Let us in the jetty when they jettison the medicine
And paranormal hatchet and cadets to break the levees in
Both know the totem camaraderie
And sleep the sleep of the just
Where the witchcraft spun out of a neighboring sect
With the usual undesirables and the big brother cutters
Never let an anchor drop
Never talk to strangers
Dead men tell no tales
In a powder blue tux from the farmer's sale
Mr. Big Sleep with the carp and kale
Like walk the plank for whom the shark thank
He was suffocating slow in the box of a buccaneer.
He'll be the laughingstock of the Barbary Coast War like
So he raped and he pillaged and he feud and he brawl.
So by the time they bumped into the island he could barely lift his grog.
And nary a high tide so grand as the one
Pretend like her gills didn't dry up and suffer
Dead men tell no tales
In a powder blue tux from the farmer's sale
Mr. Big Sleep with the carp and kale.
Apache on the ship shape and Bristol fashion
Gun for the whole family
Before shooting troops was cooler than hula hoops
High noon was your basic who's who of brutal truth.
And tricky was a wooden horse pushed up on your porch.
Where the ants leave nothing but the bones and the car keys.
Big city translate your face till it atrophy...
Like it's the last of the seconds
Before the worst of disasters stretch past us.
Up into the section that's reserved for the smirk of the coldest witnesses.
Work you motherfuckers
Sixty thousand watts of that raw
Look at how they bathe up in that dove blood.
It's gonna be a night of thrills and chills where the sacred is made of
And I was overly engrossed from a very locked door
With a couple milk duds
Monkey in the middle study how
The origin of a thievery leader will take place
Two coke bottles adorn the rogue toddler
And no role model provoke him to shift focus
Kids got the darnedest quirks
And bought enough fireworks from the bullies to blow up a small barn
Which he kept in a box in the yard
Celebrate the natural need to own what ain't earned
See it rolls off the tongue
Later apply the motives to a moment on some grown shit
On the prickly catwalk of the modern grind slide rule
Every last number in its history
Got its own little hustle to nuzzle up with the victory
Bathe in a bottle of your finest
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you...
One by one like little confused penguins
Like a bitter little burglar jaded up out the bucket seat
Is dumb enough to feel like the public owe him a fucking thing
If an eye's on the prize and the itch ain't flushed
Step on the abysmal cusp
With matchmakers trying to make the mixed signals fuck
Then incubate the mutt baby through his stigma's crutch
Like he will learn to walk after he lifts the drums
And a crummy motherfucker breed fuck with me
I hope the flipping of the system will be heavily clocked
Welcome to the magic in a basket of cash.
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you...
Six billion gorillas for whom the graves yawn
Dueling blades that cue the cruel charade and fuel the flames
If you would clue the crew into the civil
Sat beneath an avalanche and jagged inadequacies
Cops and robbers riot by the vows of noxious sirens
Take it his friends and neighbors didn't cater
Sunday mornings reinforced the waiting gates of Hades
And he brazen but apparently inferno bound now
For when a man of cloth recite his wrongs he wouldn't bow down
The punishment should fit the reasons you must punish him
Never puncture skin or pull the colored rugs from under them
Two opposing mother ships shall not employ the gunner's deck
Cause brotherhoods of public good do not employ the unctuous in you
All the stoic odium glowing a coal holster
I'd known it wasn't roses but hoped it was less corrosive
Coast in to the focus of the grossest diagnosis like
Have clued into suitor as capital to a beggars hand
With carnivores that burrow like hunters into the blood and meat
The Jenny chin up and the city picked her sinning pen up let her numb the spitting stigma
Along came a spider sold her eggs to any buyer
Now the shooter in back is six legs wider than the driver
If you make no friends on the way to the top rung
There is no secret handshake club I do not give a fuck
But know the cancers make the olive branches obviously standard
So when they extend from the yachts and mansions drop your cannons
Will he clip to zip line or slip for his final dip dive
They pump into the pinstripe pentagrams over tinsel town
Or kill a man who trickled down the city with his scissors out as sickles
Dipped in military hells bells and whistles
Thank you for the peace on earth and mercy mild high
So many dark arts to choose
You can focus till the phobias evolve in forty hues
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Tune into the prudence of the dark heart news
Breathing's a tug of war
Wet when I rushed aboard
Plus twenty nine bust gum stuck cluster door
Slumped in the back Burn bush by the son of George
A system of gods from each of the brawling tribes
So my bible is a pot of cons clipped and collaged
Pavlov's bad dogs parry mass bells
Signals that flash and beat
Attack medic stretcher call cracked crazy header fall
He will locate every exit in seconds to flee the wormhole
On the very same day in the very same cold
Each sent a man with a torch to the borderline to boast
Watch them collide and explode
I ignore the private calls
What plague make an idling brigade
So eager to walk plans
They will climb a tree and wait
Irony is waiting over piety and faith
So when the ghostly ruminations that are kindly disobeyed
I'm gonna live to be a thousand with the patience of a saint
I could buy a million locks and finally read a book in peace
No more would my president come off as a crooked thief
And turn my heart so dark that it would bark when he looked for me
Sideways eye on a sinister boundary
99 models of fear on the wall timorous
Face in the mud where the moxie melt
More in a cave with a torch on the wall
Than a window arrangement of porcelain dolls
One little martyr who talk in his face
Make one little weathermen sharpen the blades.
Face in the bars of a regular cell
Boom town kid who was taught by the binge
In the case the afraid observe
Call for the monster beats and blockhead got
I crawled down to the basement
There's an envelope with some cash in it
Locusts stole the groceries out the local Farmer's Market
All God's critters hold positions
Each alive is an equal and vital piston I support
So when the piranhas honor New York
My daddy long legs dangled and mangled for sport
And place a cloven hoof on the lucrative when convenient
If Noah had the benefit of hindsight on his ship
He could've snatched two unicorns and left behind the motherfucking...
When all the wolves in woolly wigs
The skulls of Brooklyn's cruelest pigs
Will rain on Fulton's newest kicks
As mulish swine of all surrounding counties sniff the gruesomeness
We pass around the pineapples and pull the pins in unison
I will gladly feed you to the breed who wants you sacrificed
Hopefully the crack in his armor spreads to his avarice
War pig or pussy cat...
And while I don't really know the working details of your tribes
I know that that's one ugly fucking tie... asshole
Party like the butcher boy's cleaver is alive
I mosey into sixteen hours of smoke in the misty winter
Then dance until the sun has kissed your blisters in the morning
Push the mortar pestle past the ordinary orchard
Directly to the worms who shovel shit and yellow snow
This little piggy went to the market with a target
Postcards from the pink bath paint leisure
Cherry wooden nickels on his specs for the ferrymen
Pet cemetery in electric fresco
It's more a dormant cell of valor as awoken by the smell of sordid power
And defecting shortly after
Blue in the menacing grip of a day for which you're manifestly unfit
Led a purple tongue and ratty caballeros
Up over the black rainbow into the house of mirrors
Intimately spaced pylons on a plot of inhospitable terrain
A ruby tide insubordinate to lunar phases
That maneuver past the beaches to the bosom of the pavement
Now the bow drill smolder in a flooded bit of basement
Grace of misled teen who prefers his scenes with a little Wilhelm scream
One you can mow down slow as you grow up
Paint teeth on my lips
Free to occupy the same space in differing degrees of seedy commerce
Depending on the beacon that your voyeurs choose
And kidnap rapid eyes in their infancy
Everything his cutting room scrapped
All these tribes hoard breads and wines
These climates transform men to swine
All these hives hide knives and lead
These bribes can't transform swine to men
Sensible sweater on ice
Like shovels above a butter lamb with peppercorn eyes
That's idle handwork in the spirit of death dealers
Look at mommy's little Hercules
Flourish in the blind spot of spittle county gore police
Or really any readily ebbing and flowing war and peace
1 plain brown key foods bag head
The currency of brotherhood back in his cut palm
All these tribes hoard breads and wines
These climates transform men to swine
All these hives hide knives and lead
These bribes can't transform swine to men
Today a thousand sea lions got up and left a pier
They had successfully invaded and secured for 20 years
Some said it was the food supply or shifting weather patterns
Truthfully a whole community of scientists are in maybe 10 showed up at the wharf
Each a lumbering and boisterous glutton
A bottom dollar turns a nuisance to the pride of your cove
Which bring us back up to this morning when the colony dove
I got a couple unsubstantiated thoughts of my own they go
Maybe it'd feel more majestic and less fatty
If a 12 year old wasn't beaning it with salt water taffy
All these tribes hoard breads and wines
These climates transform men to swine
All these hives hide knives and lead
Four corners of paranormal
In a warehouse air where his dairy curdles
Circle the source of his power
Foresight born at the corner of Howard on sale
One eye on the bread crumbs
Other other eye on the income
Shoot dice with the lice and the ring worms
Take five take a dive in the cellophane
Turn five into five six seven eight
From the crypt in the end
If ya give an address and a rib or a piss
Don't question the mystery fish
Just picture shrimp on a pillow of grits
I fly these kites into the fray
I fly these kites into the cut
Try soft feel sourdough and heroin
Hold court with the cats and dogs
Who hold cools like an orb in a dragon's claw
And terry cloth robes outside detox surly
And not no Xerxes fear no moon man
Stay true like a wolf wearing wolf pants
For long enough to contain or employ his help
And now we look both ways at the asteroid belt
From a fortune of fisher king
And from assistant care blisters in his hair
New day new diary of disrepair
Soups on two tongue crucifix to bear
No shoes no shirt no fiscal year
Only took one tooth to crack the bug juice to chug
Outside home is an open swim
Occultism in the throes of corrosive wind
A cold meal with the ghost of friends
I stepped over a body in the door
I'm ships in the night
Portraiture in a human form
Moving his arm in a fusion of man made tools
And a muse from beyond
Even if it went beautifully wrong
It was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong
Oozed in a brand new cuneiform
Barely commune with the horde
Might zone out to the yap of the magpie
Unseen hand dragging his graphite
Cross contour little bit of back light
Black ink after a Bristol to baptize
You can imagine a rush that ensue
When you get three dimensions stuffed into two
Then its off to a school where it's all that he do
Being trained and observed by a capable few
Back in New York five peeps and a dog
In a two bedroom doing menial jobs
Plus rhyming and stealing and being a clod
Distractions free to maraud
I left some years a deer in the light
I left some will to spirit away
I let my fears materialize
I let my skills deteriorate
Haunted by the thought of what I should have been continuing
A mission that was rooted in a twenty year affinity and rickety condition with an
Nap on the front lawn look up in the sky its.
Shapes falling out of the fringe
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Colors pouring out of the fringe
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Natural light on a human face
Stenciled fire on his roommates bass
It was blooming addiction
A miss and a push and a pigment
Pin head kids Intermittent
And I grew up in a linseed oil over linen
Joy to the poison voice in the resin
Capture a map of the gesture
Back up add a little accurate fat to the figure
Re do that move that inwards
Zinc white lightning shoots from his fingers
Studios drone with allusions of tinctures
Stay tuned for the spooky adventures
You can imagine the stars that align
When a forearm starts foreshortening right
Or a torso hung on a warping spine
Of proportion reads as warm and alive
Routine day with a dirt cheap brush
Then a week goes by and it goes untouched
Then two then three then a month
Then the rest of your life you beat yourself up
I left some seasons eager to fall
I left some work to bury alive
I let my means of being dissolve
I let my person curl up and die
Eating up his innards an unfeasible anxiety is brutally committed to relinquishing
His privacy aligning with the trials of the anti Midas
Nap on the back lawn look up at the sky its...
Shapes falling out of the fringe
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Colors pouring out of the fringe
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Got a tattoo of a lipstick print attached above his collar
I watch him relocating pistachio to a waffle
Thinking I had lost the plot if not the passion for the novel
He asked me what I wanted. I ordered something daft
He said he liked the tattoo Alex drew me of the bats. Thanks
I like it too but modestly confess in present company my coloring is not the main event
Look at that neck. The message is immediate the guy F's chicks
I spent a lot of years making friends with cool artists
So when they drew me tattoos I could truly feel important
It's a 22 year old inside a cube of brick and mortar
Got me questioning my morals in a corny pecking order
I should give a shit less
The girl that worked down at the local juice place
Got a head full of dread locks down to her waist
I watch her add the spinach to the ginger to the grapes
She asked how many years it took the girl to grow the crop
My mind's fucking blown
I used a folding map to find the juice place in the first
These kids are running wild I'm still recovering from church
You should have seen me in the eighties I was bumping New Edition dragging acne into Hades
I used to floss the albatross like Daddy Kane with the chain
Steep in a self imposed Stockholm and Lima in flux
Maybe an occupation popular with demons and ducks
Made any mingling akin to being seasoned and stuffed
Each one separately convinced
Delusion turned the communication to prison camp
There ain't a lesson we can learn from the ostensibly lost
I think it's funny when defendants from identical haunts
A measure of what the spectrum involves
I used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene
It meant a lot to feel the fugitive community breathe
Maybe to sentimentalize is to be truly naive
I know some shit about your heroes that you wouldn't believe
I think we're all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong
The songs are echolocation up in impregnable fog
That's why it's odd to see a pile of imperfections and flaws
Ascend a pedestal to patronize the rest of the cogs
God almighty chop an ivory tower to piano keys
You can't be cooler than the corner
Where you source all your parts
Insecurities exploding in emotional code
With braggadocio to go from mostly jokey to gross
You would wobble round your momma like an infant gazelle
The disillusionment has truly been a difficult pill
But you as anything menacing is a difficult sell
It's not even compelling melodrama
This ain't the medium for divas out to weasel and breed
I'm often coffee with the paupers over tea with the queen
Don't make him show the regency what disobedient means
In a pageant rivaled only by the origin of fire
Now add an organism from alternative environs
A dozen pair of cartoon eyes in a thicket
To see a neophyte get sliced into ribbons
Some here to pick lice off each other and assimilate
Duck a suit troubleshoot his moody user interface
Float his only vanishing point away from the picture plane
Go to where the radio trails off
And people catch rabies on the way to their mailbox
Still pull a broadsword from a hoarded synthesizer
Nap in a hole in a tree
Cat leaving voles at my feet
Jettison the rest and roulette us a new trajectory
Sidewalks end with ponds and frog eggs
Led light fueled ants to a hot lens
Ice over bittersweet nightshade
Antlers rise from his migraine
Till the roof is painted Gemini to set him free
Eat his own body weight in genocide
Who came back a decorated dog of war
Who wants more though he currently stuck in the dog door
Peer into the eye of a primordial experience
Portamento warriors and unforgiving wilderness
Found acquaintances a pain to babysit
Now pets hit the ceiling when the wind blows
Fish float belly up song birds crash in the windows
Swizzle apple cider vinegar and dish soap
Still shuffle through a stack of old photos
I don't know it feels weird
I'd rather feed an apple to a deer
Could've been the rebel yell
Or something more involved
Pounding on the front door and standing on the lawn like
None defied a one man walled city
Stone made flesh veins etched in his hands
Mutineer footage for your blooper reel who could tell
Pours hot tar from the top of the barn
Dog star in a jar bordering unsustainable
Always been a private dude who couldn't keep a tally
Of which lies he told who
Soon enough I will estrange you all
Bathrobe hammer toes murdering the curb appeal
What I be returning are forsaken with the craving and
I don't know I gotta think about it
Truthfully I don't know which makes me a bigger coward
Just know when the room go cold
Meet him at the crossroads drawn and quartered
It's a marvel of privacy over back honor
Raspberry jelly on his Jesus toast
And turn heather gray sweats into Easter clothes
With no immediately measurable crime wave ice age
Christ's children still skin a cat sideways
I don't pick teams or administer bands
I'm in a creek with a pick in a panic go
Forcibly ejected or a voluntary death scene
Steps up to the plate
Rookie season for the skinny slugger
Pit against a pitcher with a ripper you could eat off
When I caught him staring down at something moving through the grass
Not before he could identify the culprit
No baseball in the bubble
Parents thought it adorable
The players followed suit
Inning crawling to a close
Head coach not amused
Coach on the diamond dragging 27 inches of aluminum behind him
The following is a transcript of man vs vermin
Man stands out by a hole
Pest pops up to patrol
In a scene that would try every child as adults
Pallbearer with a ball mitt
Thrown over the fence
My little brother is a funny dude
A lot of funny shit happened to him
My other brother pretty funny too
Ain't seen him in a minute though
Not a part of the machine
And a record player vomiting Alien Sex Fiend
Peel sessions in a Christian home for field testing
It's real youth in the palm of your hand
When your mom thinks Satan is involved in a band
We were buried in the Village Voice
Checking who was playing where
It was Christ has risen to Chris
Coming to a theater he would be there in the flesh
Countdown to ultimate concert experience
Maybe she could properly investigate
What occurred next were the top of the lungs of a son who unjustly had lost what he loved
In a moment that would transcend anger to high art
My older brother is a funny dude
A lot of funny shit happened to him
We hadn't spoken in a couple moons
I called him last night
Been a bit since Mu died
Been a lot more lost than awake
I recall thinking someday someone's gonna say it's all from the same cause and effect
And I just couldn't fathom
Each claim individual peaks and pockets
Pains in a slew of unique nuances
When you wake up eight years non responsive
It's a lot to process
Gone from a happier jack in a box
Once upon a time he was so much more than a punchline for his own potshots
Everything that he touch turns promptly to shit
If I zoom on out I can finally admit
It's all been a blur since Mu got sick
None of the subsequent years stood a chance
Whether he was mom's or his man's
Whether he was pop's or his girl that was poison
Heart full of canines
Whole life trying to quiet them down
Like a suicide king with a knife in his crown
True friendship in a tugboat way
Into the woods go his alien tongue
It was that or a textbook faking a funk
8 years been one long blindside
Knowing ain't half the battle
That's a bullshit quip written by some asshole
You can own what you are
And still sit around stoned in your car
Cranky and waiting for a boss key and hat full of bills
My first name is a random set of numbers and letters and other alphanumerics that changes hourly forever
Charlatan psychiatry and troubleshooting undertow
Nervous in the service still
I'm burger meat and purple pills here
You pack up all your manias
Sitting in the waiting room
I'm half a human combing over Home and Garden stoned
A thousand shitty paintings wrap around a wounded animal
I'm climbing up the stucco
That pretty penny turn the prickly into Benji
I finally crunch the budget up and punch the button
She called my name out and pushed me into an oven
You built your walls up high or say goodbye to all your Cookie Puss
Vaccine queen deem church socks hostage
Look in her eye like she might be a wizard
And probably hoarding forty more in the corners of Fort Knox
Swapped twenty on the spot and copped the warlock
Briefs on her head playing Walking With a Panther
Good around misery and golden era samplers
Jeopardy and Wheel at the heels of her handlers
Here to bat around keys and the means to euphoria
Under a thought bubble rich with bowls of goldfish
Skittish in the company of stranger danger
In a steel cage match with a maze of cables
Spun plum dizzy in a frisky moment
Decorate her cubicle with dogs playing poker
Fifteen years taking prescriptions
The death knell generator entertain a fresh kill
Breath quell dressed like a bloated sack of dead cells
A single flower through the permafrost
Pick himself and learn to walk in furry pants
Who still shop surplus and can't hold jobs
Might pedal by the police
Ah fuck that shit look
Can't tell if I'm a little withdrawn
Or dead dogs set to quote unquote live on a farm
My wig picker threw me out of her office
Got brats on the grill
Wormwood in a cauldron
Horse hoof in the dog's mouth
Make money periodically vomiting on himself
I read Nat Geo craft and crack geodes
Lift party hats out of Craft Depot
Unleaded mire blood pumped through his neck
Came down from the mountain
Before player ever met his omega
They were effectively reducing his behavior into data
With plans to build a dais where the
People grow potatoes and cabbage
In a spectacle display in the nature of strange neighbors
I paint caves till the rage campaign tapers
Show a new crop how he used to moonwalk
Out of breath like a seven day old balloon dog
I still hang band posters and buy black lights
Crib decorated like a dorm room at Brandeis
Then convince me to pay him for his teas and tinctures
Fore I'm gone like Gossamer under number three clippers
Three forged in various pulp channels
Even his prized horse rides a wolf into battle
Even his blood and body couldn't pick him out a line up
Or his name off the paper
Buying nickels for a dime at the park
I learned to rhyme in New York
I learned to breathe underwater
I learned to walk with a ghost
Adidas reeking of sulfur
A children's cemetery font
When home is a bleeding ulcer
Everything you've ever stood up for is keeling over
Cartoon death catfish on a farm
And tough with two F's
My spirit animal comes with a pretzel bun
Troll of the treadmill
Edgy from elevenses to megabucks
This is how we level up
As ushered out of two fingers pecking at the keys
Went from healthy to unhealthy to a hell he never leaves
Back in the back of the classroom
After a magical nap in a vacuum
Whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you
Whistle while you're waiting for your condition to stabilize
Unabashed privacy expanding into simulcast
Some people have mistaken my allegiance for a weakness
The type that fake his death then forget he faked his death
Whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you
Sometimes I feel my heart putrefying inside my body
On my better days and then mingle and walk off into the poppy
Had to buy some clothes that fit me
And pretend I like agave
With a promise to his congress not to compromise the motley in him
Maybe I should kinda sorta move to Mars
The piss poor vision is forty percent floaters
The kitchen is a chorus of glorious leftovers
The friends you confessed all the dark shit to
And they want a little pearl in how he got to where we at
Walk on even when the walls hug his coat
Whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you
That chewed his plumage to the root
And proved a prequel to malaise
A feud he knew was brewing blew up in his face
He'd been replaying the scenario for days
With the variables replaced
Wolves are in the sky with more diamonds than the carpet from the Shining
We jarred a lot of lightning up
Shook a turkey leg or ten
Maybe we deserve a day of rest
One AM defend the whole block
I could drive into a lake of fire
It's probably more the kid than the kid
Either way a vital widget in the system is sick
All I could do was plug the roof with my gum
One AM defend the whole block
Soon the safety propaganda clamps breeds on leashes
Make a lot of noise when you frolic under the ether
Keep a hand on the pepper spray
Sneakers on the detour
Guilty innuendo romanticizing the potter's field
You meet a few exceedingly forsaken
Sit around the cooler refusing domestication
A couple decades pass and you can't even find the wavelength you was on when you was running one AM
Seen a bear put a thousand chickens in a pot with carrots
Found nothing but the feathers and the skull
On the porch like a present with a bow
Dinner's in a black earth gutted and uncoupled from the patchwork
Buried by a seven year cherub in the backyard
Life in the vitamins invited up to cypresses
A testament to moxie in the miracle of lifelessness
It's tricky when you'd rather rot into the soil as a nutrient
The nuances of putrefying jelly
And I pick a ginger gold that's fed by a drunken uncle
Remember them ascending settling any high scores
Forty meters up with the heart of a high dive horse
Cause ain't nobody talking to you
Ripped the phone up out the wall
An embarrassing ordeal involving hospitals and questions
While explaining why you're selfish
To romanticize our rules
And watch unruly roots
Don't misconstrue the purpose
Any urge isn't discernible from
Community service to the kiddo
Plus you'd make a beautiful widow
But that's an altruistic ticket to a room with no windows
When they pulled him out of class over concerns about his safety
More he doesn't judge a man by how honorable his death is
On a scale you made up anyway
Half passed out to pasture
Whether clapped your batteries in backwards
Don't be trying to come all for me
An older me would note that whether disposable goldfish
Meek until the spirit isn't willing
While the flesh is still a staple of the labor forcing whistling
It's roadkill evoking emotion his own totem don't
That's a reality you evade or grow to own
A civil war becoming of ungovernable atoms
I'm born from the guts of stars and black tar pits
Crawls out a clawed coffin a huff and puff
Somewhere in between the dust and dust
And whatever stopped the voices
Colossal paranoia's out to author an abrasive law
Wrung stones unsung and alone
Approach a pen like revolution's just a sentence away
Till then he's documenting cops and watching heaven decay
It's not a gentleman's game it's a generation raised accordingly
You'll know the differences between the cozy and the quarantine
Yes y'all the crest fallen care warn
Scavengers already obsessively knocking on his molecules
Not a dollar watching Rocky II in Donatello boxers
More akin of angry mobs with anchor tats and mangy dogs in vacant lots
Traded any semblance of consistency to play the odds
Not even a baby doll to change his gauze
A side effect of sliding environment to environment
Departures and arrivals aren't only time in mileage
Try again again a raider break off from the phalanx
And never look back never cook crack K thanks bye
New York in the rear view then peel...
This was never an effective way to rally insurgents
Or really even the occupation of a rational person
When you write about seclusion and some buyers finally tune in
You get frightened finding happiness can drive away the movement
That fruition's for the viewers who need a loser to pity
Plus an underlying message of a greater disconnection
God forbid he try to live or gain momentum
Mend or pay his penance
You'd rather see him eat a bowl of mouse traps
Surf a thousand couches
Take a jagged little down the hatch
I know you love the way the failure flounder
Maybe I could be your daily downer
If his brain left his body and was headed for the door
Read a hostel gospel attributed to land shark Apostle squad
In a most stagnate tension basket
But fresh as the active element.
Spring water ain't enough any more
Well aren't we the phoenix of irritant method
Here to steer the flock out the farmland while every shepherd rested
I be the head shaker in a sea of nodding novelty dolls
Flush the pipe dreamer
Touch the skull of each and everything
Everything everything
Bullied by the bullies
One element to many to made a hungry man moan
Follow your hunch and align the hunt collection
To count their blessings in abundance.
Once in a crescent moon I'll adapt
Heads gather from every battered aspect of the march
Who born in what city and
And it gets tiring wiring the populace an anti grin and list of accomplishments
I'm from a room flooded with punishment
I've seen drunken sailors pilot they vessels to split the light house
Laugh at brown bag liquor list on there way home from the blood bath
See I wait a lifetime just to pierce these spears though the bellies of every monster.
Catapult the stone that struck the leader in the back and
Marked the beauty as the other 9 warriors worlds collapsed.
One element to many to made a hungry man moan
Notice I said I'd be on my way out the door
I mean the doors almost closed
Metropolitan grab bag apocalypse
Maggot patch is swallowing the traps baddest columnist
Held together by a beach bucket of bolts
I'm here to bleach masker lust and touch false allegations
Silence and the needle pin hybrid
Bought you this reflecting pool to school you on my underlying bias
I polish of the poison with a sip
I know my orphanage massive will help you lift my casket
Bury me beneath the cherry tree bough and run for the castle
Too geek to stop and decipher
Something I've seen with
The second in turn circled to confirm the fertilizer
And I'm one of a small tribe camped in a rubber stamp facility
With best friends like utility who needs these instabilities of mind
You wanna hold that grudge that's fine
In fact let's both hold grudges just to see who's stubborn and who budges
Well I'm the stubbornest bastard this side of 4 dimensions
And I'm here to build this picket fence around your frigid lenses
I'm saying don't get defensive
And you barely know yourself
But I don't claim to know yourself
And I hear you recognize the jeopardy
Honoring the touch of pure peasantry I've been harboring presently
Stolen promise lacking witness to the burglary
You see my version of ruler don't include underlings scumming through yellow pages for a future
Today I strike a match adapt tragedy
Tomorrow humankind's logic pistons crash and burn
The next day procreation becomes annual formality
I pack my bags and steadily trudged out the door
Off to secure my legacy in threatened water blizzards
I couldn't feed the masses with four fishes
I've been the engine all the way down to the railroad spike
Take this lesson as a key to that life mystery
It goes run walk crawl
But that cityscape makes me numb
Still managed to end up thirsty the day the nursery collapsed
In my hand I hold the plumage of a buzzard
I may have just saved your children
So I let my frigid demeanor teeter and take his vacant place
We three sprout from the same litter
Yet amazingly crafted by separate scissors
Half my time is herded toward little lost causes
I'm here to draw a fork in the road and call it the diary of common sheep aspiring
Little Billy star lit up the block got the right premise
Can't judge a man's dignity by the wattage in his stare
Pack up my belongings then it's off into the evening
Now I haven't exactly been embraced by the populace
Set sail upon the seven deadly seas of the anonymous
Pack up my belongings then it's off into the evening
My time to find a mile before the valley meets the hill
Where expectant slave smiles at the stick in the painted living
I'd place the button in the city square for everyone to push
You see my mission's responsibilities range across the board
And so I'd rather be a pen than a sword
Basic locomotive with a whistle and caboose
Packed up my belongings then it's off into the evening
I've knocked upon every little door that comes about
I'll sweep ya porch if you can spare a couple of breadcrumbs and a couch.
Pack up my belongings then it's off into the evening
This turning in my sleep is getting old and older still
This be the dawning of the age of dead water
Somebody live enough to bust through the belly with a fist up
This is a right now generation murdered by the fan base
With a still force activated
Formed by the village of badness and bad karma
But by the window's still three nickels in a piggy bank
Caught her with her head up funny stomach from the hunger pains
In a matchbox apartment adjacent a crooked starship
Doomed better nation the million's the only remedy
Nine dizzy planets with a bullet riding centerpiece
I'm bout as sick of burning find the hottest slacker in a visionary costume
Con artist kamikaze conduct
Warm for a second to the minute he whored herself to disaster
I recognize the cankers by the mechanical stagger
As opposed to the skip of big brother bad slasher
I'll be god while you're still living life on a full 40
I drink a bad glass of gumption
Spit sob stories to confront my dick addictions
Of the dirty basement at the graves of Salem witches
And a magic dragon sack of dirty shrubbery
I'll be the ugliest version of paranoia
Kingpin set in motion by the secondhand pressure
Some get excited when the sun folds under
Some get excited when the summer hits the pavement
Some get excited when the bullets hits bone and a board
I'll escape through the train yard and sleep till it's broken
This be the settling of debt of warm water
Somebody mad enough to cut apart the curtain with a fist up
This is the dagger in the 88 magnificent memorial
This is the heater to a movement
When I broke fifth thousand sparks
Somebody fresh enough to reinvent the court with a fist up
The bum's dumb blitzed
Order in the court where the mortars jump bricks
The venom remains the same game of stale toxins
And perfect syncopated burnt to crispy critters
Like synchronized swimmers in boric rivers
He surfs city circuits for the power and the glory
His ink sleeps while the military look tough
It goes spit on CNN and force the war back through the cable box
I dead opinions and swap it out for the urges
Enough Hell for the world's hand baskets
Switch for element of surprise and demise
Murder the fads before the fads murder you and yours
So when the nozzles hit his nostrils
The thorns are real the anger management is not
Enough Hell for the world's hand baskets
These are not his office hours
What he coughs is mandatory
Three obnoxious hawks and howlers
Roughly buff the categories
And matador electric tongue stung at sergeant markers sour
Duck and a phoenix and rout behemoth architecture out the jungle
Where my condors can reorganize their numbers
And bazooka flash the grin she decorate the closest Nikon
Get your stolen drums on
And let the medallion of spiritual accomplishments keep growing
Aesop Rock is all ears
Dear lord holler at me
All I know is hell is down and god don't cover doctoral fees
But I will not stand for the flipping of a weighted coin
Radar for the crazy oink
And that my good people is my piece
There's only one in all the shaking hands you do
Same hand that snuggled the barbed wire
Beautiful loser maneuver the goofy cubicle future alert
Darwin on a peg taking his innervate to tag along
And it was home depot for the five finger lazy lift
Ironically the same five measure the spray radius
Now mobile roads develop a special network
Tonight the scum dance and I got all my money on the one with the lung cramps
It's written by a messenger pigeon to hell's kitchen
Clap once for the junkyard punks
This is what I sound like alive
So when the jungle hits the city every insect is alive
Poison for the town square and by the stinger needle
Dumb it down for none but none dumber
Grassroots schools always kept it simple
Pour the water in the dirt then observe the impulse
You will need it to lick wounds
I have brown hair and green eyes
In august of 2-0-0-1 I went crazy...
This was originally not for public consumption
This was made for four people... four people that literally saved my life
They know who they are...
I don't think this song would pay them
To the cold hard concrete on near bodega trips
Rose rapidly out a bog I'd never fished in
While I use the hook line and sinker simple fishing
Shrinks that get 250 an hour for awkward silence
Made even the slightest fragment of sense to me
That's real... Simply put
I literally feel like I'm teetering on the blunt edge of my sanity
But you lent a heart and hand that only you could
You're one of my best friends and yes I'd take that bullet for you
And I got your back if ever the drunk goblin step
Letting me know I wasn't the only one with this
Talked me through repair of a head full of broken pistons
You listened to me blab about my issues for hours
But I could tell you that I only write shit down when I believe it
I want you all to know that I'm scared
But the pieces won't formulate it to anything even close to cohesive
So I guess this is my feeble way to thank you
Four soldiers that extended something sacred off the purity of kindness
I owe you all my life and please don't argue with that statement
Just gotta figure this all out... So...
I guess it is kind of funny when you look at it from a step back
How one man can literally buckle under the same pressures
Other men operate normally under
I am lucky enough to have those people around me
Thank you for helping me to not die
Thank you for helping me to not die
The bully cycles dig the stitch in
Rig the hitch in golden theory
Lift the bridge and sink
Link the fink divisions ink transmission with a jinx
Instead of tripping off the ways glitter blinks
The book had mentioned several separate crafts that mobilize to clash defendants
I'm touching oxblood skies over my city which hover in blue disguise
The dry season New York's five reasons flock to the marketplace
Targets chase targets oblivious to if they heart a splash of bull's eye
I nab a nauseating caution
Peddle on exhausted levels
Tore in the cure that fits
Governed beneath the cherished checks and balances routine
The daggers that rip that bond are the sharpest
Wishbone on an Earth hungry for flesh
While tyrants hug upon their broadcast treasure guardians
Graceful ascension over
Wasteful intervention
This little pig hides behind his faithful train collection
Bends the tension in trip wires at every landmark
I discipline the workers in my colony with glorious intention to live
I discipline the workers in my colony with glorious intention to write
It's like pillars line these aisles with chrome gates
I scrape the pennies out my back pocket for needy drunks
Like low riders scrape their bellies on speed bumps
I saw the sunlight riding in harmed
Keep in mind this flow is used for practice.
Far as I know we've been blacklist
For as long as the earth rotate on a 23 degree axis.
I can stop any time I want to.
Famous last words that came back to haunt you
Some cats get it like no bright ideas.
He broke the record then bowed.
Even took the time to contaminate the rhyme scene
It's no use. Blessed to design
Well we'll see after these criminals who falls.
Ball to ball and we'll be needing new drawers.
Keep in mind this flow is used for practice.
Far as I know we've been blacklist
For as long as the earth rotate on a 23 degree axis.
All in it together now.
Some of the misadventures of a father crop
Bound to tackles when a battle runs in circles
Like rodeo clowns with paddles.
Poked in the belly by petty sarcasm.
Push pins for the lab rat breed.
The hacker mass will have seen there's more to life.
Let's recreate a perfect service rooted in labor lust
And a discipline prisoner.
I don't work a thick antithesis.
Parallel park your burning prod adjacent
To the flagrant iron ego valve
Let us study a weaker outlet
Asking where's the closest war and how to make it sleep
God made me a fine instrument of style
Don't make me holy sleep bolts blindly until your mood shifts.
Purple skeleton key immunity systems.
That's why I do my best to stay quiet
Keep in mind this flow is used for practice.
Far as I know we've been blacklist
I'm about to be a millionaire
You got your window wide open like it's sunny outside
Forty millimeter shells in the heater well
Gather up my thoughts so I don't go wrong
Most people get it whenever they play it back
The force of the one two roll wit I
is gold with no frills
And roadkill bake over BK blacktop
To settle in a worm lunch lovely and vile
Half never even got comfy in a style
And it works for a while when a stone cold serf
Free every worker immersed in denial
And never ever once turn worship and bow
Hopped out the Ford for more folklore
Please don't tap the phone and go
No lights on but the cat is home
Try to coax thick money out the rabbit hole
And it's a diary of savage folk with no future
With a little killer pill and no tolerance for the tipsy
I was dragging a dagger through the dim city dregs
With a blacksmith cough and a box of cassettes
I was hopped up heading for the last of the lights
With a sweaty upper lip on a midsummer's night
This be the dawning of the age of dead water
Somebody live enough to bust through the belly with a fist up
This is a right now generation murdered by the fan base
With a still force activated
Formed by the village of badness and bad karma
Punched by the stagnant water gate threw the fickle back
But by the window's still three nickels in a piggy bank
Caught her with her head up funny stomach from the hunger pains
In a matchbox apartment adjacent a crooked starship
Doomed and bitter nation and a million's the only remedy
Nine dizzy planets with a bullet riding centerpiece
I'm bout as sick of burning find the hottest slacker in a visionary costume
Con artist kamikaze conduct
Warm for a second to the minute he whored herself to disaster
I recognize the cankers by the mechanical stagger
As opposed to the skip of big brother bad slapper
Wet with a mouthful of better ideas and see if it tipped zero
I'll be god while you're still living life on a full 40
I drink a bad glass of gumption
Spit sob stories to confront my dick addictions
Of the dirty basement at the graves of Salem witches
And a magic dragon sack of dirty shrubbery
I'll be the ugliest version of paranoia
Kingpin set in motion by the secondhand pressure
Some get excited when the sun folds under
Some get excited when the summer hits the pavement
I'll escape through the train yard and sleep till it's broken
This be the settling of debt of warm water
Somebody mad enough to cut apart the curtain with a fist up
This is the dagger in the 88 magnificent memorial
This is the heater to a movement
When I broke to the fifth sparks
Somebody fresh enough to reinvent the court with a fist up
I think it was the tragedies of science versus the world's technical marvels
Barrel in escorted by a chorus line of bedbugs
We come in pieces under siege and unwilling
And you can see a sitting duck grow up into a baying wolf
Teller Number 7 looking weathered
Like a decade in a glass box yelling shook her feathers
Gotta fly in the morning
Raging bull mad truck never bagging the rain kill
Slowly let the dogs out quicker than finish Halo
My snout turned up from dream factory eyelids
Yeah rocks the match that burned the Nazi journals
Models then swallowed by famished potholes
Tied up on these functions
When Little Billy bought a Tugboat
Now he thinks he's Captain Ahab
Wonder why you wept over spilled milk
Connecting life with that little species of idiots
We've now officially scraped barrel bottom
Aesop Rock an Apple to the core but y'all ignored him
I know a planet made of porcelain
And once I get tired of holding this gavel up
Y'all prayer circles met him up born again
I ain't too good for tap water
You can lead a man to a city but that don't assure civility
I speak in Fahrenheit and burn off colon lyric
Platforms have been erected
Rumors have been circulated
The hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape
Moving boxes have been worn out
Curtains have been closed
The hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape
I picked locks of thoughts vault
Finding the garden barren
The harvest fruitless
Only the Tree of Life flourishing
Wanting to take a bite but I'm toothless
That I'm trapped in time sand
Show radio mission control but for my rhymes
And I recycle my consciousness
For any action or lack thereof there's a consequence
With halos in your syringe
Celestial ground is found broken
Exposing a bottomless depth
Where heartless spines awake to devour
The small piece of your soul that's left
You're immersed in sound floating
Drop anchor to gain stability
Pedestal talk is a token
The night breathes but light's choking
Darkness occupies the throne
Where poems are persecuted
To cause heat to rise and wonder why they're trapped in cold
And as society's fabric of orthodoxes dismantle
I'll see you embracing the pentagram within this crucifix disguise
See when the canvas stands before me
I'm compelled to spill a vision
Still my pen bleeds and stains the paper with thought
Finding me lost among statues of mainstream idols
Drowning in melted ice to reinforce that breath is vital
If your father and his father were fish out of water
You must break the cycle
When it's smothered with lies that abolish the potency of the sky
So when the stars burn out and God replaces the bulbs
Hurting new giants and flocks
I stand on my own two aura illuminated in red
Showcasing the agony held within this welded spirit
Yearning for the truth that we speak but refuse to hear it
Platforms have been erected
Rumors have been circulated
The hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape
Moving boxes have been worn out
Curtains have been closed
I forever wallow in glitches grimly distributed by side effects
Synthesized lies rise synthetic
Yellow brick stalker walking shifty
Your petty soldiers seem fragile like Giacometti sculptures
My wingspan stands flags in the snow of the poles
Swerve my alignment towards solitary confinement and jade it
Paws curled beneath your head
Till the sun came round just around noon
Drawing up your tail around my hips
And I would go to your mouth wide open
For the love of my personal practice I reside
Slide fuel by the fury
Spun a ring around my honor
But the opulence took shelter in my horror
Melancholy masquerade
And blazing terror that blew the lock down off my placement
I stay special agent till the sky falls
Reverse the curse till my fellow lost children disperse
And your footsteps leading down the pathway
Never seem to be quite like my own
It blinded me till I turned towards home
And you would watch me far in the distance
Hands held high above your head
I make music and connect color to canvas
Swoop down from the trees with potpourris and other bandits
Landed randomly upon the valleys of the grimace
Meaning your clout lies thin
That sting never fades like belly wounds from sling blades
A righteous infliction of retribution
Manifested by an appropriate agent...
Just a couple subdivisions who naturally hate each other
Friendship is Professor Plum ratting on Colonel Mustard
You are now witnessing the world's most craft version
Arm mortars and field mines for a bastard sledge
On the style diamond cutter
You fidget like a nervous culprit gulping
Fake as the grass with a sturdy belly and his work to sell me
I got my word to tell you
For the forks like pistons pumping through the realm my family habits
I hold words for ransom
Demand some attention pays
Not to mention praise for their release on a page
It might amaze the light of day
More insight to behave
Whose ads have been paid for by some brothers
While some of us lie in the eyes of others
I discovered another way to stay undercover
Whether a clean getaway is harder to make
Than a call to the cleaners
Dropped off a seamless bag
Zipped it up with enough cash to pay the cat
With the aqua demeanor
God is a name I call myself
I breathe rusty air logic
I'll ball your rhyme up and stuff it inside my mouth
And you'll just stand there
But I think life is more than a jail sentence
Doing calisthenics which euphemisms to hand out a life sentence
And you in a glass bottom boat with a crack in it
So fuck your attitude
My poetry's position is the sole definition of latitude
An evil so singular personified as you being hit
Take me to the basement
Let me count the holes in your foundation
The perch of rare grimace on iron mask
I remember science class
If chemistry could silence the lions laugh I'd be fine
Adrenaline trades the leaves that walk the plank
Before the crimson struck a match this season
Meridian carpal will jolt your logic
When the burn earned its self normalcy for 20 plus
She applied the lipstick slow
Slow enough for me to bask in
Fast enough for me to wish it lasted
Past my alarms cackling
The front line of its mystique's geek
Well that'll sip the blood of merry men
That'll grace holiday carols when the merry ends
And pirate your local rain puddle torturous
Try to shake pilot fish off your dorsal fin
Stamp it with a notable brand to reek the profit
See I don't know hell but I've read about it often
Sounds like a dope concept gone wrong
Take Me to the basement
Lets zoom into that war paint sensation
Take Me to the basement
Take Me to the basement
Take Me to the basement
Lets review the hearts ramifications
Take me to the basement
Lets remove the costume you escaped in
I'll teach you about the perks of patience in seminar format
I've worn that hat for seven years
I ain't about to toss when it's been through all these dream wars with me
I rather starve then sit inside this gridlock till it parts
It's tied around my neck like 13 loops rafter an apple box
How many freezer burn victims can one society on tilt manufacture
And every tree trunks made of third rails with tourniquet branches
And I learned to walk with an anchor in my back pocket
And man I read palms during even the most brief handshakes
And man I ain't alive to pull the weeds around the spotlit
Conquering these open roads with throttle pin to floor
Take Me to the basement
Lets zoom into that war paint sensation
Take Me to the basement
Take Me to the basement
Take Me to the basement
Lets review the hearts ramifications
Get up to get down now
I don't wanna do it anymore
I don't wanna do it anymore
Couldn't do it if I tried...
Lucy was in the sky with diamonds
Five dollars to hold them
Back to back like Mad Hatter magic
Splatter bachelor fabric fatter with Cabbage Patch lit
What's fouler was the other farmhands growing gills and shark fangs
What's fouler was my torso stripped to ribbons in the marshlands
Let's get this window pane and shut the fuck down
Down by the river where the litter sits
Twelve hour solid gold entertainment
Other shit to sell from other ships that sell they DD paper
This one's for the labor days worked for rent and rolling papers
Whistle while you work like a canary lung
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy to carry drugs
I sorta see it as my last flash summer
Skateboards and sloppy psychedelics and big numbers
All airbrushed on a collapsible easel
And I knew the gash wasn't gonna stop bleeding
And I knew how September would then affect it
Last sturdy domino leans secluded
Dragnet lifer solutions
Little soldiers developed like serpents despite life sentence ducking
Some don't like sobriety's dirty lenses
Some do let sleeping dogs lie still
Don't look so damn lackluster
Lost summer's display laminate showcasing divinity
Live system definitive
They've got angels sweating like Helots
Working their little halos to the bones combing them deserts
My figure eight knotted lifeline defined traffic
The way my schooling innocently defined every day
One exquisite fit a crisis rivets an octagon of red
To the ceiling above my bed. It's not a conversation piece
Strung a hammock between spring and where the willows turn to blood
Might a worm sip a little litter and love it
Without big beetles trying to sell him sunflower seeds by the bucket
Without hot air balloons floating their four passenger baskets
And I'm asking you to let a captive lacerate a caption
Splash out massive upholster plastic glasses with famine patches
And for a second taste of pain when removing that crown of thorns
Pacifists huddled in subtle masochist stamp the blame on following an inkling
My fire escape overlooks ghost town market place
Martyrs bought out passes then fasten selves to the target face
So my feet would stay dry when God's wine glass tilts
And I'll be hiding when his drunken stupor lands upon earth
And a colony of crazes raised to justify the grimace
Watch the eagles board the little engine that could not
Ghost in a shell and it fell in my lap
I lead a fleet to blaze exact songs directly into the village power supply
Burning the bridge between the magnet and my eye
I can count my own dusty nickels with you laughing
About you'll turn my poor ass ebony and navy with cane lashings
Binging on rancid baits mummified well inside a muddy New York minute
I am not your friend anymore
My arrowhead dissertation when narrow bed sleepers occupy the basement
And I am not your friend anymore
I'd board myself inside my room to trace the wilting contour
Tied to irony like twenty burning igloos with a sailor's knot
Fiddler crabs build sandcastles while high tide off azalea crops
Well if it ain't finally a question that's worth answering
Man who walks my block in rainstorms with plastic bags on his feet
See I've thrown away the tenders over one shoulder and walk across broken glass
Through every wicked world to kiss tomorrow's morning. Not for nothing
You'll drown in a pool of your crooked morals whispering
I hug a half empty glass my dignity's trying to pawn her
I'm trying to see the future in a tea cup and a saucer
But I'd rather be drinking coffee with my cigarette foster
And magically mastered the great absorbing of spirits falling
But I'm sick I've plowed these fields a thousand times over
Sold botanical research studies to farmers with whole quotas
And when science proposes to art besides that peaceful sea
I'll be that cat with a ring on a pillow shouting finally
A hundred thousand freaks on parade for the village hunter
My every whim acted upon has gone loopy
Sleeping fossil genie bottle optimist freeze
Run for the fountain but the fountain is a desert optical tease
Tummy full of sand running man impossible stop
There's a wing in my gut and I'm all dust
Now one in the hand's worth two atop the tallest cedar
But what's lodged inside my heart is off the motherfucking meter
And the Water ain't safe no more
See the water ain't safe no more
See the water ain't safe no more
The Water ain't safe no more
Rusted hook in the lip of the monarch
I don't play in the man race cycle
Gloating inside carnal indifference till doom cops a slot
I'm 20 something pumping acrylic tomorrow sideways
Blazing passage with a map tattooed on the back of the classless
Because a lost cause found
Don't mean you found a cause
That means you found a lost cause
Slaying my here and now
To benefit consumption for my peers steering the plow
Handy jackets turn numerals to sentinels
But bad apples ain't sweet
And cretin saddles ain't that memorable
I'm Mozart with a focus on the tide
Hiding the inconsistencies of man behind water and wine
I wear a tiger striped ego and bivouac my progression
Where the kindling's formulated through the flesh of the oppressors
You really think the 13 loops that noose honored
Addressed the ghost inside my TV with a ruler
Here ten thousand hackers deep in the movement
That's 20,000 crucial ruby heels clicking in unison
I keep a stick inside my hand
And carve my name inside every wall of the falling hologram
See the Water ain't safe no more
I can prove it see the water ain't safe no more
Just get on down and hit me

Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age for renegades
Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age for renegades
Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
On down through the Middle Ages
When the earth kept going through changes
Cars continue to change
There were always renegades
They were renegades of the atomic age
From a different solar system
We are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation
And we're on this musical message
To help the others listen
Improve momentum and seek
Like the Zulu station
Like destroy all nations
Nothing stays the same
Now renegades are people
With their own philosophy
They change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me
You know they have their secret notions
And time is endless motion
All people of the moderate ages
Here in this twentieth century
You have to keep up in time
With the moderate time
A state of mind and a sense of pride
So many renegades who's that
Now hand clap the renegades
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're teachers of the funk
And not of empty popping
We're blessed with the Force
And the sight of electronics
The horns and our vocals
You know every time we pop
Into the beat we get fresh
There was a time when our music
Was something called the Bay Street beat
People would gather from all around
To get down on the Bay sound
You had to be a renegade those days
To take a man on the dance floor
So many renegades what's that
It's a hand clap the renegade
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
He's a renegade of funk
He's a renegade of funk
He's a renegade of funk
He's a renegade of funk
In a musical sense if you get right to it
It's timely situation with your own creation
We are the gun and thunder
We're on the same mission
Come on everybody listen
People all across the nation
Who thinks they have imagination
Everyone wants to see you groove
And cause your frantic body to move
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation
Let's all get together and rock along
Twist and scream and shout
Now do what you came here to
In order to get ready you gotta get loose
Ain't masturbation it's a proclamation
All across the nation it's a happy situation
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation
Are you ready for the new age
They are setting the stage for the renegades
Zulu nation here to stay

Just get on down and hit me
Every piece of the world
Rate the message of the worlds
Do what ya want but ya know
Ya got to be cool and boogie
Work it all around the clock
Work it all around the clock
Who said we don't have no quality
To rock the house and with the greatest of ease
Now I'm the Master Ice and I'm twice as nicer
And the dedicated prince of the disco slice
As you can see I'm formally known
As the rodeo rock of the microphone
That my quality rank's about 100 Proof
And for all of y'all who like to duplicate
I had to return to set the story straight
No other guy or dame could ever play the game
MC Master Gee and I'm the singer of the crew
And I'm the Master B as you will see
I hold the key to the door of society
But if you listen up close you will agree
A presidential rapper with a lot of finesse
Go high and low and do The Gigolo
Then you come back up and look your partner in the eyes
Listen party people all across the nation
And you don't stop that Body Rock
We're in the building
Where they make us grow
And I'm frightened by
I could crawl around the floor
I could learn to be a man
Oh everything is moving.
It's tomorrow they send me
If I could make the change
I'd love to pull the wires from the wall
Here inside I like metal
My heart jump and move
Walk over said to her
She said I was a fool
This is not the right time baby
I came here to groove
The girls had made a move
Why didn't you make your move
And stole the girl from you
So come on and get down
You are entitled to flaunt
Get wild and reckless
The partner she was with
He did not know how to gig
Mister get away from me
That knows how to move
Suddenly a quick romance
Why didn't you make your move
And stole the girl from you
That you should discover
You can't trust a girl
Or judge them by the cover
And keep you in a daze
Keep you head over heels
Whether you fall in the trap
Just remember when you push up
Things are real funny
You can bet more than all she wants
So listen to what I say
Girls are the same everywhere
You can bet all they want from you
You can bet that you've tried her
They'll leave you penniless
The human race is becoming a disgrace.
Countries are fighting with chemical warfare.
Not giving a damn about the people who live.
Nostradamus predicts the coming of the Antichrist.
Won't stand in the way of the Islamic force.
The CIA is looking for other detectives.
The KGB is smarter than you think.
Brainwash mentalities to control the system.
This is a world destruction. Your life ain't nothing.
The human race is becoming a disgrace.
The poor are getting poorer.
Are in a time zone just searching for the truth.
Facing forth your everlasting doom.
We are Time Zone. We've come to drop a bomb on you.
The human race is becoming a disgrace.
Nationalities are fighting with each other.
Putting people in faceless categories.
Knowledge isn't what it used to be.
Military tactics to control a nation.
Mother Nature is gonna work against you.
Nothing in your power that you can do.
We party all night to the people's delight
Cause everybody knows that we rock out of sight
Say we are the best in the creation
We go by the name of the Mighty Zulu Nation
We're worldwide and we're citywide
That my mellow Smitty D is on the echo
We do a routine and put on a show
And we dedicate it to the people we know
The Zulu Nation say time after time
We rock in the sunlight or any kind of weather
We got to amaze all you people that we're one hell of a sight
So check out the way we introduce ourselves
MC Chubby Chub from the heavens above
Now all you young ladies get sexy
This is a story from the yesteryear
Until we climb the ladder say one by one
Say we change the tempo so you can clap your hands
So put your hands in the air and listen to me
Cause you listen to the voice of MC Lisa Lee
When you came through the door we gave you a smile
We're gonna paralyze your mind and put you in shock
We're gonna let you know without a doubt
Exactly what we be about
Make the ants crawl in your pants
Put you in a music trance
Listen to the beat and let yourself go
This ain't a Broadway play or a high school plot
It's the real deal that makes you feel
Now party people in the place you feel the bass
To show everybody that you can dance
These are the devastating words that you never heard before
So won't you clap your hands and have some fun
Say I didn't come here to ask for your love
To me she'll always be my superstar
And a young lady that's worth my while
That we always rock and we can't be stopped
Wherever we rock and hit the latest spot
I said that we're the crew that leads the pack
And we'll teach ya lessons that you'll never forget
We're on to the crack of dawn
We're on to the crack of dawn
That thing that you call that body rock
She had long hair and clothes so fine
And the way she moved was like a graceful swan
And we can make love to the break of dawn
And the way she move is like a graceful dove
Get on the dance floor
Let your body feel the heat
So your feet can feel the beat
And let me see your body move
When we walk into a party
All the ladies stop and pause
Homeboys give us high fives
We came to express our feelings
So throw your hands high in the air
By the Scores transatlantic like Arabs and Berbers Warriors slash black Lord carrying Torches
map the warpath Blackboards attack your Fortress back to back in the soldiers Quarters
following Orders draw Swords as we forge Borders and want more for our Sons and Daughters.
Snatch your Purse if you've got more yearning to floss smack you worse than your Papa no Words lost.
Nazis wanna murder him
bombs on the premises
and the fire be regardless
It all began up in 100 Dwight
And at the end I would win lots of pots of gold
Everybody who knows me know I paid the cost for fame
Some nights I shed tears when I said my prayers
Been shot a lot of times for slinging nickels and dimes
On the road to the riches that was paved with crime
we came a long way up fighting court cases
At 8 years old that was my first hip hop encounter
Then I went on playing keyboards with Adam Ellis
He was the nicest emcee in The Hook
Used to to from block to block to battle and people would Crowd us
I was always a ghetto star and highly respected
Another MC lose his life tonight
Another MC lose his life tonight
Another MC lose his life tonight
Another MC lose his life tonight
This is our roots boy straight from Berlin
Another MC lose his life tonight
Another MC lose his life tonight
IT TAKES A NATION OF MILLIONS TO HOLD US BACK.
Please take me back home To Mississippi
Please take me back home To Mississippi
I stayed in a place called Palmer's Crossing
Buy my rap tape tomorrow
Request my tape when you go inside
So I can take Jane and girl
Leave with their Auntie Sheryl
She sucks me sucks me
But I hops in the Coup
Pinch the nipples on her tit again
Suck my dick until she spit again
Please take me back home To Mississippi
Please take me back home To Mississippi
From the delta to the coast
Separate me from my bitch and shit
Officer Roscoe P. Coltrane
But I can't be no hip hop star
Cuffed in the back of some police car
Let's all get drunk tonight
I hope I don't fight with a punk tonight
Hope I don't crash when I hit Pedal
Get my ass kicked in the white ghetto
Prejudice police won't let me go
Got a phone call from Nikki and June
All these pretty women that I meet in Wiggins
I got my dick down some girl's throat
I can't help it It's a trip baby
I think you need to wipe your lip baby
The whole house ruler
Geri curl activator in my hair
I'm in control like Janet when I hit Jackson
Tell the whole world Mississippi's your home
Depend on me like my name was patches
With all the Hillbillies
Confederate flags tobacco in their mouth
I'll make your girlfriend holler and scream
Then cook me some cornbread and collard greens
Drinking everyday like I'm supposed to
Sing that one more time
To make a long story short
I like the skinny girl
I like the college girl
I like the church girl
When they're beautiful
I'm the hungry hustler
I like the wrong girl
I like the right girl
I like the black girl
I like the white girl
I like the brown girl
I like the yellow girl
I like the ghetto girl
I even got a green girl
I like the country girl
Don't let me get high and
Get the munchies girl
I'm a have me a woman
A man I wrote this rap
About Little Red Riding Hood
When I was a little kid
We took a ride to my hood
And I rode her real good
Like Martin Luther King
I said boom bang pop pow
When you're on all fours
Like a horse on her hoof
The most precious commodity
My brain's like the ocean
But nothing is swimming
I wanna have sex with you
When we was little kids
My girl got two big lips
Taste like potato chips
My girl got two big boobs
My girl got two big hips
Just like two battleships
My girl got real long hair
Down to her underwear
My girl gotta slender waste
When you born in this world
You get these people that you coincidently grow up with
And you get this illusion of friendship
You know what I'm saying man
You notice people trying to like manipulate you
Then all of the sudden homeboy
You know I gotta get on down
Aw yeah aw yeah aw yeah
We don't kick it no more
You need to pay me back my ends
Cause you ain't my friend
Cause you ain't my friend
Cause you ain't my friend
But you ain't my friend
But you ain't my friend
Cause you ain't my friend
Never visit me in jail
Cause you ain't my friend
When it comes to friends I ain't got none
All I got is a double barrel shotgun
I can't stand a useless man that has no plan
Fools always act like they down with me
Flip about four or five pounds with me
Get a motel sleep on the ground with me
But when I get back with my money stacked
I used to be a gang member
I don't trust he she him nor her
There's no honor among thieves
Everybody got tricks up they sleeves
You say you my friend but that's a bunch of noise
Be the first one to rat to the police man
Just when you think you've found a buddy
Now isn't this an excellent adventure
He turned on you like a Doberman pincher
I can't hang with y'all and drink alcohol
Get into a brawl over nothing at all
I got plans but you don't believe em
I ain't got no family
I ain't got no friends
Only thing that I have
Is a big fat bottle of gin
Make me feel all right
Make me feel all right
Soothe me till I'm satisfied
Yeah make me feel all right
Nobody loves me but my mama
And I think she's lying too
I could never be your friend homeboy
And I ain't trying to
But whatever you need
I'm so glad I'm glad that trouble don't last always
He used to grow his vegetables right there on the side of the house
And sometime he'd sing the same one like over and over and over again
It gets all in my hands
It gets all in my feet
It makes me wanna sing my song
To every little girl I meet
It gets all in my heart
It gets all in my sole
It comes straight out my mouth
And then I lose control
Damn how long is it gonna take you to roll a joint cuss
It puts ma mind at ease indulging ma self in the calm breeze
N ma problems will float away beyond the palm trees
N ma problems will blow away like a plastic bag
I gotta lie to the man
I gotta go to the clinic baby
I got no food for ma stomach
I gotta walk to the supermarket for some golden seed
I swallowed another tab
I might overdose under the circumstance
All I wanna do is get high
Between your legs is where my brain is at
I used to smoke marijuana when I was a kid
I'm high on every drug known to mankind
So go ahead and pass it
My designated driver was this girl
All she wants to do is get high
Between her legs is where my brain is at
This butt naked girl sat next to me
And offered me some ecstasy
Then she gave me a big fat kiss with a mouth full of LSD
Wave your hands in the air
Then wave it like you just don't care
If you got on clean underwear somebody say oh yeah
And Robert Smith from the cure right
Maybe I didn't fuck you
But little darling don't cry
The fact is I masturbated
About an hour before you came by
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Open up your legs and let me stick it in
My favorite past time is making love to my girlfriend
I can't wait to shoot my load again
She won't let me fuck
I really need to bust a nut
She won't let me fuck
I really need to bust a nut
I really need to bust a nut
I'll give you my money
The wrong message I hope I'm not sending. Laughing and pretending my dick's not extending
Don't make me cry. Look into my eye
Love to sag my khakis with a tall can
We the loudest homeboys in my neighborhood
We look real bad but we feel so good
Always gotta bad attitude
You see I can't wait around till I get rich
I stepped into this party full of Mexicans
I didn't realize I was the only black man
I think she was embarrassed with the eight ball in my cup
I knew if I moved I was officially dead
Ain't the first time that I got confronted
Love to sag my khakis with a tall can
Now we the loudest homeboys in my neighborhood
We look real bad but we feel so good
Always gotta bad attitude
You see I can't wait around till I get rich
I was gonna eat her out but then I got high
In the slums of LA by the way
Had a ball to bounce plus a bike to ride
But when I got enrolled in elementary school
Shot an enemy from across the street
No more rats and no more roaches
Now I got a new place to sell me crack
Now I got little white kids to jack
I didn't really care if I passed or failed
I knew I was headed for the NFL
I knew I couldn't make it in the white man's world
So I bought me some khakis and a Geri curl
I knew I couldn't make it to the NFL
Now I deliver like Pizza Hut
I sold dope to anybody
A white man drove up to my spot
I put a fat rock inside his hand
About 25 sheriffs jumped out the van
Bloods wanna eat my Snicker bars
So I jumped off the bed
Jammed his head up against the bunk
Sheriff broke it up when we hit the floor
Won't hesitate to get in a scrap
Now I got a fucked up life
Dead end job at the airport
Check too short to pay the house note
Then I see different homeboys that went to school with me
Zeno plays for Colorado State
I wish my homeboys much success
Graveyard shift ain't never dead
We go to work when people go to bed
We got tremendous work overload
The boss don't care about the dress code
That it's almost time for lunch
Nobody gets offended at a racial joke
Nobody cares on the graveyard shift
On the graveyard shift
On the graveyard shift
You don't have to slave too hard
Play the radio just a little bit louder
Got the homeboys in a Soul Train line
You wanna act crazy go ahead and be wild
If you wanna rap go ahead and freestyle
The beer is on the house from the Corporate World
Act like a fool till the break of dawn
Nobody cares on the graveyard shift
I never would work on daytime
Graveyard shift is my playtime
Daytime jobs are flaky
Daytime jobs are shaky
So I work graveyard like a skeleton
I drive to work without a traffic jam
Everybody on the graveyard is like my brother
If your car breaks down I'll give you a ride
To the people at the bottom of the totem pole
And if you need somebody to get drunk with
Call the homeboys from the graveyard shift
Happiness is hard to find
Happiness is a state of mind.
It can't be found in fame or wealth
It's found real deep inside yourself
Throw parties and barbecues
Play with your kids and make love to your wife.
Have a good time before Christ comes back.
I'll see you Sunday night for the graveyard shift.
We gotta get over some kinda way
I am the American Dream. Even though the government tried to experiment with me
But I'm still the American Dream.
Because I was considered a distraction to the educational process.
And I'm still the American Dream.
But I'm still the American Dream.
But I am still the American Dream.
And I am still the American Dream.
There's a lot of people out there who can identify with me.
But you are still the American Dream.
But you are still the American Dream.
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the Underground Category.
My mind has been delivered.
Now I got a new place to sell my crack. Now I got little white kids to jack.
I drunk whiskey and Bacardi. I sold dope to anybody.
I put a fat rock inside his hand. About 25 sheriffs jumped out the van.
Dead end job at the airport. Check too short to pay the house note.
Rodney Williams. Lorenz Tate. Zeno plays for Colorado State.
I got a bag of weed and a bottle of wine. I'm a fuck that bitch just one more time.
Don't be amazed at the stories I tell ya. I met a woman in the heart of Australia.
I came in her mouth. It was a crisis. I gave her my secret blend of herbs and spices.
Let's go to the club tonight. Find a woman that wanna make love tonight.
Hope I don't wreck when my vision gets blurry. Sober up looking at an all white jury.
Judge don't like no drunk like me. Punk might give me strike number three.
It's Friday night. Got the perfect weather. Let's get drunk together.
Let's go to the club tonight. Find a woman that wanna make love tonight.
Let's go to the club tonight. Find a woman that wanna make love tonight.
Let's go to the club tonight. Find a woman that wanna make love tonight.
Let's all get drunk tonight. I hope I don't fight with a punk tonight.
Let's all get high tonight. Maybe nobody will die tonight.
Let's all sell yell tonight. I hope I don't go back to jail tonight.
And I really want to put a woman like you... somewhere on my team
And it's a trip when a stripper start to strip
All the home boys feel obligated to tip
I'm a stingy black boy from the year two thousand
Take her to the wrong neighborhood way across town...
Last night she sucked my dick...
A few words of inspiration
This song is dedicated to hustlers standing on the curb
Sip your beer wipe your tears encourage your peers it's gonna be all right
Everything is gonna be all right sell your dope make your money every night
Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight
You and your girl argue every night sell
Your dope especially when your pockets tight
Sell your dope brother you know this world ain't right
To buy some beer and a couple of strippers
You can use my car till you find another
Can't wait till you get home but later on
That money you get from your GR check
Should be enough to put you back on deck
Now I know you on parole but don't be scared
This time we be prepared
Fuck the feds don't say shit to your broad
Keep your dope stashed in your neighbors yard
When they kick in the door with they steel toed boot
Everything is gonna be aright SELL YOUR DOPE
Make your money every night
Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight
You and your girl argue every night
Sell your dope especially when your pockets tight
Sell your dope brother you know this world ain't right
Your baby momma she might trip
She can't help a black man out
But when bills come around she's got her hand out
Plus you need rims for your Cadillac
We can expand by a little land
Hand the dope game down to the next man
Buy a little business clean the money
Look at the cops funny hey hey hey
We can dance underwater and not get wet
Everything is gonna be aright SELL YOUR DOPE
Make your money every night
Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight
You and your girl argue every night
Sell your dope especially when your pockets tight
Sell your dope brother you know this world ain't right
Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight
You and your girl argue every night
Sell your dope especially when your pockets tight
Sell your dope brother you know this world ain't right
I chop up some quarter pieces and get ready for my cluck heads
I sell it all day baby I sell it all night long
Till the 15th comes around and everybody is all gone
Baby don't try to change me if I go to the pen
Everything is gonna be aright SELL YOUR DOPE
Make your money every night
Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight
You and your girl argue every night
Sell your dope especially when your pockets tight
Life's gonna hand you a bill one day
Before your freedom or your life get took
Get a wife or a playboy book
There's a price to pay for the girls you lay
Life's gonna hand you a bill one day
Before your freedom or your life get took
Her number I demanded
The questions I asked her were nice and discrete
But now she's in my passenger seat
Fucked without a hassle
I loved the way she sucked my reproductive organ
I road it and road it
Went to the bathroom because I couldn't hold it
Off the tip of my penis
It don't take a genius to figure she's a virgin
Scrubbed my dick with detergent
Your nipples are hard
But her mama standing in the front yard
I look kinda old with a fro and a beard
She looked at me as if I was Satan
That shit I did was a felony
Maybe you can release your rap tape
When you through doing time for statutory rape
She was nice and slim
She got a man but she don't talk to him
Sniff that pussy you can probably smell it
Fired up the engine went to my house
With a slow tempo I fucked the broad
Oh my god this girl is odd
Lost my vision as I shot my wad
I gotta get rid of this hood rat
It's time for this bitch to take her ass home
No more Luther or S. Gate
I said wait a minute woman
She said I'm single I don't play that shit
You gotta call me first before you come by
But we was disturbed by a knock on the door
But now I'm caught in some chaos
But now I'm caught in some chaos
And you invited me in
Now look at the shape I'm in
I stood up fool I couldn't take the suspense
I walked to the door kinda nervous
I'm not ready for a funeral service
I got eye contact with the fool
She talked about him as if he was small
Come to find out he like seven feet tall
He gave me a pound with his hand
I walked right past the man
Drove down the street then I never came back
Before I have to go to jail
Before somebody go and snitch
I'm so paranoid stressed stressed paranoid paranoid
I avoid the cops I use a decoy
I'm so paranoid stressed stressed paranoid paranoid one false move
I can be destroyed to avoid the cops I use a decoy
Stop talking bout drugs on the telephone
Stop walking with a bunch of thugs to my home
Stop telling these bitches where you got it from
The sheriff departments right down the block
Before I have to go to jail
Pass my beer so I can swallow this rock
Before somebody go snitch
I avoid the cops I use a decoy
I'm so paranoid stressed stressed paranoid paranoid
I avoid the cops I use a decoy
As I bail down the street with my khakis creased
Everybody looking at me look like the police
Asking questions giving suggestions
Hope the cops don't backup here they come man
The sheriff departments right down the block
Before I have to go to jail
Pass my beer so I can swallow this rock
Can I possibly get real
Before somebody go and snitch
Spend more time with my son and my daughter
But my drug life drug me away from my wife
She couldn't deal with the stress and the strife
But I gotta sell dope till it happen
That's what I'm saying now
You know the gonna snitch
They can't even lie to there parents
The sheriff departments right down the block
Before I have to got to jail
Before somebody go and snitch
Now god lay me down to sleep
Please give me a beat
If they accidentally kill me
Pray some white person
Straight in to the woods camera
If I don't sell a mill
This could could happen still
From the tracks of the ghetto
I make it then take it
To the mom and papa store
From the mom and papa store
Don't want no more rappers on consignment
Find another alignment
Come back another climate
People don't even know who you is
You need a name in the music biz
Your elbows and kneecaps have no lotion
Out the door is where they catch me
Straight into the street
Now I'm on my way to swap meet
In a fight with the white security guard
You can spend your money here
You can't make no money here
I go and drink a beer
I'm so depressed plus overstressed
Wanna rap so hard I'm obsessed
Sometimes I wanna cock my heat
Let me show the whole world what I'm all about
Let me show the whole world the best of me
It might sound strange in my rhyme
But I'm from the west coast
I can't change with the hands of time
What I am is what I am
If you don't like what I am I don't give a damn
I wanna kill every cop I meet
I wanna burn down this house that swapped me
Its time for the black folks to live it up
Runs from the black vigilante
Let me show these motherfuckers what I'm all about
Fuck the sheriff in the ass till he scream and shout
Let me show the whole world the best of me
Let me take control of my destiny
I make my own rap tape and tell it like it is
I had to walk 13 miles to school
Spend a lot of money on some brand new clothes
Full of alcohol at the football games
It would take a miracle for me to graduate
Got a golden eagle on my stolen Regal
On a rock cocaine scholarship
Cook that crack until it's done
I use that for my Negro college fund
But you told me you would never fuck a black dude
To eat a fat dick like sum soul food
Black people in college act stuck up
You can suck my dick just like that boy
We can slide your vaginal credit card
I don't want to work no more
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Got hired at the dope spot
Zigzags come free wit a bag of weed
The skinny black dude wit the real long perm
Getting money with my folks on a hundred spokes
Put a add in the paper in the classified section
Modern day slavery knocking on my front door
Can't see a way to control my own life
I don't want to work no more
Modern day slavery is knocking on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Steal ya car battery and sell it back to ya
Cause my garage looks just like auto zone
It's just like Vegas in my back yard
Can't see a way to control my own life
Can't see a way to control my damn life
Sell it on the corner and buy myself breakfast
Where the Mexicans and the blacks is mother fucker
Abraham Lincoln told me I was free
I don't want to work no more
Can't see a way to control my own life
Said I don't want to work no more
Can't see my kids can't see...
I don't want to work no more
Is knocking on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
U know what he said man he got smart wit me he said
I got a bag of weed and a bottle of wine. I'm a fuck that bitch just one more time.
Don't be amazed at the stories I tell ya. I met a woman in the heart of Australia.
I came in her mouth. It was a crisis. I gave her my secret blend of herbs and spices.
She won't let me fuck
I really need to bust a nut
She won't let me fuck
I really need to bust a nut
I really need to bust a nut
I'll give you my money
The wrong message I hope I'm not sending. Laughing and pretending my dick's not extending
Don't make me cry. Look into my eye
I'm so glad I'm glad that trouble don't last always
He used to grow his vegetables right there on the side of the house
And sometime he'd sing the same one like over and over and over again
It gets all in my hands
It gets all in my feet
It makes me wanna sing my song
To every little girl I meet
It gets all in my heart
It gets all in my sole
It comes straight out my mouth
And then I lose control
Damn how long is it gonna take you to roll a joint cuss
It puts ma mind at ease indulging ma self in the calm breeze
N ma problems will float away beyond the palm trees
N ma problems will blow away like a plastic bag
I gotta lie to the man
I gotta go to the clinic baby
I got no food for ma stomach
I gotta walk to the supermarket for some golden seed
Let's go to the club tonight. Find a woman that wanna make love tonight.
Hope I don't wreck when my vision gets blurry. Sober up looking at an all white jury.
Judge don't like no drunk like me. Punk might give me strike number three.
It's Friday night. Got the perfect weather. Let's get drunk together.
Let's go to the club tonight. Find a woman that wanna make love tonight.
Let's go to the club tonight. Find a woman that wanna make love tonight.
Let's go to the club tonight. Find a woman that wanna make love tonight.
Let's all get drunk tonight. I hope I don't fight with a punk tonight.
Let's all get high tonight. Maybe nobody will die tonight.
Let's all sell yell tonight. I hope I don't go back to jail tonight.
Love to sag my khakis with a tall can
We the loudest homeboys in my neighborhood
We look real bad but we feel so good
Always gotta bad attitude
You see I can't wait around till I get rich
I stepped into this party full of Mexicans
I didn't realize I was the only black man
I think she was embarrassed with the eight ball in my cup
I knew if I moved I was officially dead
Ain't the first time that I got confronted
Love to sag my khakis with a tall can
Now we the loudest homeboys in my neighborhood
We look real bad but we feel so good
Always gotta bad attitude
You see I can't wait around till I get rich
Now I got a new place to sell my crack. Now I got little white kids to jack.
I drunk whiskey and Bacardi. I sold dope to anybody.
I put a fat rock inside his hand. About 25 sheriffs jumped out the van.
Dead end job at the airport. Check too short to pay the house note.

Please take me back home To Mississippi
Please take me back home To Mississippi
I stayed in a place called Palmer's Crossing
Buy my rap tape tomorrow
Request my tape when you go inside
So I can take Jane and girl
Leave with their Auntie Sheryl
She sucks me sucks me
But I hops in the Coup
Pinch the nipples on her tit again
Suck my dick until she spit again
Please take me back home To Mississippi
Please take me back home To Mississippi
From the delta to the coast
Separate me from my bitch and shit
Officer Roscoe P. Coltrane
But I can't be no hip hop star
Cuffed in the back of some police car
Let's all get drunk tonight
I hope I don't fight with a punk tonight
Hope I don't crash when I hit Pedal
Get my ass kicked in the white ghetto
Prejudice police won't let me go
Got a phone call from Nikki and June
All these pretty women that I meet in Wiggins
I got my dick down some girl's throat
I can't help it It's a trip baby
I think you need to wipe your lip baby
The whole house ruler
Geri curl activator in my hair
I'm in control like Janet when I hit Jackson
Tell the whole world Mississippi's your home
Depend on me like my name was patches
With all the Hillbillies
Confederate flags tobacco in their mouth
I'll make your girlfriend holler and scream
Then cook me some cornbread and collard greens
Drinking everyday like I'm supposed to
I am the American Dream. Even though the government tried to experiment with me
But I'm still the American Dream.
Because I was considered a distraction to the educational process.
And I'm still the American Dream.
But I'm still the American Dream.
But I am still the American Dream.
And I am still the American Dream.
There's a lot of people out there who can identify with me.
But you are still the American Dream.
But you are still the American Dream.
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the Underground Category.
My mind has been delivered.
I'm sure another alcoholic will care
Take a little time out for yourself
Man shorty got more green than a Boston Gems
But those who was in the days when the teachers was on that pay
And prone to move coke at a amazing pace
Get that call out one more time
I can keep my eyelids open hope that exotic dancer answer
And blew me jumped up on my dick screaming man I love what she do to me
See my homeboy in black and shout you blocking traffic back up and
Park you know I got a big fat blunt to spark other homeboys start
Say you got high gentleman excuse it get drunk sag your pants if you
All alone do your dance
I love to smoke a blunt man
I love smoking weed all by myself
Don't have to pass it to no one else
Got so much weed I don't have to hunt
Once I'm high and I'm high no doubt
I grab my ashtray and put my cigar out
Once my high is gone with the wind
I grab my lighter then I flick then I again
Briefly take a chronic break
I'm high so I put my blunt down
Turn up my music and dance all around
I can't hear the phone
I can't hear the door
I didn't have enough to buy me a beer
It's better than beer
I don't have to go take a piss
I don't know how to roll
But the people I roll with
Know how to roll blunts like a pole
Light that blunt and get stupid stuff
If you are a little kid
Please don't do the things I did
Tis the season to suck a drunk driver
Digital scale to weigh and measure
High as hell with dark sunglasses
Flunking all my stupid ass classes
Drunk and high in real cold weather
Call up some friends and play this CD
Stop the engine keep your head inside
Dashing through these hos
On three wheels we go
Smoking weed while I watch
I know this holiday hooker
I think her name is Jan
She's got a layaway plan
My dick plugged up her mouth
Your leaves so green and sticky to me.
On the cover of High Times Magazine
Let Earth abhor this thing.
As anguish and woe he'll bring.
As anguish and woe he'll bring.
As anguish and woe he'll bring.
The cultists awestruck dumb.
The Great Old Ones Destroy
Replete with obscene joy.
Replete with obscene joy.
Replete with obscene joy.
And through our ghastly dreams
His twisting turning tentacles
Elicit from us maddened screams.
Nobody Knows My Name Lyrics
Sing that one more time
To make a long story short
I like the skinny girl
I like the college girl
I like the church girl
When they're beautiful
I'm the hungry hustler
I like the wrong girl
I like the right girl
I like the black girl
I like the white girl
I like the brown girl
I like the yellow girl
I like the ghetto girl
I even got a green girl
I like the country girl
Don't let me get high and
Get the munchies girl
I'm a have me a woman
A man I wrote this rap
About Little Red Riding Hood
When I was a little kid
We took a ride to my hood
And I rode her real good
Like Martin Luther King
I said boom bang pop pow
When you're on all fours
Like a horse on her hoof
The most precious commodity
My brain's like the ocean
But nothing is swimming
I wanna have sex with you
When we was little kids
My girl got two big lips
Taste like potato chips
My girl got two big boobs
My girl got two big hips
Just like two battleships
My girl got real long hair
Down to her underwear
My girl gotta slender waste
Let my beeper just beep
Cook crack sip yak stack cheese
Ghetto resident everyday get bent
With the 2 tall cans for 89 cent
Get money get fame get women get props
Walk slow around the corner then dash hall ass
Run up in the house shut the door goodnight
Come back out bout 20 minutes later
Ain't got no job ain't got no credit
But whatever you need I'll get it
But I'm in the ghetto
My problems won't let me go
Until I go get some dough
Made my first CD started slanging it
But I couldn't get rich on my side of town
Don't grab my keys when the party's over
I don't know what you've been told
Hop in my Cadillac and handle my biz
I drive better drunk than I do sober
I hope I'm not dead right
I'm a Colt 45 certified drunk
Became the world's greatest wino
Once I get into that zone
I leave that beer and that liquor alone
But I can glide that Cadillac like a hawk
I ran from the cops in the rain
With my church shoes on
Wasn't nobody out there but me and the sheriff department
Fell asleep on the 14
Fell asleep on the 405
Fell asleep on the 105
So we might have to drive
With your windows down
Long after the Sheriff Department is gone
Long after the Sheriff Department is gone
Long after the thrill of riches is gone
Long after the thrill of riches is gone
Universal loved Afro when he was on top
But Jesus would comfort Afro when he prayed
Long after corrupt record companies go bankrupt
Long after corrupt record companies go bankrupt
Make me feel all right
Through my neighborhood for some Colt 45
Flirt with the fine hoes
Crack jokes with the winos
I know where Colt 45 is at
In and out like that 20 seconds flat
I can get shot if I take too long
Right around the corner through the park
Start back selling my caviar
Rough expression on my face
Maybe it's because I like the buzz
Don't care who you is or who you was
Let all four my windows down
Getting handcuffed on a liquor store run
Pretty women everywhere
Brother can't help but stop and stare
If she do or don't reply
I still feel good that she walked by
Put it on repeat all night long
I got a new album with LA tour dates
Play two different instruments at the same time
Billy D. Williams is old
I got a new Billy D. Williams
Don't want nobody to worry me
Now cars and houses I may not own
But I'm a bad motherfucker on the microphone
Don't want nobody to worry me
The light turned green and I started to bail
Seen a fine girl at the red light
Her face her hair her car was tight
The light turned green and she had to go
She got out the car and walked around
She put her head down and tried to pass real fast
I asked her with Colt 45 on my breath
With a booty up against me make me feel real good
My dick Johnny Cochran gets real hard
That's when I whispered in her ear
Oriental girls not mention black
I'm 30 years old in 2004
I got a wife and I don't fuck around no more
And bitches wanna do me like I'm Kobe Bryant
Gotta do one song for the hood
This going out to all my homeboys
All my balling homeboys
It's lonely at the top
Late night crack house deep off in the hood
We kick it outside cause the weather feel good
Stereo bumping in the living room
Colt 45 got your boy on buzz
Talk to my man about some real deep shit
Pulling to the side and selling the rock
The block get slow about a quarter to four
They take the handcuffs off and we get released
Beating in my Caddy like cops in Cincinnati
Look at the liquor store and see my name on the wall
The light turn green and I starts to bail
Drink Colt 45 in the ghetto
Struggle and strive to get out the ghetto
But the ghetto is inside me
A low rider with some colt 45 in my cup
I was on my way to college and then saw
It was nineteen hundred and eighty three
I knew exactly what the Fuck I wanted to be
A low rider bass provider drop down like a spider
Spy the hood rat and go straight inside her
Bitch can't ride in my Cutlass
My daddy wanted me to take the Dayton's off the Dodge
I took from the ghetto what I could take
Messing up a new car for no reason at all
Front and back Homeboy front and back
Can't stop driving them gangster cars
New cars just don't appeal to me
I used to be local but now I'm Worldwide
Smash out fast then dump her
Sparks straight flying from the bumper
Hit that switch don't be no buster
Hop in the coupe like a toad frog
Go swoop up your role dog
Go way back like heyday
So they'd be hungry for the apple that the snake was always offering
He made it earth our home.
But everybody sag in the hood
But these wranglers too dam tight
But them wranglers is too dam tight
I don't know but he from the west
Remember them old school rappers right
Didn't fit in with the preppy prep
But now they smoke weed and wear baggy clothes
I got to bed and sag my pajama
Sag in the airport fool
Sag when I out the county jail
Sag when I hop out the super sport
I bet ya my pants don't fall
The more you drink the better I sound
Go to the bar and buy another round I feel wonderful
How many people feel wonderful tonight
She unfastens her bra strap
She slides off her underwear
Reflects on her pubic hair
Then slowly slide my tongue inside
You taste wonderful tonight
She sucks on my dick head
She gradually licks my balls
She tickles my asshole
Cause this girl can do it all
I slowly lost my eyesight
You suck wonderful tonight
I'm not a handicap but I like to limp
Lean to the side and grab my meat
Always hang around old fools
Lean to the side as I stride
I can't hide my hustler pride
When I walk that walk and talk that talk
Some boys in the hood taught me how to stroll
I did it wrong and I did it right
I used to practice in my room
The very next day I walked to school
The sheriff hit the block
Turned the spotlight on
With my dick in my hand
And the cool ass way he talk and jive
Even when he get locked up in jail
He hop out his cell and begin to bail
All the homeboys locked in the pen
Limp down the hall for me once again
Colt 45 in my glass...
Hit The Corner on three wheel.
Those are my Caddies up against the curb.
I dun been to jail for a lot of stupid shit
Down on my luck couldn't fine no job
I know I can't do it forever
Two cops ran pass my window
I flushed two ounces in the bathroom
Before they could find me
Yeah man they went through my back yard
Hopped over the fence... anyway
You know what I hate though
Treat customers like compulsive liars
Raise they shirt and check for wires
Some guy in a shirt and tie
Is it homicide or FBI
They think I don't see em
Street clothes with that little wire in they ear
Universal Records year man
No more paranoia hey hey
I have no more paranoia
Let's get drunk today
Let's get high tonight
Things will be alright
Sometimes I stop and wonder
Let's get drunk today
Let's get high tonight
Things will be alright
Sometimes I stop and wonder
Bumping my music very loud
Limping down the sidewalk so high
Let's get drunk today
Let's get high tonight
Things will be alright
Sometimes I stop and wonder
Now I'm nice and tipsy
Flirting with the ladies
Let's get drunk today
Let's get high tonight
Things will be alright
Sometimes I stop and wonder
Taking laps around the hood
Hope I get sum pussy while I'm drunk and high
Drink till my eyes turn burgundy
When I was young we wanted to get out the ghetto
But after we moved out of the ghetto
It was hard to get things we needed
I took a picture in the hood
White T shirt and black khakis
I see the corner that I worked
Looking for some crack
I don't need to be the king of the world
All I need is some activator
Compton isn't too far away
Neither is South Central LA
No matter what the cops try and say
We move from South Central
To the desert of the real high
When I come home late at night
The sheriff harasses me
He puts me in the choke hold
So bad I can barely breath
Compton isn't too far away
Neither is South Central LA
No matter what the cops try and say
I'm thinking oh my god
I got nowhere else to go
My hands are in the air
I don't know what to do
Not right now man dad kinda busy
Where you get some beats from
I mixed it down and burnt it to a CD here ya go... by the way man that's a cheap CD burner
Hey dad why don't you and me have a freestyle session you and me right now
Dad... my and my dad we rap so tight every word we say it sounds so right
I just passed the test
Cause all of the sudden you gonna get picked
When you walk over their and cheer him up all of the sudden he got pride in his cup
Then you share with him and you share with he man that's the ultimate
Don't grab my keys when the party's over
I don't know what you've been told
Hop in my Cadillac and handle my biz
I drive better drunk than I do sober
I hope I'm not dead right
I'm a Colt 45 certified drunk
Became the world's greatest wino
Once I get into that zone
I leave that beer and that liquor alone
But I can glide that Cadillac like a hawk
I ran from the cops in the rain
With my church shoes on
Wasn't nobody out there but me and the sheriff department
Fell asleep on the 14
Fell asleep on the 405
Fell asleep on the 105
So we might have to drive
With your windows down
Before I have to go to jail
Before somebody go and snitch
I'm so paranoid stressed stressed paranoid paranoid
I avoid the cops I use a decoy
I'm so paranoid stressed stressed paranoid paranoid one false move
I can be destroyed to avoid the cops I use a decoy
Stop talking bout drugs on the telephone
Stop walking with a bunch of thugs to my home
Stop telling these bitches where you got it from
The sheriff departments right down the block
Before I have to go to jail
Pass my beer so I can swallow this rock
Before somebody go snitch
I avoid the cops I use a decoy
I'm so paranoid stressed stressed paranoid paranoid
I avoid the cops I use a decoy
As I bail down the street with my khakis creased
Everybody looking at me look like the police
Asking questions giving suggestions
Hope the cops don't backup here they come man
The sheriff departments right down the block
Before I have to go to jail
Pass my beer so I can swallow this rock
Can I possibly get real
Before somebody go and snitch
Spend more time with my son and my daughter
But my drug life drug me away from my wife
She couldn't deal with the stress and the strife
But I gotta sell dope till it happen
That's what I'm saying now
You know the gonna snitch
They can't even lie to there parents
The sheriff departments right down the block
Before I have to got to jail
Before somebody go and snitch
Now god lay me down to sleep
Please give me a beat
If they accidentally kill me
Pray some white person
Straight in to the woods camera
If I don't sell a mill
This could could happen still
Cut my hair is what y'all said
But I couldn't get a job with a bald head
To escape modern day slavery.
This next song is dedicated to all whack rappers
And all the whack people who like and buy their whack music
Don't change clothes change the CD
Murphy Lee what the hook gonna be
Cause you do need a hook and another beat
Laugh when the motherfucker falls
These fools can't rap at all
When they beat come on
I hope it go off soon
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
Both of these rappers are whack
And trying to play it off like they doing their thing
How can you be from a city so black
I got a milkshake for you and its tasty
No body plays an instrument man
They can stop putting all that bullshit out
What a girl want what a girl need
That is all I wanna do
That's my song that's what I wrote down on the piece of paper
Call up Puff Daddy ask him if he wants to do a verse with me
Real pimps get down on the flow
But I don't see a hoe in the video
What happened to the bitches man
Its supposed to be about Cadillacs
Even though it's all good
It might get misunderstood
Her CD ain't worth it
Put you money in your pocket and reverse it
Her CD ain't worth it
Put you money in your pocket and reverse it
Missy Elliot makes a bunch of bullshit
Missy Elliot makes a bunch of bullshit
Missy Elliot makes a bunch of bullshit
Missy Elliot makes a bunch of bullshit
Missy Elliot makes a bunch of bullshit
I can't stand her music going in my ear
If you like Missy Elliot get the fuck out of here
I can't stand her music going in my ear
If you like Missy Elliot get the fuck out of here
Most rappers are whack just like the people they attract
Most rappers are whack just like the people they attract
Most rappers are whack just like the people they attract
Most rappers are whack just like the people they attract
Most peoples head is round
If her attitude wasn't so shitty
She ain't got no back door
In my radio you gets no play not today
What the fuck happened to MTV
Why these whack people get to make a CD
I don't know man look at 50 Cent
He don't move his mouth when he rap man
He don't move his mouth
Ill teach you how to stunt
They need to let me teach them how to roll a fat blunt
Get high get drunk and take it easy
And stop making songs so cheesy
Now Manny Fresh is actually fresh
But the worst rapper I ever heard man
My name is Silk and ill shock you
All the fellas roll a fat blunt and
All the ladies rub on your cunt and
Because I got high in this bitch
You can't see my burgundy eye in this bitch
You need to give beer and marijuana a try
I ride thirteens and hit the three will switch
Hungry Hustler records with the marijuana leaf
Now I'm about to smoke some green
Real women groping me
Cheater haters scoping me
Cops know I got some liquor plus I got some dope on me
All the fellas roll a fat blunt and
All the ladies rub on your cunt and
Started slapping hoe bitch
Told that bitch to suck my dick till the fucking world ends
All them bitches bring me riches
Put them riches in my britches
Leave them bitches in some ditches
Everything a brother need
No stems no seeds roll it up with speed
So much weed my house look like a galley
All the fellas roll a fat blunt and
All the ladies rub on your cunt and
Everybody know the party don't stop
Pull it close to me rubber on the hip
Another day another party
Different place different pace
Different faces different races
Colt forty five is my sexy wife
My chipper collecting chunk
What you call a hooker with a runny nose... fool
Hey you like that shit
When I was a boy I couldn't find a girl
Now I got women all over the world
Like Naughty Nancy from North Carolina
She said kinda... she came
People heard her screaming in China
Big Jug June down in Peru
10 minutes later my dicks high point
June smoked it like a joint
Your daughters fucked
You caught her yelling
Doing the dime at the time
Licked my dick like a Jolly Rancher
Country singers from Nashville
Jumped in the van with the Dixie Chicks
Checked into motherfucking Motel 6
I flew Holly to Hollywood
Grandma Biggie from Ventura
Took off her clothes left on the shoes
Bent her over stuffed her stocking
Suck my dick all the way to Frisco
Tried to fuck a girl from France now
Unzipped ma pants pulled out ma wood
I be damned she is a woman
She took off her pants and put on a dress
I don't gamble but I played her slot
Gave her two daughters and two sons
Had a massive ass with two massive tits
A facial facial until her sight was blurry
I fucked veronica from Vermont
I meet different people in the streets
Rappers where assholes to me
I don't wanna be like the bad rapper
I wanna be the good rap the love for the hood rap
So I listen to the circumstances
And if I can I give people chances
Nobody gave shit to me but should I be like them
No I shouldn't so I should help people out if I could
Don't wanna crawl before he walks
I don't wanna come off like a jerk
But everybody in the world has to work
I make money off everything like a flat broke crack smoke human being
You say you gonna sue me but the letter hasn't came yet
You won't teach me a painful lesson I'm teach you one
You made a song calling me a bitch nigger
But I'm a pimp and your beats made me rich nigger
You say I'm washed up but you never washed in
I bet you wash everybody's drawers in the pen
Fuck all this drama you got your ass kicked by your baby momma
You know bitches get in line but they get checked you know what I'm saying
You know Grass grow gotta cut you know what I'm saying
And pretty soon you gotta cut it again you know
Took a ride to the sunny side to the money and ride fro daddy that's right
Fucking her friend in State College.
She's from Penn State
Getting licked by a girl in Lancaster.
Betty with the Gettysburg Address
I raised her dress and left a mess
Just up in the city of brotherly love.
You know I like Randall Cunningham
Roll me a Philly for the city of Philly
We used to be boys but we turned them in with the munchies
Signing the declaration of independence from our dependence.
While I fucked the receptionist Laurie
Afro is the tightest and that's for real
I met a new girl in New Castle
In the wintertime she's still wet
Stop out the shower on a thick white cloth
To keep the girls on my dick
My sight get blurry and my edge spin
Filled up all her semen holes.
Her pussy got hotter than a boiler maker.
Fucked up Christmas like Mr. Scrooge.
Rode that ass just like a Lexus.
Fucked her again in ft. worth
Stuck my dick in her pussy and I started to surf.
I priced this hooker in Ohio
Fucked her in the back of my 83 Caddy
Beer and munchies got me gaining weight.
I got a bag of weed and a bottle of wine. I'm a fuck that bitch just one more time.
Don't be amazed at the stories I tell ya. I met a woman in the heart of Australia.
I came in her mouth. It was a crisis. I gave her my secret blend of herbs and spices.
Four hundred twenty pounds of weed
Four hundred twenty pounds of weed
Four hundred twenty pounds of weed
Just move from side to side
I can't sleep at night
Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight
But when the night's over and it's daylight
Scratched up knee caps and elbows
But they still together and that's how it goes
This is a story of Jack and Jill
I mean a couple lovers that live next door
I can't sleep at night
Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight
But when the night's over and it's daylight
Scratched up knee caps and elbows
But they still together and that's how it goes
Reverend Green thought he called one day
But just as the pastor knocked on the door
A right connected and he hit the floor
My other neighbor tried to intervention
But one jab knocked out his good intentions
I can't sleep at night
Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight
But when the nights over and it's daylight
Scratched up knee caps and elbows
But they still together and that's how it goes
A lion escaped from a circus train
They got in a towering rage
The lion took a look and jumped back in the cage
I can't sleep at night
Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight
But when the night's over and it's daylight
Scratched up knee caps and elbows
But they still together and that's how it goes
One day a reporter interviewed the wife
She said that she never had time for books
Too bad he couldn't stop that right to the jaw
I can't sleep at night
Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight
But when the nights over and it's daylight
Scratched up knee caps and elbows
But they still together and that's how it goes
Her language I did not understand
She said it was the best in all the land
I said no thank you please it makes me cough and sneeze
Than he pulled out a ten pound bag of cocaine
He said it was the best in all the land
I said no thank you please it makes me cough and sneeze
Than he pulled out some moonshine whiskey
I said no thank you please it makes me cough and sneeze
I said no thank you please it makes me cough and sneeze
I said no thank you please it makes me cough and sneeze
I said no thank you please it makes me cough and sneeze
I don't want to work no more
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Got hired at the dope spot
Zigzags come free with a bag of weed
The skinny black dude with the real long perm
Getting money with my folks on a hundred spokes
Put a add in the paper in the classified section
Modern day slavery knocking on my front door
Can't see a way to control my own life
Can't see a way to control my damn life motherfucker
I don't want to work no more
Modern day slavery is knocking on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Steal ya car battery and sell it back to ya
Cause my garage looks just like auto zone
It's just like Vegas in my back yard
Can't see a way to control my own life
Can't see a way to control my damn life
Sell it on the corner and buy myself breakfast
Where the Mexicans and the blacks is mother fucker
Abraham Lincoln told me I was free
I don't want to work no more
Can't see a way to control my own life
Said I don't want to work no more
Can't see my kids can't see...
I don't want to work no more
Is knocking on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
And in the end my life will send for you to be with me
In the night I will pray god I wish my love would stay
I'm staring at the moon playing with the spoon that sits on the table
My tea is getting cold while I am getting old
I pray for the moon light to send me well wishes
Coming from over the hill and bring me my true love
I hope we will be together
Through history and beyond
If it's not you then I shall not be happy
I don't feel my peace nor the content
I think my love for you has been bent it's not what has been sent to me
Now I shall leave this little world and be...
Ironically... I care about everything
Glaucoma getting better and I know why
I'm playing basketball and jogging and I know why
My hangover's over and I know why
No more prescription pills and I know why
Now the state can fund drug treatment and I know why
No more criminal traps if it's legalized
Looking all around I know it now
Look at it when you shake your ass
Love it when I touch your neck
Made me feel like that
I start to fall in love
Hey beauty take your chance

Don't waste you're time

We are a donation of our civilization
This is kind of a demonstration

If we won't help our communication
So hide your hate and spread the love
And fight for fate that's written above
When you'll have time to open your mind
Your life's in your hands you can't walk it over

To make it finally fall and we will help you
And even if the whole world's
Believe in brand new day

The evil seed is spreading out now
Unite to make it stop

You and I baby ain't nothing but friends
And I know we gotta stay that way

But I can see this weird look in your eyes
Wanna give you some flowers

You and me we can switch
And I can play with your flower
Walk with me I'll treat you right
Give me your hand keep that smile on your face for all night
Cause it lightens your eyes
And when you look at me I already know that you know it to

Wanna give you some flowers

If you'd like sometimes
You and me we can be one night lovers
I can show you my tower

I've tried really hard for so long long
I won't write such songs no more
She's the one who I care about and she's worth it
She's got the key to my heart and soul
Since I remember we've been together sharing hope
There's something wrong with her
I've tried really hard for so long long
I won't write such songs no more
She came to me one day
Shining precious bird of prey
She kept messing with my head
You will have it all if you just follow my lead now
So I did and now I'm high
But I see my baby cry
We were together like the birds in the sky
Holden hands haven't thought for a whole life
I never did confess it to world
And how would like to have all around
Every day and every night
And all I have is my memories floating
And I don't wanna pain cause one way
And now I will confess it to world
That I would like to have it all around
Every day and every night
If you were the answer
I would never deceive you
I don't want to be trusting
If you'll be my girl and I will be your man
All my knees in the attic
But on the stop I must have it
Every day and every night
Go head you got it mama dis rite here yo time to shine
She keep her hair fix she keep her nails done
Now bring it down bring it down
I see she shake it plenty plush she a money maker
You do dis one for ya boy shake yo salt shaker
Now get low get low get low get low
Now get low get low get low get low
Now get low get low get low get low
Now get low get low get low get low
Across fallen lands and seems
For the infinity of time
With the reflex with god
Ref Fight is your time
When they stand to face your fade
It's the hero helping out
Find that hero in your heart
Use your power that you got inside
You're not alone in a better field
You rocking mind you'll bring me high
Ref Fight is your time
I'm cause your lipstick
I can use my vis quick
But that's win I'll never miss it
I feel I run it in rush
I grew up on the New York crime side
Everything got shut down when your boy touched down
You can die real quick out here
I can go back to the hood when I leave the booth
And this is the fact why it's tatted on my arm
Even in the Chi boy I be in the zone
Come home from prison time and do this music again
Listen man I know what you want
Bring all the jump offs from the hood that you cool with
All I gotta do is smoke her out and let her sip the passion
That's the only thing I know
Pull out the switchblade on you and I'm ready to rip you
When you hear the desert E sound you know what it is
You can have on a bulletproof and still crack your ribs
Load and fill up the clips
That's just what I sold though
Yo the don is just lethal
Through the eyes of the people
The hottest shit up on the CD or up under the needles
Happy Valentine's Day to all the ladies out there
Put the physical aside and I'll get inside your mental
Find another player to go and try to entertain your games
No time to go back and see what the real was
A good girl's hard to find with an intelligent mind
So let me know boo if you ready to shine
The way your hips move got me under a spell
Pretend they're not here just do what you do
A sweet touch comes handy man
Don't be afraid of the candy man
Pretend they're not here just do what you do
I've got stamina stamina
I know I'm not an amateur amateur
All about peace till I release the beast
And turn into another character.
I'm ready to take of.
My hearts locked and you've got the key
Base drop down hit in the bullseye.
I'll give it to ya all night long.
I turned around and gave it to her all night long.
And you can have all of me tonight
Ain't nobody else gonna make it right
You got me like a bullet taking flight
And you can have all of me tonight
Ain't nobody else gonna make it right
You got me like a bullet taking flight
I'll hit you right just like you like
If you can take the heat come and step into my kitchen
Tell me how you like it
Tell me how you want it
I'm prepared to give it to you
I don't even have to front row
How do you want it served
If you want the main course
How many drinks before you're with me baby
And you can have all of me tonight
Ain't nobody else gonna make it right
You got me like a bullet taking flight
You got me wanting more
Got me wanting to give it to ya
Be my baby you put others to shame
The way you bite on my lips
And start screaming my name
I sit and count the minutes till your coming to get me
And you can have all of me tonight
Ain't nobody else gonna make it right
You got me like a bullet taking flight
And you can have all of me tonight
Ain't nobody else gonna make it right
You got me like a bullet taking flight
The voices in my head try
The voices in my head feed
Don't you know they got a
Foot for you They got me
Chained in this room I'm
Stuck for eternity to
The voices in my head
Torture me tell wreck
The voices in my head
Beat me tell I go to bed
And I can take no more
Of this pain wont you please
The voices that I met
I just can't go to bed
The voices in my head
Torture me so I can't rest
The voices in my head
Beat me tell I go to bed
I'm stuck in the stuck
Give me something that
The work of the mysteries
Will be right for you
It's the nations I run too
Just give it a little
Of everything I know that I can run to
I'm flying solo I'm running
There's no need to interrupt
I'm flying my own thing
I'm flying solo I'm running
There's no need to interrupt
I have something to say to you
I've never dream to be in
I can't believe I'm rolling solo
Emotions are feeling very ill right now
I hope this helps you to open up
To a new and brighter day
I hear the sounds of the
Birds swinging and sway
There's a new thereafter
I found you in need of
The sun arise shining on
In the world today I'm passing home
The sun arise shining on
In the world today I'm passing home
Try your mentalist touch
So I went into the closet and got my gear straight
Twelve thirty at night I'm at a street light and hot
Fired through my back window broke the glass then hit dash metal
No time to look both ways I hit the gas pedal
Opened my eyes for surprising more
All out of breath and could hardly speak
I guess they heard I had a record deal
Well we talked and laughed about a half hour then
The finest girl I'd ever seen her name was Tina
Dressed all in red then my mouth said
And I asked her if she wanted to freak
Might even lick the cat but if I do I get to keep it
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it so
Then he get mad and wanna scrap
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Supersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
That's where I stayed and figured a way out
I gave it all I had so for what it's worth
Then go hang out like a link
I'm the brink of the blow up
Sink and watch me go up
As the treble tunes up
Now what you wanna do
So we'll fight to the finish
But I don't need spinach for me to do this
Cleverest shit around
But don't ever let us get you down
Funk that shakes the ground
But don't ever let us get you down
Assistance they get dragged the distance in a bag
But don't ever let us get you down
One two for the money
And got more soul than a ghost I have mostly EVERYBODY UP
I saw a Puerto Rican freak who was all that
Can I party if it's essential and necessary
It's the return of the incredible man
Who stands firm and rips up fakes without a cape
I had to get a tetanus shot cause fools bit but
And that's not long because I got a new song to sing
I'm fast on the feel so pass the pill
Ahmad I flip and rip kids and crews to shreds
I guess all should say yes y'all cause here I am
Everybody in the ghetto tell me...
If I'm gonna be considered as a gee
And you ain't gotta shoot
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
I'm the incredible man with the gift of gab
So if you don't want the funk then you a punk
Everybody out of they chairs should go for theirs
And if you can find anyone better or as bad as mine
Let's put the boom back in it to show the Joneses can win it
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
Word now everybody get up then sit back down and yell
Cruise and never lose in fights
Because I write and flip scripts
Now peep what I brought and maybe I even got
Your head like this or like that I can rap with anyone
You better yell if you want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
Imprinted through a rhyme I invented
Everybody get ready then set go
And when I let go of the microphone get your jam on
Please get off your rump and scream if you want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk
Bout to tell y'all about the Palladium
Well I said guess I guess
I'd rather watch chicks
My homey Kay said let's go
At the Palladium... word
I seen night lights hit skulls and glove boxers
Havoc and mayhem both straight from the West coast
I just maintained and step in the vestibule
Be reminiscent of disses
So chill and let's groove at the Palladium Friday
Kick it yo I'm still cool at the Palladium show
But now it's two o'clock I'm ready to split
Just wanna climb inside a bladder like a ladder cut the chit chatter
At the Palladium... word
That's Ahmad and the Joneses
It was hard growing up with no pops
That's how I got soul
To reach ya through your speaker
My mother alone helped me to be me
Used to do it like this
But since she never let me join a gang
So for all her prayers at night under the church steeple
I guess that I appreciate
And it's okay to like Mike
To show you're pissed
That all black people are menaces and holler and cheer
Ordinary people make the world turn
I learned that if you work hard in life
Then it counts the way the balls bounce
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it so
Then he get mad and wanna scrap
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Supersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
That's where I stayed and figured a way out
I gave it all I had so for what it's worth
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it so
Then he get mad and wanna scrap
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Supersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
That's where I stayed and figured a way out
I gave it all I had so for what it's worth
I keep my pimp hand strong to keep hoes in line
And when me and Mike Jones roll OH BOY
Y'all don't want it with us
Y'all don't want it with us
I got big wheels like I shop at Toys R Us
It's a brand new dance and it's easy to do
Everybody do the hooker hooker
Rock your body from the east to the west
Now they point when they see us say
I'm the one that bounce yo girlfriend off my knee
Hooker for who you want
Hooker for who you want
Hooker for who you want
I told y'all it was over man
She want hooker hooker
And don't it feel good
And don't it feel good
And don't it feel good
And don't it feel good
And don't it feel good
And don't it feel good
And don't it feel good
And don't it feel good
And don't it feel good
I ain't the one to play baby he did to her
I ain't the one to get the kitty cat kitten smashed
You Drag quick to bare men huh
Yeah I told I did when I did it huh
Only two wit a GT no body guard
Not a wide body keep the chick body wide
Brought me everything brought my shoes I MEAN THAT
Keep the pretty mommies like ANGIE MARTINEZ
Let the cat get one more dance before I get in the pants
And that's right here
Look look look at shorty right there
You know Drag hit the pipe there
All I did was ask her she said Yeah
Any number you want to call you can REACH ME
I'm like an apartment you can LEASE ME
I leave you wit a question mark and you on your period
You awfully freaky boy
Ooh well I like it from the back boy
You awfully freaky boy
When you want me come get me I'll be easy daddy
Don't hold back got contact
Get Ruff and ready daddy
I can't wait got me ache
I don't even put it back I just put it right on the tip
Jump right on the hips
Then I throw my Hammer like Pumps and a Bump
Love how ya look to the dome to the dome
Listen it might sound STUPID
But the reason why this star and handsome cat keep ya pants on
Cause the sides to big
Look at shorty mean booty
And I love it when they through it in my face
In the night the groupie
But they still want to do me
Chick could have fooled me
You gonna come when I come back again
Well that's too tight
So the I flip her back over tear a back boner
A pity we gotta be in these streets
Sometimes can't even trust ya own girl
Gotta stand here and face my fears
Ain't gonna shed no more tears
In this ghetto prison and I'm always
People are acting crazy and I can't
Done balled off dope sacks
Fell off and came back
Split they wigs with lumberjacks
Beat they ass with baseball bats
Caged like an animal 23 hours a day
And turn state's evidence for the deal that he cut
And ain't no way out but bank robberies or the lottery
Watch him come when I shake my bum bum I'm bad I said
Me and my ladies put it down in the worst way
Hey and we know how to party
And you don't want no problems cause my girls got my back yeah
And we ain't worried about our hair
If you bought it it's yours
So put your drink down and get on the floor
Show him where you at okay
Show him where you at okay
What you say when I come around your way
And we like nice things
Ginseng for that ass if you tired of the swing
On my hips or the bounce of the dip just sit
And everything you want you can't get
Me and my girls hit the floor
Get the rhythm from the beat
Get the drinks from the bar
We got our hands in the air
All the females over here
Leave the dudes over there
It's the battle of the sexes
That's how we do it baby
All my friends say I be zoned out when we roll out
But that's when I miss you the most
And I tell you this if I be with another
It wont help me feel no better
Pick up your phone I would get to tell that I love you
When I look here baby
Till I get through to your mind
Then me without you is the fine
It should be destiny for us to have a child eventually
When the time was meant to be
Everybody love you when you met my family
At first I ain't even wanna get wit you
But you broke it down
Showed there was more to you
Now you see that I'm in love with you
Crazy is as crazy does
At the phone booth think I'm gonna have to go sock some more change
So now who's gonna hug and hold me
Calm me down when I start to flip
Put it on me till I get a twitch in my hip
Stay up and talk to me after it's over
Damn I feel like you took my heart with ya
Boy wish we could start all over
But I ain't ever wanna let you go
That I ain't ever wanna let you go
That's why I called you to let you know
Baby we can work it out
We got things to talk about
I'm reaching out for your love
And you're the one that I wanna
Married on the spot be the cherry on top
The rings of things he seen about him bring him out
From the first thing is like I seen no doubts that's why I played queen to the king of the house
Why cry when I got this fly guy
Got me on cloud 9 with his love inside
Teach dummies a listen
As I laid down for bid all onto oil down my head
And God forbid I forget the way I was raised
Yeah that's what she said
Respect is always do to the person ahead
I'm sorry for the times we had too scream and shout
I just never wanna see any harm come too yeah
I live my life so now its time for you
To do all the things I could not do
No matter what happens I'll be there for you
As long as you do it right
Girl you're beautiful
Despite all the problems you've been through
Know that you can make it through
If no one ever told you
And that's a small piece of the puzzle
So go and get your piece of the pie
Keep the Martin Luther King dream alive
Just never let them see you sweat
Try not to do the things you will regret
Now if you did it's the past
Just try not to do it again
Plus be careful when you're picking your friends
Be careful of the ones that pretend
Some one that'll stay to the end
Some one too depend on and lend
I can't be here forever
As long as you do it right
I remember them rainy days I had in my life
She was always there to make my days go bright
I'm always there for you
You're the sun in my day and the night you're my moon
No matter what it is you're going through
That's never ever never ever
You got served with the words from my pen and my pad
This lyrical overdose is hard digesting it
Now when ya brains hit pause and I kick down your doors
All I need in this world is somebody
So I know who gone be there when I need him
I'm gone make you cry
I don't care if you don't
As long as I can call him mine
I'd be still with him
He say he love me all the time
Sent for me to kiss me
His thug is repelling me
And he ain't never letting me drop
And it's plain to see
That's why I play queen to the king of the house
Ain't nobody true like the truest
He keeps skies blue and
Got me on Cloud Nine when his love inside
I had to give this thug a try
Shouldn't take up as soft
Wanna teach dummies a lesson
He don't give cop confessions
Top boss stove like Avon from the wire
Blue Range Rover 22 inch riders
Can spend sometime together
What you dunno I'm in beauty pageants
U like how mi frame shape kinda like Trina's
Turn it up turn it up when you hear mi sound
Got mi hands up yes congratulate her
Turn it up turn it up when you hear mi sound
Got mi hands up yes congratulate her
Listen up watch me close you can't stop these flows
Mi watch look like a rocky road
And I will take lead over all y'all dumb broads
I came to stay like 8 straight summers
Turn it up turn it up when you hear mi sound
Got mi hands up yes congratulate her
Turn it up turn it up when you hear mi sound
Got mi hands up yes congratulate her
But you know we keep it smooth
U can tell I'm a star by mi necklace
Benjamin Franklin cash no checks
Turn it up turn it up when you hear mi sound
Got mi hands up yes congratulate her
Turn it up turn it up when you hear mi sound
Got mi hands up yes congratulate her
Softly she whispers a slow melody
A moment ago she was dancing with me
Lady I'm falling so please don't go
All I need is a night with you
Softly she whispers a slow melody
A moment ago she was dancing with me
Lady I'm falling so please don't go
All I need is a night with you
I swear I'm not lying
Maybe tonight I'm gonna try my luck
I can see that you want me
I'm dreaming about you every night
Kylie give me just a chance
Let's go out and dance
We can get into the groove
Later you can sing to me
But I rather do you on the backseat of my car
Kylie give me just a chance
Let's go out and dance
We can get into the groove
Later you can sing to me
But I rather do you on the backseat of my car
Baby I'm the coolest guy in the crowd
I'm sure you have seen me
I'm dreaming about you every night
Kylie give me just a chance
Let's go out and dance
We can get into the groove
Later you can sing to me
You slowly drive me crazy
Can't get you out of my mind
I should be lucky to sleep with you tonight
Kylie give me just a chance
Let's go out and dance
We can get into the groove
Later you can sing to me
We in the truck with the windows all smoked up
So grown up you love ma style
I bet y'all sweat to this one
Bounce rock shake to this one
I guess y'all really don't know me
Cats on the phone like work it shorty
If you don't know then ask somebody
Ma glasses ain't cheap they...
Yeah go do it right there
Make everybody move to the rear
Eh shorty just roll with the she
You'll see me before you wanna be
And that why it's so cold
Quitting other cats they left in the road
Just picture us together over the centerfold
Bro I know the flows cold
Let me know that you feel it
And I know the roads slow but your ready to kill me
I don't really care unless it's paper or my family
Home's this is the roads and there's only one
Coventry... stand up Bradford... stand up...
Cardiff... stand up... London... stand up
Derby... stand up... Leicester... stand up...
Newcastle stand up... Sheffield... stand up...
Belfast... stand up... London... stand up
Don't learn when the shit happen
Burn when the clap em
Rappers act sick and I got the treatment
Similar to a Derringer
Add to that the fact that you're not real
You must be high as kites
Figure you can fuck with the nicest
That's why I've had more blows than opponents
Hoes don't know how I flow
If you've really had enough
And if your boss is talking shit
And you really wanna quit
Couldn't get close to me inside a phone box
Plus your whips and your clips is fiction
Legend like Christ and the 12 Apostles
Got more lines than Whitney's nostrils
If you've really had enough
And if your boss is talking shit
And you really wanna quit
But there's no Puffs in England
Get they advance and think they Trump
That's a Nova racing a Ferrari
Marcus Garvey or Muhammad Ali
My parables parachute here to Paraguay
It's paramount you don't fuck with I
Sicker than liquor in livers
But I'm bigger than that
If you've really had enough
And if your boss is talking shit
And you really wanna quit
It's like Shakespeare with a nigger twist
For lords on road and my hood ladies.
It's like Shakespeare with a nigger twist.
Another hearse roll up slow
Carry one more poor lost soul
Carry them things every single day
Talk tough look straight in his face
It's logical daddy got carried away
This Coward carried his son to this fate
His boys carrying weight in a wooden box
But look fate she don't wait
But her brain went insane on the day the
And really believe I have the strength to
And really believe I have the strength to
One more body bag getting carried back
From the war zone where they carry
They carry no fear of the man
All they know here is they land
So they roll cold with it in their hand
Let it bang on the big bad man
But this particular soldier never move
Never enrolled to blow no homes up
Felt that life had carried him under
Chose to phone the number
The army gives you training
Nothing they say could really explain it
Now you're a tool to carry their hatred
All he wanted was qualifications
So he could carry his family places
Better than those that he was raised in
Now who's gonna tell his kids daddy can't
And really believe I have the strength to
And really believe I have the strength to
The place where you find the coldest ballers you ever seen
But they locked up or dead not in the Premier league
Best kid that I knew turned fiend by 16
Years past tears start kids turn to teens
That sweet child you knew grill done turn mean
Get expelled and sell the world hell by 16
Fuck a couple pristine chicks that suck dick mean
Black tugs bust big slugs
The place where it don't matter if you never sold a shot
And dumb shit like we come from different places
London get ya shit smoked like a chalice
Black tugs bust big slugs
The place where you don't fuck with the Turks or the Asians
They said he'd be the next Ian Wright but
They rob the third world of every cent
Now you got third world debt
Then you pay tax on what you spend
Then you even gotta pay tax on your pension
They still wanna take your inheritance
Extending the congestion charge
Never fucking nowhere to park
Most of what you learn in class
Especially regarding the past
Men beating up on their spouse
Every single syllable that come out your mouth
Politicians talk never do shit
All of what they feed us in the news
Plus what they teach us in the schools
Politicians talk never do shit
All of what they feed us in the news
Plus what they teach us in the schools
Pull me over 5 times in a day
And I got attitude if I have something to say
They won't give firefighters a raise
Football fans monkey sounds
Black players that didn't speak out
White players that didn't speak out
Places where kids can't eat
Here you go fight for me
And I'll take the minerals please
Traffic wardens getting commission
Politicians talk never do shit
All of what they feed us in the news
Plus what they teach us in the schools
Politicians talk never do shit
All of what they feed us in the news
Plus what they teach us in the schools
Farrakhan banned from the country
Rapists come here and it's lovely
Pedophiles get light sentence
Ask yourself why they defend them
If they had weapons we would have kept stepping
Saddam would have bus it with no question
Pretty much every rap record
Look at what we do to our mothers
Politicians talk never do shit
All of what they feed us in the news
Plus what they teach us in the schools
Politicians talk never do shit
All of what they feed us in the news
Plus what they teach us in the schools
It's my time like it or not gotta ride can't fight
My mind spitting rhymes refined as old wines
No games since age 5 I hold mine
Never fell for the spells they tell in this world
I took exams early with the geeks in the school
Opened a business you were still chasing your balls
I spent my teens sticking but I'm one of Britain's best mathematicians
So however you want it kid we could do scholarship politics
You bleed like me and breathe the same air
I got a purpose on this earth
And I ain't ready to go
So if I gotta send you first then let it be so
It's time now the wait is over
It's time now the wait is over
It's bigger than the music
It's more like a movement
A unit a trueness spreading like rumors
I'm going from local to global
From gluing back shoes
To owning shoe companies and yards on the coastal
Fakes can't stop my flight
Not your life that's like
Trying to fight atomic war with a knife
Fight like mike with control not physically
If ignorance is bliss that explain my misery
Compete with me you get whitewashed like black history
It's time now the wait is over
It's time now the wait is over
Tings is crazy but that don't phase me
Tings is crazy but that don't phase me
Young soldier you can do whatever you want to
And no one out there can stop you
Not sure just watch me for practice
In these board meetings
Taking cheese off crackers
You actors are not factors
It does not mean that you're tough
It's the matrix and it's blatant you paper thugs are not ready yet
For getting unplugged
Grown man still talking like
Telling the world who you shot
And what are you earning
When you get popped that will not stop it from burning
Watch me grind you'll understand it as you get older
Nothing pretty but when I do things the job's over
Can I take you back for a minute
On the beat like streets cold as blizzards
Never lived with my father
Nasty break up with my mum and her partner
Moms did her best with the strength she could muster
But she so stressed it was us that would suffer
Play all kinda mind games to try break me
I went to bed in full clothing
Back when my world was closing in and mom was sick
I can't explain the pain when the news came
Sorta like the blizzard that came after the rain
Don't think I don't understand
But I still had to learn how to be a man
Funny how the cycle repeats
What don't kill you make you strong supposedly
That must be why nobody can hold me
When you think of all the millions barely living and hopeless
The deep end of the endless ocean of man's sin
Got technology and television
Still don't know why the worlds a weight on top of your shoulders
I was the kid in school with hand me downs from my sister
But the way I profile you would have thought I was Trump
Back when I was spotty and my head way outgrew my body
Before I bust my first nut behind the trees in the park
You'd find me and Jay drunk way after dark
Funny thing we all got ball in the morning
We like thirteen but grown as we see it
You find us any Saturday night in Coliseum
Sticking dick to big gal and I told her my age straight
Never been one to play games
Or watch face or none of that
Pop shots I'm gunning back
Look how these cowards running back
No matter what they say to you
No matter what they put you through
Always to yourself stay true
You gotta hold your head up high
When you feel you've hit the ground
And they seem to laugh out loud
Whatever goes up must come down
You gotta hold your head high
With aims to get paid and parade in the drop
Daddy left it seems the wind done blow colder
Mothers lose sons when them clouds disappear
Still felt like I had a right to fuck
Brought gal to my yard and the power would cut
With big bin liners still trying to look cool
Funny how you change the way you feel about the past
No matter what they say to you
No matter what they put you through
Always to yourself stay true
You gotta hold your head up high
When you feel you've hit the ground
And they seem to laugh out loud
Whatever goes up must come down
You gotta hold your head high
I know you're fed up but you gotta get up
I know you're fed up but you gotta get up
Spit what's real to me nothing more nothing less
Plus the only thing tough enough to break us is us
No matter what they say to you
No matter what they put you through
Always to yourself stay true
You gotta hold your head up high
When you feel you've hit the ground
And they seem to laugh out loud
Whatever goes up must come down
Till next week when a different face is another life wasted
Was soft like all children at 5 years old
And he wanna be next to push a range
But wait these streets ain't got no glory
Look at what we see and go through
Just know that my heart was good and that I tried
I just had too much pride
Big killers get big years and shed big tears
The guilt set in like a vice on the heart
And that's reality even though it's crazy
Everything is switched on still something don't work right
Do whatever you've got to do to make it through the night
So take your best shot with your best shooter
Everything is switched on still something don't work right
Do whatever you've got to do to make it through the night
Or become less guilty by passing the blame on
I'm the rapper that's dapper
No matter the chatter
From the land of sausage and batter
And the man are mad as a hatter
Do what ever you've got to do to make it through the night
Things are what they seem
Despite what they tell you
If you take a closer look and uncover the veil
You will see they're just salesmen with nothing to sell you
With these wags with their fags
Shag and they brag and pose for lads mags
It is sad we are sad for things we cannot have
But we are not sad for Baghdad
A rope tightens breath constricted
Sickness self diagnosed without witness
Wish list grip fist the beggary of riches
A belly full fights never willingly
An empty stomach does not have the energy to finish it
Layers in between padded by a dream
Stretching for the means
Without thought of exhausting the seams
No space for indignity on the face of simplicity
A taste of sufficiency's a belly full of lethargy
A dash of apathy a pinch of ecstasy's a recipe
Serving up a feast for the beast of our treachery
Not sure if your getting me celebrity's are effigy
I hear just fine but I'm deaf to those next to me
Conflict it perplexes me
Cause out biggest battle
Is now we're so free that we choose to be shackled
I'm stuck freedom lasso
This invisible strain of the human stain
Thus chained to another's pain
We may not be the artist by we surely are the frame
We may just be the smoke but we cannot blame the flame
Strange is the fruit that nourishes not the vein
Yet we are odder still for we seek it like the rain
Nothing bounds out path yet we march perfect in lane
Reality defies nature does not know surprise
Yet the lesion of our season blinds even the eagle's eyes
Spies dread not headlock tight as thread knot
This is not charity that is just sarcasm
That's why we bite so hard and never bark at em
It's play gather and prey
When even the mighty tiger
He desires to be tamed
I'm stuck freedom lasso
They act as if it's positive
Though it's so obviously derogative
And even if you're bobby
This is never your prerogative
It's obvious we're warriors
And crooked just like bobby is
But colleges and mockeries
Will never make a Socrates
Apologies and robberies
They follow with atrocity
Don't make very good crockery
And one day I will promise this
The day the tiger wakes
But I won't chase I was in a strange place then
You could be mine but I'm scared of the taking
And I'm not talking about consummating
All the time in the world is all we've got and there's no need for waiting
All the thoughts in my mind of what we could find got me anticipating
Right now we're just friends and I like how we're shaping
Plus I need time for the doubts that I'm facing
Look on my face you'll see that I'm gazing
And soon things got complicated
In fact no where near before
But I feel it from my afro to my big toe
It's not working and I need my space
Plus I gotta deal with this bullshit case
So we parted ways and it felt real strange
Didn't get much done with my days
I don't agree with myself even half the time
You can't succeed if you're afraid of failing
All the time in the world is all we have
And there's no need for racing
All the thoughts on my mind of what we could find got me anticipating
Right now we're best friends and I like how we're shaping
Plus I got over the doubts I was facing
Couldn't change time but time had me changing
All you little boys are a comedy of errors
You bellow but you fellows get played like
You're jealous like Othello.
All you little boys get Tamed like the Shrew
Your tunes aren't appealing
I am the Julius Caesar hear me
The Merchant Of Venice couldn't sell your CD
You're Merry Wives of Windsor not King Lear
I don't know about Timon
I know he was in Athens
When I come back like Hamlet you pay for your action
You're Much Ado About Nothing
All you do is bite it
Of course I'm the one with the force
You're history like Henry IV
That's suicide like Anthony and Cleopatra
She needed Two Gentlemen Of Verona
This is Illa State and I am the owner
Wise is the man that knows he's a fool
Tempt not a desperate man with a jewel
Why take from Peter to go pay Paul
Some rise by sin and by virtue fall
What have you made if you gain the whole world
But sell your own soul for the price of a pearl
The world is my oyster and I am starving
I want much more than a penny or a farthing
Poet or pauper which do you class him
That's surely irrelevant
I am the black Shakespearian
You still talk but it still perplexes me
Don't you know the king's name is a tower
You should never speak it
For certain I put daggers in a phrase
I'll put an end to your dancing days
No matter what you say it will never work
Where eagles don't perch
I'm the worst with th words
I'm the first with a verse to rehearse with a nurse
There's a hearse for the first jerk who turn berserk
I speak with daggers and the hammers
And I run more rings round things than Saturn
And they do shit to make us look heathen
Others judge us and snub us
We used to borrow sugar and some toilet paper
Embarrassing when it's my turn to knock
Know they say I'm conscious my words are positive
I'd rather tell the truth about what actually happened
Every bodies killing five hundred man in the booth
The roads are bad but
If as much man was dying in the streets as was dying in the booth
They'd be nobody left
Stop with dishonesty man
I'm ashamed and embarrassed to have to admit
Just a British nightmare with a similar theme
With the only difference being there's no opposites here
It is obvious we are not prospering here
Our grandparents came here invited by our majesty
Tragically just to be treated like savages
Here we are fifty years later nothings improved
We've gone back a step
Don't know where you come from
You don't no where your going
When your watching your TV
Learning your history book
It's just a bunch of lies that we perpetuate ourself
Being from the hood is not a definition of self
A million thugs in prison would die for my position
They get there so frequent for various reasons
When we're told we ain't shit we really believe it
It's covering the fear that they already no
You can only break a diamond with a piece of the same stone
So no matter where were at there's a diamond inside of us
That's exactly what it is just nonsense
They live in big nice houses
That's no hood iv ever been in
The hood I no everybody's trying to get out of
I'm a glutton for your blushing your sweet little nothing
Your discussion and your fussing and your face when your cussing
Even when your wrong and no one can tell you nothing
Man sexy but it's more than disgusting
Glutting for your stuffing n I want another clubbing
We talk a lot of shit but it don't mean nothing
I say that I'm fucking but you no that I'm bluffing
Listen for a minute baby let me tell you something
Let's take it slowly... bit by bit
Just get to know me... bit by bit
I know we're not perfect but... bit by bit
I know that we're worth it... bit by bit by bit
Take it slowly... bit by bit
Just get to know me... bit by bit
I know we're not perfect but... bit by bit
I know that we're worth it... bit by bit by bit
Every time that we sinning I feel that I'm really winning
When we finished and I'm grinning and I'm bringing another innings
We just fulfilling the mission we're reliving
I feel that I'm giving back myself that was missing
I'm more like I'm drilling to myself that was hidden
I'm a villain and I'm wicked but I'm also really timid
I'm rigid and I pivot but I'm careful not to fidget
The shirt comes down by your neck just a little
It ain't even hot but you sweating just a little
I feel like I might of found my wife just a little
Kinda like I understand life just a little
You wanna stay forever do my thing just a little
Let's take it slowly... bit by bit
Just get to know me... bit by bit
I know we're not perfect but... bit by bit
I know that we're worth it... bit by bit by bit
Take it slowly... bit by bit
Just get to know me... bit by bit
I know we're not perfect but... bit by bit
I know that we're worth it... bit by bit by bit
Be my lady... bit by bit
We can make babies... bit by bit
Drive each other crazy... bit by bit by bit by bit by bit by bit by bit
Be my lady... bit by bit
We can make babies... bit by bit
Drive each other crazy... bit by bit by bit by bit by bit by bit by bit
Let's take it slowly... bit by bit
Just get to know me... bit by bit
I know we're not perfect but... bit by bit
I know that we're worth it... bit by bit by bit
Take it slowly... bit by bit
Just get to know me... bit by bit
I know we're not perfect but... bit by bit
They wonder why the caged bird sings
But even worse a pain
Is the bird with lead wings
It's like I'm on my own town
But can't speak the language
Crowded to the point of suffocation
What bandage could heal scars invisible
Existing is easy it's living that is difficult
I get close to believing
Then I put a fortress up to close in my feelings
Then I throw it all away
Living every day in my shadow
When the cold night swallows that shadow
I travel through the landscape
But the question follows everywhere I go
You don't understand my soul
It's just something inside my head
It's just something inside my head
It's just something inside my head
I wasn't born this way
My condition was learned
Once bitten twice shy I don't wanna be burned
When you travel a passage
That leaves your soul ravaged
Your mind waxes placid to limit the damage
Your reaction is passive
Whether you like it or not
You cannot win whether you fight it or not
Your brain swallows the pain and buries it instead
It's just something that guides my
Something that drives my
Something inside my head
I offend myself then avenge myself
And pretend it helps to defend myself
I believe myself then deceive myself
To retrieve myself I don't need my help
Whether the brave myself or slave myself
It's strange every day I'm not the same myself
They say ignorance is bliss
Never a truer word spoke
Half the answers only bring more questions that we'll never know
Even the wise man knows he don't know much
Still not wise enough to accept it as such
So we chase the questions seeking direction
Every time we think we're right get a swift correction
Whether Muslim or Jew really don't matter which
You can't buy tomorrow no matter how rich
We all bleed and breathe and take shits
And chase the same answers
Though some think are better equipped
They still don't know
A theory is just a posh word for a guess
Because you're in a skyscraper don't make you different
From those in huts along the Amazon
And not more significant
We're all the same all rise all fall
But those on high horses have the furthest to fall
The moon and the stars
Or are we just entertainment
Chasing it all we rise and we fall
The moon and the stars
Or are we just entertainment
Chasing it all we rise and we fall
They say ignorance is bliss never believe it
Those who don't learn from history are condemned to repeat it
Or else you'll find yourself dancing to someone else's rhythm
Mental prison is the worst kind
You can take my liberty but my mind is mine
Smoking gun but they say they never shoot
No such thing as a fruit without root
Truth not being told will never make it go away
A lie told a thousand times can never take it's place
They're trying to hold so many destiny's in their hands
They're bound to drop a few
Everybody knows a rolling stone gathers no moss
The moon and the stars
Or are we just entertainment
Chasing it all we rise and we fall
The moon and the stars
Or are we just entertainment
Chasing it all we rise and we fall
All you gotta do is whatever that works for you
But when 6 billion individuals looking out for number 1
And we got to share the same sun
That's when the troubles come
That brings us back to where we started
That there are no answers
The moon and the stars
Or are we just entertainment
Chasing it all we rise and we fall
The moon and the stars
Or are we just entertainment
Chasing it all we rise and we fall
A little boy from North London
What you've heard for the last 40 minutes
It's bigger than your local colloquium
They're grown in tubes and inserted growth in them
But this ain't the type of pollution we place in the ocean
Don't matter who inhabits the bench
Is the one that says fuck you so nice
Reach your hand out you see you're in bondage
Conform and amputate conscience
Ever since days of the pyramids
Wrestle with things we can't manage
Like peace and equality
When you think about it it's quite funny
Can't inject it and kill disease money
But we pray at it all till we're guns and tanks
And offer the money god a million sacrificial lambs
Let us pray and hold hands
Not only do we believe that creed
We hold it deep and praise it as bravery
Along with the vision and difference
So we can maintain the belligerence
It's all just stages in a video game
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing my mind
I do believe our nature's kind
Just confused and we're so far gone
Got no clue how to right these wrongs
So we bury our head in the sand or the desk
Anywhere but inside of our flesh
I am not honest nor kind nor caring nor sharing
Or any of the many thing that I pretend to be
Follow truth only when it's convenient
Accept laws that I know that deceive me
So I can sleep in my bed easy
Look back through history
We would devour whoever the underclass were like cowards
Some say it's overspill from days when we were tribal
I don't buy that I think you will find that
That's an excuse if we just don't buy facts
Everything we really need to survive actually makes us feel good inside
So if war and hate were our natural causes
But I ain't gonna forfeit my privileges
We are the faceless people you don't ever see
We are the faceless people you don't wanna be
We are the faceless people you don't ever see
I need a little leg just to butter my bread
Gets a little bitter but I've gotta get fed
Never been a quitter so I've gotta get ahead
Nothing can change us
We come and we go but nobody knows
We are the faceless people you don't ever see
We are the faceless people you don't wanna be
We are the faceless people you don't ever see
We are the faceless people you don't wanna be
I need a little leg just to butter my bread
It's a little bitter but I've gotta get fed
And I've never been a quitter so I've gotta get ahead
I'm your worst teacher
Your favorite student
I'm the pretender but I speak trueness
Nothing can change us
We come and we go but nobody knows
Can't you see what is happening to us here
I'm gonna save it for another rainy day
I wanna raise these stakes in the game I play
But I can feel it all slipping out my way
Being the invisible man is not easy
Nothing can change us
We come and we go but nobody knows
And booty shake for me in a video
I don't need for you to be an independent woman
And laugh and talk and still like each other...
I don't need for you to wear red lipstick or lip gloss or face dust
I don't need for you to paint your nails
Or to add fake ones I think they look kinda silly.
I don't need to see your cleavage or your thighs
I'm still getting over your eyes and your smile
And I don't need any more distractions.
Or talk like this or walk like a supermodel.
I don't need you to lose weight.
I do need stimulating conversation
I do need to be able to be honest with you.
I'm finding that when you get to know a woman vertically
I can't be bothered to follow my dick around everywhere
I'm happy here and to be honest I just ain't got the energy.
And sometimes I feel inadequate.
Maybe I'm getting old but I just don't need it any more
By the sword they say
Just one more naked Vietnamese girl
Then we can have peace
They say I shouldn't say too much they might delete me
Realize I don't really care about TV
All I can do in this life is just be me
Young black rappers should utter the same words
Even the fact I call myself black
Social conditioning and that's a fact
The idea of races has no factual basis
It was made just to serve racists
To justify to doing to some what couldn't be done
Black or white all of our sons
Look up in the sky that's all of our Sun
Last time I checked we only had one
If that's not the case then nature has declared
Yours and my children
Yours and my children
Yours and my children
Yours and my children
Yours and my children
Yours and my children
And reap without sowing
Their backs still bent from the weight of our life
Look what I spent and gents it's half price
Don't matter that we don't pull it
If we don't care that's our breads buttered with the bullets
Our cars choke on blood
Limbs in our diamond tip rings go rotten
There's something we forgotten
Pillars of the temple may seem separate
But they support one roof
If your really checking it
All of our slaughters
Only our self in a war that we fought with
Kill a couple of us you're a devil
If you kill a couple million of them
Get stripes and medals
Generals conduct the great death symphony
Played in the key of hate
By musicians with no rhythm but offbeat killing
Hear the harmonies the screams of young women
They're not important
They are just orphans
They're not important
They are just orphans
How can that be if they're all of our daughters
Yours and my children
Yours and my children
Yours and my children
Yours and my children
Yours and my children
Yours and my children
If we decided to not be divided
Saw no one that we could side with
All the gun and stupid violence
All the fun of stupid tyrants
The blood of our defiance of the laws of natural science
Would have subsided or died a death or had no hiding left
Instead it provided the horse to ride on to the ride of death
We're enlightened but we don't know right from left
It's like we're blinded to the sight of death
For all our writing only writing on the doors of death
We're only fighting for the right to resort to theft
We would steal the air if we could as if we're short of breathe
Only if we're sure that it would have the cause and effect
Yours and my children
Yours and my children
Yours and my children
Yours and my children
Yours and my children
Yours and my children
Apparently I'm second generation black Caribbean
And half white Scottish whatever that means
It not that I've lost touch with the reality
Why must I rob you of your humanity
Eyes open wide but I'm blind to the sight
To educate is to draw out what is within
I got a heart like yours that pumps blood and oxygen
Lost in a fog of my own insecurities
And I judge everybody else
But it's not good for my health
For what we think strong is
Tired of everyday filling up my car
First time I saw knives penetrate flesh
As I grew and teenage years passed
Many more knives pierced and the shots blast
Maybe that is not quite literal
To my real fans I feel your pain
And I get the messages but don't complain
When was the last time you ever played Hendrix
If urban means street that means jazz to
Not discrediting love Zeppelin too
That blood socked word rappers still use
That was the word that the conscience eased
It's the whole world is human stupidity
I wake everyday and am overwhelmed
And the sheer weight of the thought of space
All that we chase and try to replace
The only way we can ever change anything
I doubt it's real really.
I organic on the mike and the flames I will fan it
To burn down the galaxy I'm up to the challenge
I am the war with New York to Paris
If for just one second you took your head from out your anus
You would see the motivation for your elevation
Close your eyes and don't believe that all you see is all you feel.
It'll rule your whole life if you let it
I don't believe that it's only every 6 seconds
Constant drones for those with testosterone
You know that a dog's gotta chase his bone
Got nothing to say unless it's around
I'm not sure if women know the things men do
Maybe you do and you're just the same too
But it's the only reason we go to the gym
And I'm not saying that women are to blame
We'd change very quickly
It's always on the brain.
All over the gaffe and you don't see one
How many homes you broke
All of the things that we will do
Is all we try to get with you
And all the nonsense that we say
In the hope that you will look our way
And when we stray we pay the price
But we take a chance and roll the dice
I know we only live our life based on what they think
If we didn't care for just one second
Realize your life is your's to live
Tell your friends or your parents and what they think
You want the whole thing
Four kids and a good job a big house and quiet down
If on the other hand you want to travel the world just to meditate
That's what you should do
You don't need permission from the state line commission
Just to be who you are
They want to write you off
They'll come around eventually
If not it wasn't meant to be
It's not that serious
Sometimes I want to fight
Sometimes I want to cry
But then I must remind myself
It's not that serious
We're gonna make it through
And find a better way
That works for me and you
If they were happy they wouldn't care
Problem is we hate to see another live the life that we dream
And I don't mean big screen and flashiness
Wake everyday excited what's to come
Never work a minute when doing something you love
It's never too late to get rid of the stress
There's a whole world out there
Just look up from your desk and say that the world is mine
It's not that serious
Sometimes I want to fight
Sometimes I want to cry
But then I must remind myself
It's not that serious
We're gonna make it through
And find a better way
That works for me and you
And I was for a long time
I'm not gonna lie and pretend I wasn't
Yeah I like to talk about the issues in the world
It's just not that serious
Do something crazy that people wouldn't expect you to do
Let's drop these things called egos on the floor
Just don't take yourself do god damn serious
By all means do something if you feel for a cause
But you can't feel poor enough
To enrich one single person on this planet
And you can't feel bad enough
To fill one single soul with happiness
People don't like what they see when they see you
It's just not that serious
It's not that serious
Sometimes I want to fight
Sometimes I want to cry
But then I must remind myself
It's not that serious
We're gonna make it through
And find a better way
That works for me and you
Today walk up to somebody and talk to them find out how their day was
When you don't want no one peering over your shoulder to read your letter
Stop taking yourself so god damned seriously
It's just your newspaper.
And there are probably a lot of people that are angry about that
And think I've gone crazy
I'm trying to make nice relaxing songs
I haven't got a problem
It's just that I stopped taking myself so goddamn seriously
Been through a little bit of tragedy
Yes I was around drugs and violence before the day that I started secondary
Also given the knowledge of self
That is all we actually need to survive
Teachers still treated me stupid
And the irony is some of the first man to give me schooling
Yeah I got a name and dough on the street
And that's the part that rappers don't speak
If we got the right guidance and love
I just don't boast about it songs
But listen to my older bars
I was just as confused as you probably are
One too many man you know get cut up
One too many man that could've been doctors
End up spending their whole life boxed up
It's all set out just to make them money
Is right in line with the dominant philosophy of our time
Comes back around you regain your mind
You be ready for the energy I channel in my rhymes
We can all fight with our brothers over crumbs
Far harder to fight the one who makes guns
We can all talk shit and get two dollars
Far harder to be the one who seeks knowledge
If we understood economics
All that you see me do I own
But I won't hang what I make around my neck
I know from where that the diamonds came
But I do quite literally own a library
That definitely costs more than your chain
Who need to know that you're not broke to listen
Don't know an asset from a liability
They've never been shown or told the difference
So they don't change situations
Richest man in Britain is Asian
Asian people build businesses
Giving out their culture for everyone's profit
As if racism just upped and vanished
Let me not just make sweeping statements
For small amounts of drug possession
There's more black people in jail in America
Than there is for rape and armed robbery and murder all put together
You can say they're just locking up thugs
Imagine if they locked up every middle class kid that had ever held drugs
Bigger than that what is going on with this
Prison in America's a private business
Also legally are allowed to use their prison inmates as slaves
So when we celebrate going to jail
We are literally celebrating enslavement
Engineered social condition that breeds crime by design
You can say that they're just black
But I like to deal with facts
But some people couldn't bear that the former slaves would not just lie down
So the KKK and other hate groups burnt those towns to the ground
If it ain't understood
Shit it's only been sixty years
Even gave kids the day off school
It's fun to watch the little monkeys die
Then people act a little dysfunctional
You wanna pretend that you don't know why
And you're powerless to get justice about it
And that ain't excuses
Just dealing with the roots of abuses that make a reality
Where a generation of young men speak of ourselves as dirt casually
Some things are similar
In this country the first enslaved were the working class
Who sends your kids to die in a war
They don't send the kids of the rich or politicians
That they send to go die in a foreign land
For these wars you don't understand
Yeah they say that you're British
And that lovely patriotism they feed ya
But in reality you have more in common with immigrants
Than with your leaders
Black and white are fed ghetto mentality
Reality in this system
Poor people are dirt regardless of shade
Let's not pretend that everything is the same
When our grandparents came here to Britain
If you had a criminal record you couldn't get in
Many times fired bombed our houses
And of course the cops did so much about it
But of course that has had no effect on why today we are crazy
And none of this was for any good reason
They were just dark and breathing
To ease the guilt now for all of this treatment
Constant stereotypes are needed
That mean when your kids go jail people make money off it
So keep environments that breed crime
Build more jails at the same time
Market badness to the kids in the rhymes
That it's because they're soft
But they want us to think that the road is cool
Being on road is all we can do
We don't control the wholesale productions
Or thinking there's no way out of road life
But Malcolm X used to hustle out on the roadside
One of my homeboys did a ten straight in the box in yard
Round the remains of an ancient town
That's 400 square miles around
400 square miles around
Too busy watching MTV
And MTV said wear platinum
Now everybody wanna go and wear platinum
And MTV said pop magnums
Now everybody wanna go and pop magnums
If MTV said drink prune juice
You would start hearing that in tunes soon
Oh and I drive a Mercedes by the way
So everybody listen to what I got to say
Ah but shit my head's still nappy
All of this here's good for the rhymes
Put us in the same place at the same time
And it's clear to everybody that I'm out of my mind
Clear to everybody that has got ears
I'm the guy that they just might fear
They wanna get near but they can't have a peer
Ah dear I'm hard liquor you're just like beer
Front on the kid for another five years
Come to my shows and some cry tears
I don't speak for myself but a unit
You could never ever be with a level on
Our songs get out played out there in Lebanon
We speak for the people properly
Not for the old fat guys in offices
He can't even be bothered to comb his hair
Back to the more important task of being so shower
And I ain't saying that will change rap
But I do know this for a fact
With his hand on his cock and his face screwed up
That he won't let nobody call his bluff
Because once that's happened there's no going back
Once you start to see what is really happening
Don't let them say what you can achieve
One of the first things they do is stop them reading
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
But absolute powerlessness does the same
It's the inequality that we live with everyday that will turn us insane
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
But absolute powerlessness does the same
It's the inequality that we live with everyday that will turn us insane
But as far as Britain goes shit I practically starved
The strain and the pain of just paying bills
And it is part of who I am
You wanna know the rage I feel in my stomach
Knowing my mum and dad split up when I was still in her stomach
And not everything that happened I will put in sixteens
But I will tell you enough so you will know what I mean
My boy's mother got cancer the same time as mine
The shit was fucked back then
When I was like ten already had the mental strength
More than many grown men
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
But absolute powerlessness does the same
It's the inequality that we live with everyday that will turn us insane
Being poor and alone just couldn't cope with the stress
And I earn my big sis for
I was thirteen by now
That is the result of no food in the fridge
And every other day being searched by the pigs
Fuck these patronizing teachers
And I don't mean a woman please lemme be clear
Than a working class black male with a brain
This is the potential that is wasted on a daily basis
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
But absolute powerlessness does the same
It's the inequality that we live with everyday that will turn us insane
I understand why it scares you
It's like how dare you
Overcome obstacles that we have been careful to
Place in your way every step of the way
In this so called democracy where kids get sprayed
And who's more confused than the poor white trash
Spouting the bullshit about they want their country back
What they did to brown people they did to their own poor
Black and Asian kids cussing eastern Europeans
I fail to see how this is an effective system
Cats and dogs in America and Britain
Eat better food then most of humanity
How is this more than sophisticated savagery
Each person's just an actor with a part to play
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
But absolute powerlessness does the same
It's the inequality that we live with everyday that will turn us insane
Go to Glastonbury any year
It won't be crawling with police
Had a very different life experience than me
In my experience they can't help but be smug
They're still more anxious
They will grow up though and get better jobs
They will maintain the system they claim that they hated
But they can't burn it down they got a stake in this matrix
And yeah they might backpack in South America
Or even volunteer in an African village
And shit hits the fan they're middle class and British
So more concerned with they cars and jewels
Most of the worlds poor looks just like you
Most of the worlds poor looks just like you
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
But absolute powerlessness does the same
Or just pack the jails
So please ask yourself
Been dark since the march of the Spartans
Before Eve ate the fruit of the garden
I was in pursuit of the truth like a slalom
Dodging these sergeants
The shackles are not tackled
They're just different
Cattle rattle and rattle
But they collect the dividends
We're a fuel for someone else's engine
We don't run a damn thing We're just pretending
My elders lick banks So you can't impress me
That we use to kill each other for fun
When the master sends the overseers to see us
We toss the weapon and run
Dashing her knickers all out of the cupboard
Got us face down with their feet on our neck
But we still believe we are vets
But... do we make the straps and the scales
Or just pack the jails
So please ask yourself
Do we make the planes and the boats
So please ask yourself
We blow each other's brain in
They drop bombs of depleted Uranium
What is that but state to state armed robbery
Just a road move on a bigger level
Think we are mountains but we're just pebbles
Better yet a sand grain
Go pop a little champagne
But the people in the south of France are not our fans mate
Would love to live nice and happy too
But ask yourself this
And if you knew the business deals man are negotiating
In case you're mistaken
Revolution on my track
Been right there from right back
What happened the last time I lost my temper
And believe I ain't trying to be hard
The abuse that I suffered
I'm emotionally scarred
Supposed to be only beholding the bars
Instead I'm a professor that never went to class
When you compare me to these little tarts
All you are showing is you're not very smart
Real MC it's my culture
Grew up on the sound systems with the toasters
Tenth planet ain't not another one near to me
Come out my face with that nonsense
Never do we run from one of these kids
If we ain't shook with the owners of the plantation
That love us enough to wanna die for us
One two one two face of the haters
Man are chasing freedom
But papers are making and blatantly shaking and quaking in their boots
Anytime you talk about breaking enslavement
Why is everybody so scared of the agents
When they are powerless blatant
Listen to the shit that I spit in my rhymes
Even if it means that I don't get heard
Their hating the nerd
So I tell a man so straight I'm a nerd
Cold as a blizzard in a furnace
Riddles that I chisel in stone
Ask for yourself on the road
He kicks knowledge for the block
Progression on my albums
This whole shit is chess
And they want us to celebrate the fact that we are just pawns
The last thing they want is man with road energy
To stop killing one another and think cleverly
And ask why you're living where you're living and how you're living
Is it really for the hood
If our oppressors like our lyrics
If only by crushing your aspirations
Can they maintain this here situation
Only by destroying the dreams of your kids quick
Can they keep their unearned privileges
We all got tugs on the road that spit lead
What you choose to promote what's your intent
Man done hundreds of shows no deal
Can count countries I been and I still
Ill shit kill shit red and blue pill shit
Talk sense but tugs still feel shit
14 in coliseum with big women
Every other week when the shots kept ringing
So pardon me if I don't give a fuck lately
But half of these bars emcees wanna spray me
Only care if you wanna educate me
Or great emcee like Biggie was baby
I've no response if you hate me
Don't lie to yourself claim that you don't rate me
Who else can make intelligence seem sexy
Grown man don't run when I get a wreck
Push the mind sex and I change the technique
I'm so cool playing the game
But I make my own rules
I'm so cool stay in your lane
Or you'll get took to school
I'm so cool playing the game
But I make my own rules
Many man talk shit but they got no talent
Everything that I spit classic
Known from Sudan to Zimbabwe the hard way
Teaching my shit in the schools since the first disc
In the truest sense of the word have you heard prick
It's a new day absurd with my nerd shit
Never run from no guy and see men bleed
You ain't out there on the street
But I don't need to pretend that I am
I'd rather fight with the right foe that has stole land
Soul stone cold put a price on your soul man
You can take my wisdom for weakness sweetness
Or... just pack the jails
I'm so cool playing the game
But I make my own rules
I'm so cool stay in your lane
Or you'll get took to school
I'm so cool playing the game
But I make my own rules
A military mind since back in 04
Who's relevant from then it's oh so poor
Emcees come through and the last one sees
And I'm bleeding and breathing the meaning we feel it
Don't want credit for the message I discuss
A bop when I spit the fire in the booth
You ain't the only bro that knows criminals
They're way too serious for all of that crap
Few emcees have got the game twisted
And if they were around there would be less killing
And if you must die then die for the right cause
Scheming on a better dream
Die for your Kids home
Don't die for a dumb block that you don't own
I'm so cool playing the game
But I make my own rules
I'm so cool stay in your lane
Or you'll get took to school
I'm so cool playing the game
But I make my own rules
I ain't got the answer
Any boy can bust a nut
Takes a man to be a father and a partner
So we fuck and flee the glee of dicks harder
See every man wants to be loved as much as women do
Especially in these streets when we pose like a killer do
And I ain't saying I'm perfect
And I ain't saying they're perfect they would admit they ain't
Male supremacy got us thinking it's cool
And women are just objects we do things to
Growing up in this world with no father figures
Growing up in this cold world with only mothers
Trying their hardest to be a man
If most mothers acted exactly like most daddies do
There would be an even bigger bigger bag of homeless youths
How many so called tugs
That grew up with only mums
What if daddy stayed around
Showed him what a man was about
What if he wasn't 8 when he became the man of the house
It's a reminder of the beatings that he gave her
How he mentally enslaved her
All the while he was abusing she looked at him like a savior
But nobody but herself could save her
And now her eldest son in and out of the prison and women like his daddy
And daughter 15 dropping a baby on the family
Growing up in this world with no father figures
Growing up in this cold world with only mothers
Trying their hardest to be a man
What about the daughters
We always hear about the boys madness
What about the girls born to a dad absent
On to the next piece of skirt with a thin dress
And she after any affection she can have in a man
Same type of girl we turn and call a slag
Been 15 and suicidal sad
I don't know what it was
If we have half the parents
I don't know if it's necessarily better
And turn up just like you
Providing entertainment for your cultural betters
With propaganda each and every hour that's why
A symbol over the globe
The most rebellious thing you can do is get educated
When we speak of education
Free your body free your mind
Gotta know the basics
We can look around say that we hate it but
But how do we change it
Gotta step into the mind that designed ya
What do you reckon when you step into the fire
Act like you're lesser than better
I know a bag of youths that act like they ain't clever
So you want to hide something from Blacks
Then you should put it in a book
Look at the means that they tell us you make all the P's
Dumb celebrities say girls act like you're me
We want a bag of hookers that bend over and just cook
Our silicone addressers do anything to impress us
Of course a woman's life is lived just for the fellas
But there's nothing more unattractive than a woman that play dumb
But the ego with a reason to see you
Lesser than equal to be you
At all the bullshit that we do deceitful
I wouldn't want to be you
But know the one whose head needs to get severed
Behind my painted smile
When all the revolutionary noise is nothing but a lost little boy
An egotistical prick so come on please praise me more
It's great that my music bettered you
But I contemplate murder every day so don't put me on a pedestal
In my better moments I could let the universe use me
Behind my smile there's generations of pain
Decimated the place where my dead relations were slain
Not just physically but mentally penetrated our veins
What you got inside hasn't gotta die once
Behind the painted smile
Behind my painted smile is the most painful grimace
To grow up brown in Britain and know that your living
Was paid for by a carcass that resembles yours
Born in the heart of the empire
You're worth more than I was just like you
But less then the native ones
Raised by my mum but in this world I am a father's son
Done many things that I regret and never knew the reason
I don't wanna die in prostration to European's
They say the answer is within you and nowhere else
Understand the vision man on a mission to know himself
Behind the painted smile
The smile is painted on my face is tainted by a frown
Picture in the pocket's of blood that decorate the town
Then everyone that's dead was somebody's someone
Behind my painted smile I feel like a naked child
Up early though I search and roam along this dirty road
All this talk of intervention to protect on what is the intention
Same as it ever was the colonial past and present
And more respect for most of the right wingers
Than the paternalistic patronizing liberal bigot
Select war and export the British dream
Behind cinema screens there's much that isn't seen
The trouble was the bloody cops had me running in and out the bloody dock
I ain't a stranger to having my back on their blue plastic
Can't keep us captive
Behind the painted smile
Look at their attitudes
Who Knows what the truth is
Of yourself then you're in my prison
Can you fathom the insanity
Of believing the truth is held by a few
And it ain't me or you
Ain't no truths just points of view
If it ain't known then is it still true
How is that enlightening
For those that don't speak the language
Or is god that underhanded
That he'd act just about as dumb as man is
People just wanna feel important
Reporting ideas of the truth extorting
Those without nothing are the ones that brought in
Look at religion its almost deporting
Hard to admit that the world we're brought in
We ain't got a clue what the fuck the force is
That makes uncountable stars in the cosmos
Easy like a painter doing odd jobs
Accept that we don't know what's what
All gonna die anyway so what's lost
Just ideas that are sold so well
By all the people with power and privilege
Telling you to wait for the afterlife
They Ain't gotta live with half the strife
For anyone that tries to take your power
And use it in their way selfish
You're as divine as anybody else is
Anyone that tries to trouble your loved ones
That is the time and the place that you can buss guns
Look how quickly we become accustom
To picture the paper that's pretty
The price of a tenant to live in the city
Life were defending has ever been shitty
They write all the endings and never been with me
Blinded by noise of the poise of pension
Are we ready to understand it
In its fullest cultural state
Beyond its useless branding
Beyond the story that keeps us telling us the common myth
But lets not pretend there was no foundation to this art
Birth of hip hop runs far deeper within our veins
Before there was Jazz
Before there was Blues
Before the whips the ships and all the tragedy
Before we were stripped of Knowledge of our cultural anatomy
You could be hip hop for generations you're still family
You must have had a cultural base to even produce it
The schools of Timbuktu they already knew
The cycles of the planet and the motion of the moon
150 years before Galileo check it
And medieval Benin's in the Guinness book of records
A story telling musician poet and history keeper
The tradition still exists today but it could get neglected
In its fullest context not just as a product of the hood
It's that cultural memory go and ask Steven
If you know we lost our language then you know what has happened
The base of its is African
It's not about excluding nobody its just accurate...
Never that's your wealth
Never that's your wealth
Look around hip hop's becomes this global voice
But we must understand its roots so we can have a choice
What we should do with it how to use it
How to teach our students
But it will use this culture for its prostitution
The ghetto dilemma's as bad as its ever been
Roots of the rhythm and bass
If I'm uncomfortable you shouldn't mention it
I'm superior so watch your sentences
Don't disturb my privileged pensioners
Living off ignorance of all the members of
Every one of all the people we severed off
Never one of all the people we're never soft
Any gun or the better we sell it off
Any sum of all the cheddar we level off
Cultural suicide is a necessity
To get you to worship celebrity
When they say that Knowledge ain't for you and your people
Or the places you was raised in
Or the shape of your faces
Degrees or bank statements
So we gotta reject Whatever they set
They're never benevolent yet
Yet we sit at a desk Collecting a check
No need to ever respect
Mess coupled by death
Look at the West and the rest
Transfer knowledge transfer the power then tell me what is left
It just just his head that is numbing the pain
Only the clever shit should ever change
Our development towards an aim
Training the muscle is training the brain
It is the same if you push through the pain
Once you are strong you are never the same
Your manner your swagger
The way that you stand up
The way that you work with your boys as a rapper
I've seen a killer convert from a trapper
I am not telling you it will get better
But if we are to fight we must keep our jab up
Existence is resistance in a world that
Thinks the human instinct should be held back
And all of our wisdom we we should sell that
Destroy the difference that we all have
And make use clones for the throne
Serving their agendas
Even when we think we oppose
We're really their defenders
Look at what is given to those
To fold to the goddess of gold and be cold henchmen
For stars spangled with banners
That dangles cars as carrots
Strangle Mars with cannons
Mangle arms with malice
And channel arms so callous
And banish bards that challenge
And challenge half the planet
With a British dog on a leash
We are the bringers of peace into the Middle of East
You are invited to Feast
On the tasty flesh of a beast
It might be someone's seed
But why worry there is no need
We intravenously feed
They wanted to own their own wealth
And they are not part of us
Most of the time I think of myself
And I can palm it off
Sometimes I think of the world
It gets me started off
So so what do we do now
Or go back to the way we've always done it
Whatever we do there's always gonna be division
Whatever we do they're just gonna build another prison
So let's just do nothing and let it all happen
Whatever we do the universe just keeps on giving
Whatever we do the Earth will always keep on spinning
Whatever we knew we still won't understand beginnings
So let's just do nothing and let it all happen
Existence is resistance in a world that
Thinks the human instinct should be held back
And all of our wisdom we should sell that
Destroy the difference that we all have
Every freedom we believe we're receiving this evening
But believing is deceiving
When there's no meaning
Spouted from the mouths of a clout
So let us scramble for the globe until everything folds
As long as pockets always have enough dollars to fold
As long as rockets always have enough venom to scold
That has not come to succumb to a murderer's tongue
From the palace of permanent slums
From whoever will sell you the Sun
And sell it back to whoever can give you the funds
But I don't know if we lost or we won
A lack of answers won't stop as asking the question
So so what do we do now
Or go back to the way we've always done it
Whatever we do there's always gonna be division
Whatever we do they're just gonna build another prison
So let's just do nothing and let it all happen
Whatever we do the universe just keeps on giving
Whatever we do the Earth will always keep on spinning
Whatever we knew we still won't understand beginnings
So let's just do nothing and let it all happen
Existence is resistance in a world that
Thinks the human instinct should be held back
And all of our wisdom we should sell that
Destroy the difference that we all have
Please tell me what's the mission
Is what is driven through my lyrics
Not that I don't put my heart and my soul in the words
If the bars are changing the Earth
How arrogant to believe we can change it
Only slightly less arrogant than those
Who believe that we can't
We may just crumble the house of cards
Never to slumber it's strength in numbers
Or never should ever you pen to the page
The coroner could not determine his age
Hard as a foreigner earning a wage
From the conservative nerd of a sage
Written in the ink of the blood of a slave
No cotton so burn on a wage
Buried at the bottom of the ocean of rage
Existence is resistance
Or at least let me sleep with ease
Convince myself to at least release me
I wanna be more than my wealth more than my health
I think I need your help
Be all that I can more than a man that I am
But still not someone else
I put you down just projecting weight by the pound
That drowns my direction
Hate by the pound surrounds my reflection
I do this for my own protection
I wanna be more than myself
I think I need your help
This song ain't gonna write itself
I think I need your help
This wrong ain't gonna right itself
I think I need your help
I wanna be more than you know
I wanna be more than myself
I think I need your help
I wanna be more than you know
I wanna be more than myself
I think I need your help
I wanna be more than you know
I just do the best that I can as a man
They ask and its easy to answer
I think I have found what I seem to be after
I wanna tune to your rhythm
I want a guide that relies on your wisdom
Open my eyes is closing my vision
So it's no surprise that I notice division
I wanna be more than the ordinary
Just a robot you know what
You could just order me
I wanna be more than myself
I think I need your help
This song ain't gonna write itself
I think I need your help
This wrong ain't gonna right itself
I think I need your help
I wanna be more than you know
I wanna be more than myself
I think I need your help
I wanna be more than you know
I wanna be more than myself
I think I need your help
I wanna be more than you know
In divided communities still residing is unity
Waiting to show itself soon as we're ready to see it
So we can keep pretending what's real is just the senses
But it is all the same when you're looking with stronger lenses
We are so busy noticing money don't grow on trees
We forgot that food does and that it's the food that we need
And seen the poorest people with the wealthiest smiles
It often is the oddest of songs that tomorrow sings
We find all these reasons
To never be the person we want to be
Because I'm still healing
All these wounds that are buried
We think that we're smart and that makes us dumb
Think that we feel the most and that makes us numb
Weak because we're convinced that we have the power
We're just waves but think we're the ocean
Because it's easier then admitting
We don't know where the current is going
Waves just rolls with the ocean until they reach the sand
That's what it is for
I don't wanna romanticize another time that's gone by
But I have to be honest and tell you that
So some Nina Simone is gonna put me in the zone
Quicker then some talk of Patron
Or Crystal or Pistol it's oh so tedious
I want to hear some tunes
Like strange fruit with meaning in
I want to hear the wolf howling and the waters muddy
A little touch of Dennis Brown
I love the soul but nothing moves me like that Reggae sound
Our black American cousins are big influences
On the songs we are singing
It's all Soul with Africa at it's base
I'm quite sure the right chords are a cure for disease
The legend Stevie Wonder comes bursting out through the wire
There is something about the old sound on the analogue
And real musicianship that we just can't carry on
Or maybe I just am an old soul romanticizing
About the good old days when Miles Davis was a commercial artist
When singers could sing soul
And if you saw them live they sounded better than the record
But how would I know I was not even on the globe
When most of these artists rocked
Like I've been here before
When you're listening to records
Or contemplating the questions
Do you find yourself talking about the kids these days
If it's only Reggae or Soul since you were five years old
You know you're an old soul
If you ain't found something to die for
If you ain't found something to die for you'll never live
We might feed and breathe but we never did
Except those with peace and equality
That don't see what we call authority
Live and speak truth and kill them for
We love them dead when they speak no more
Tooth of truth it's impossible to pull it loose
Scream at the top of your lungs like a siren
If you ain't found something to die for
But the one who has nothing has nothing to lose
More things we don't need will make more thieves
More laws we don't heed it's all Siamese
New driver but we got no brakes
The master never ever frees his slave
But we've been too divided to ever be guided through it
To sell us a love song and we're so besotted
But there are some that lead more honest
If you ain't found something to die for
Now spread democracy by dropping a bomb
On a terrorist with no shoes or socks
The bigger terrorist is the one with the bigger weapons
They talked but we didn't listen
We can't see all the things that imprison us
If you ain't found something to die for
Once upon a time in an obscure part of the Milky Way Galaxy
There was a spinning ball of water and rock ruled by the forces of evil.
Decided to call a special banquet for the greatest thieves in all the land
Inviting them to attend his palace at the dawn of the new moon
Each thief would be given a chance to stake his claim
As the greatest messenger of murder upon the planet
And the Devil himself would then decide who should be crowned king.
Have been found far short of the required level of wickedness
And there were just four sets of thieves left in the competition
Each set of thieves appointed a spokesman to give his case to the Devil
We have recorded these events for posterity
First up was the thief of the worst reputation
He looked the Devil in the eye as he spoke
I am the greatest thief there has ever been on Earth
Please tell me who else more than me personifies your work
I proved to masters in the west
I could kill my own people just as well as the best
Sent squads of death to those who would suggest
In power should be the one they elect
Erected a statue of the great man
Even outlawed my indigenous culture
And language and history
And taught our people to only worship colonizers
The banquet of the thieves...
The Devil was so impressed with this wonderful man
He almost ejaculated on his hands
But the monarch of the empire said
Deliberate starvation of whole nations
He would love to be trading places
I've been doing this ting on the roads
Since the Middle Ages
Everybody knows he's a criminal element
They think I'm democratic and benevolent
And that shows that I'm really devilish
I couldn't care about democracy
You all know no one elected me
The people love me despite my crimes
The banquet of the thieves...
I'm a pervert who's in the cloak of the clergy
I'm a despicable character
I use my position of authority and spiritual reverence
I'm a despicable character
For all of the religious leaders that leech
I thought you would like it
How I use their faith in God to keep them blinded
And they believe that I am not a crook
Tell them God will repay them in the next
They give me their life savings so I can buy jets
All the reports about child sex
None of us have ever gone to jail yet
Convinces the victims their lives have meaning
Monarchs boast about conquest
But needed my blessings to get it done
And all of the dictators use my books
The Devil was sure this was the winner
And was just about to put an end to the dinner
But then the man from the banking cartel
I think I'm the biggest sinner
All of those three depend on me
All they ever do is defending me
I turned science's basic appliance
Into a client of weapon and war
I make monopolies out of property
Never shot a gun nor killed anyone myself
The people need me just to connect it
Yet none of them knows what I look like
Yet all of them spend my money to look nice
I hold the keys to every single door
I'll even sell freedom for the right price
But no one is smart enough to ask me nice
If you don't give it to me
What is this thing I see
This silly little thing called me
We that think that we know we are not reverent
But we don't even yet know if we're relevant
Is this all that there is
What is this thing I see
This silly little thing called we
By judging a man by just what's in his hands
See your code of address or the code of your dress
We all still use that same hole for our breath
Playing the game but there's never a Ref
And you can't take it with you if ever you left
Is this all that there is
What is this thing I see
Are we elevating our meditation
Generation television's raising
Yet we're complaining about how they're behaving
Washing our hands or just bathing with Satan
Because actually there is no tax on our living
It's a fact though it's naturally hidden
Our December is cold as it's ever been
Is this all that there is
True words are never beautiful
Beautiful words are never true
Every truly clear thing
Every door that you open
A key to another one that's broken
Every word that is spoken
And the more that we focus
The less we ever seem to notice
It's like the sound of the letterbox early in the morning
But you know it's nothing good
Just a red letter warning
Sucking every penny that we got
All this pressure on my back
I got an idea just why that might be
It's just how we live
It's something with how we live
It's something with how we live
It's something with how we live
It's just how we live
True words are never beautiful
Beautiful words are never true
The one who will never choose
The skin with no feeling is the one that will never bruise
To beat it you have to seek it
Beneath it you get the secret
Just what they're designed to do
Look close enough at your enemy
And you will find it's you
I got an idea just why that might be
It's just how we live
It's something with how we live
It's something with how we live
It's something with how we live
It's just how we live
True Words are never beautiful
Beautiful words are never true
The liar is the only one in the world that is never true
Fly all over the world but never move
Talk a lot about dreams but never do
Stuck in this position
Wishing we even had a mission
And wouldn't spend 40 years barely chasing a living
Job that we hate with a dying soul
Boss that we'd like to strangle slow
The partner we live with we don't even know
Because the man in the mirror is just another freak show
We're just bluffing the entire show
All of our discussions
And our fussing over the price of Gold
And they don't own it
It's we that make up the motive
It's we that make up the soldiers
They only stand on our shoulders
I've got an idea why the fuck that might be
We feel that we are not in control of our own lives
We see that we are not in control of our own lives
We taste that we are not in control of our own lives
It's clear that we are not in control of our own lives
It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD
It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD
Because we paid a hell of a cost
And don't really know what was lost
And the process ain't ever stopped
Since black civilization dropped
Through internal greed and external plot
Same ones that taught the Ancient Greeks
Greece and Rome helped to bring to their knees
Then Islam spread across Northern Africa
With slavery and massacres
Spread South and West and people dispersed
Christianity is not alone in using
Race and religion for power to expand
Desert caravans took slaves across Sand
Enemies always invented mythologies
There was some reinstatement of autonomous nations
Then floating on the waves of the seas
Really they were just dogs on two legs
Most welcomed them into our homes
We didn't know they had hearts of stone
Frozen by Western Europe's cold
And with that collaboration
Began the largest forced migration
In the history of nations
It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD
It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD
Thrown overboard like property stolen
Or jumped overboard rather than be sold on
What awaited was not just enslavement
But a genocidal impulse craving
They committed unspeakable abuses
To make a nigger from an African human
Took a woman ready to give birth
Tied her limbs to four posts held firm
In a main square made every slave watch
Covered her in raw meat
Let off a pack of dogs
Hang a man from a tree cut off his penis
And it was upon this here atrocity
Europe became the dominant economy
It's a scheme for unequal trade
Imagine the largest companies today
If all of their employees got no pay
For all of the centuries profit was made
Black skin was always branded slave
Even the child of the masters rape
Could be killed or sold because black blood in her veins
Probably don't know the Haitian revolution
Caused the French to sell half of America
Nor know the role that Africans played
In the Civil War for that same America
You probably believe what they told you
But if they set Africans free
Because all of a sudden they grow a conscience
Why were the slave masters given compensation
With the Belgians killing 10 million
Souls in the Congo alone
Why collaborators will work for such evil
Imperialism for the new age
But with a brown face on it
That's right imperialism for the new age
But with a brown face on it
It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD
It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD
Some will try their best to justify this torture
By asking you who the slaves were brought from
And the largest wars of humans
Were fought between the people of Western Europe
So by your rationale it's cool to kill Frenchman
They killed Germans that look like them
Different set of rules you can abide by
Dark suffering is not humanized
During the course of our parents life
And the freedoms we have only occurred
So it's our task to put an end to this
Even those like me with our heritage mixed
If a knife is in your back 9 inches
And it's only been pulled out six
When the wound starts healing
And we stop bleeding and bleaching
When the plague of self hate
Is no longer a weight so great
Push you to kill one another
When we put a stop to false charity
That gives with one hand and bombs with the other
No longer strangle our nations
When the invaders don't have military bases
When the jail cells are not packed with black backs
Not a few token bit part actors
When the truth is told and there is
The dignity to remember the dead
Because as long as they are distorting the past
It means they have the intention of doing it again
It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD
It's way bigger than the pain that I place on the CD
Silence is never to blame
Silence is always the same
But silence is not a game
Silence only explains
And talk and talk and talk a lot
But behind their talk is not
That goes with the rhetoric
Its bullshit even if you ain't smelling it
Even if you're misspelling it
Or a desk or a pound of flesh
When we make a person a decimal
Line syllable rhyme typical
Would it be better to mime lyrical
I'm just giving you my individual
Spin on the things that I've seen in the physical
Silence is always the wise
Silence is only a guide
But silence is in the mind
Silence is mostly the kind
See they say so many things
But then they clip so many wings
And they don't want anyone against
They try to dismiss our right to resist
Or to fight with the fist you gotta be joking
You must be toking or
In the only way that it has been
Ever since any time that I can tell
Maybe its nature we're battling
The hunters trap that's left for the prey
But these predators will only
Get fed from filling our heads
With the words that they say
If you have more or you can guess the rest
The story is an old one
In my time on this earth I have told some
With a Line syllable rhyme typical
Would it be better to mime lyrical
I'm just giving you my individual
Spin on the things that I've seen in the physical
A word only defines another word
That a poet would try to persuade you
The words you relate to
Are nothing compared to the nothing that happens when nothing
I suppose what I mean is this
If I really had peace of mind
I probably wouldn't speak that much
And I probably would not write these rhymes
So many things to say
So many things to say
So many things to say
A game named life where fools make the rules
And poets paint pictures with words that change nothing
And nature is indifferent to the suffering of infants
That think ourselves growing human beings and something special
It seems we shape every place that we grace with hate
Depending which side of the fence or which epoch
You die a slow death or be singing from the treetops
I don't know if we will ever roll another time round
It's a game named life
Where the dice decide where I go
And poets paint pictures with words that change nothing
In a game that teaches children to kill but can't love them
A piece of earth made to blow holes in souls
Because they know they left the spirit world
To live here with no meaning among demons
That see them as nothing more than chess pieces
In a game named life where even the winners stop breathing
And the whole thing is as tedious as a tale that is told twice
We clone life but don't even own our own life
It's a game named life
Where the dice decide where I go
This game named life is over
Life is a mirror always looking at you
With the time that is given it comes with no ribbon
Because life is not a gift to everyone that's living
Most of the moves are made before you took your first go
Some got a huge head start before their first role
So you could play with more skill than the other players
They will still be head because the past generations
Accumulated spaces so they could practice with acres
Illuminated arrangements so they could manage retainers
So they have won before even the game starts unless we change it
To another set of rules different from the fools
But to do that we are going to have to use their tools
And therein lies our greatest dilemma
It's a game named life
Where the dice decide where I go
It's a game named life
Where the dice decide where I go
Towards the end of the feast the devil decided
In fact he said he would just retire
To keep our children living in fire
Could be supplied by these thieves and these liars
Who had respectable titles
So he pronounced that he would bounce
Go back to hell as his house
We know not what what was said
But still live with the effects
Of what was agreed by the greed
That night on the Banquet of thieves
All of the powers for ruling the globe
Only to those who would sell their soul
And take the devilish oath
I solemnly swear to steal and kill
Not because I'm hungry for meals
But because my hundreds and millions
I wanna see turned into billions
I solemnly swear to make a place
Where women and children are raped every day
Where some eat ourselves to death
And others can't get a crumb on the plate
I solemnly swear to turn the globe
Into a living hell for most
That grows or has a pulse
Had one more course before they could complete the Banquet
The end of their tantrums came
When they were stabbed in the heart with a stake
All the thieves gobbled down the children without a second thought
They should leave the game
For the hollow concept called profit so known as personal gain
So treat this life as if it was nothing more than a monopoly game
There's people to starve and people to slaughter
An angry devil will be forced to return from the comfort of hell
All the thieves got up from their seats and gave the devil applause
With that the devil vanished
And left the thieves in the palace
The banker was the first to speak on how they could meet the challenge
Look my fellow thieves
As long as we unite on the scheme
We'll be living with dreams
There's never been a team this mean
Is what I provide at the Devil's behest
Monarchs can make laws and the courts
That would serve and protect
Our interests and nothing else
Commoners can fuck themselves
That's where I can add some value
To this gathering of men
I can kill in broad daylight
I don't have to pretend
I can do the things that all you rich developed countries
Can't be seen to do in public
But we all know you love it
Though we couldn't be further from the truth we are practically lovers
You're quite right Mr. Banker deception must be used
We'll hire prostitutes to spread our views
Another set of prostitutes that call themselves artists
To say what we tell them to
Thou art a wonderful thief
The last thing that we do need before our schemes complete
Is a set of puppet politicians
That the people think hold the power but they're really our dogs
Let us drink to murder and theft
Until there's nothing left
The thieves took a toast of warm blood
And nearly drowned in laughter
The Bankers passed out a charter
That they had carefully drafted
If we could sign this in blood
They used the child's bleeding finger
To keep the human spirit a prisoner
That's how it's been since then
A cannibalistic system
Run by themes dressed in death
Don't force me to remind you why
The half breed seed sprouting his disease
Could break the back of my occupation
Cooperation is the only clever option open
Any choice you're given is fake
Kinda like you voting
Now you wanna question the very wisdom that guided you
Sounding like enlightened fools
Running from a spiteful brawl
But in my city we don't know how to be nice at all
We know the knife and tool
And that life has rules
We turn a stanza to a cancer with poetic banter
So no factor that chat which rappers crack
If we believe your act that you believe that you can rap
The impact on the head of the hard headed
In the ring with the king of the paragraphs
Your twinkle toes and pretty pose could never dazzle
The one who throws a million souls and it's never hassle
Smash you a hole that is big enough to snatch your soul through
Maybe in your culture suicide is being brave
The sage of the page makes graves plagued with dark ages
And ain't no choice to be buried I only do cremating
For little idiots that's not even rated
Not even hated not even a factor that needs to be calculated
In the plainest terms
But fools never learn
I spit a sentence quick like a judge with a coon in the dock
But these clowns with their dead sound hate me
In 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue
Today we celebrate the rapist and his fucked up past
When the culture values dogs more than certain humans
It is certain it will come up with the worst solution
Nowadays the language has change
But it's the same shit since the Nazi's did within Europe
What Europeans was only supposed to do to natives
But will still give you a blessing yeah
In fact it was some grub who packed triggers and mug
We're living through the fall of the empire
We're living through the fall of the empire
And we don't even know what is meant by it
And we don't even know what is meant by it
We're living through the fall of the empire
We're living through the fall of the empire
And we don't even know what is meant by it
And we don't even know what is meant by it
Raping and pillaging will never succeed
We're living in the age of information
I call is straight piss taking
Call it money or lose your debt making
Our society is broken down
So I don't get a loan or credit cards
See that is out of bounds
We're living through the fall of the empire
We're living through the fall of the empire
And we don't even know what is meant by it
And we don't even know what is meant by it
Colonize and savage take what is a land
Then we justify it by claiming that we already had it
We ain't talking bout music when we say tours
Tell our kids every day that crime don't pay
But there's no way we believe the bullshit we say
The light is lighting up the way
Supply arms to both sides in the fight
And if you ain't fighting you ain't paying attention to your alliance
Till their empires done and another one gets its turn
We're living through the fall of the empire
We're living through the fall of the empire
And we don't even know what is meant by it
And we don't even know what is meant by it
Any which way some of you want to come through
Any which way some of you want to come through
The art of fighting without fighting
Or fighting when you need to
Equal whatever you bring we'll meet you
This sport is a war with a discourse
Same energy known for the sick tours
Record a track I do the same thing live
Wake up when it's still dark in the sky
With the heart for the grind and an art full of rhymes
And the sharpest of lines and a spark of the mind
So bright that I'm leaving them partially blind
Any which way some of you want to come through
Any which way some of you want to come through
I'm a man on a mission
Don't let I catch you slipping
I've been studying the art of war
Now every little son of a gun seems to think
From the moment they come out their mum they are the one
Without ever having what it takes to become
Ten lifetimes ain't enough
I was a Mayan priest but not in the movies
I was a druid pouring out fluid
Hundred more times I was born before
Energy and memory it remains
In my veins and it don't take much to reclaim
All I gotta do is say my own name
Name is a thousand thumps with a pool stick
That reigns on a silly little punk for the bullshit
Tell your G's I'll believe that they're all sick
Yet you are never there
Any which way some of you want to come through
Any which way some of you want to come through
I'm a man on a mission
Don't let I catch you slipping
I've been studying the art of war
But you've gotta tell them that you're past wanting followers
Kill rate way past choleras
They wanna reign high but we come to be levelers
We know the design and we're done with the evidence
Go with the times get bun for the hell of it
Any which way some of you want to come through
Any which way some of you want to come through
I'm a man on a mission
Don't let I catch you slipping
Might as well bury my head in the sand and run from the world
It's easy to let the world get you down
Rags to rags lot that never climb higher
The ladder of fucking over other people the best
This we know in our heart
Yet we pick up the dice and play a part
Kick over the whole game with no shame
Might as well bury my head in the sand and run from the world
The sun comes up now and I ain't had a blink
I think too bloody much
See in my deeper moments
Like we ain't involved with anything promoted than to focus on our own little selves
The rest can go to hell
Specially at those times I wanna flee from reality
Might as well bury my head in the sand and run from the world
And of course naked oppression
Cause you are not a fool and the teacher's horrible
Or giving in to the times that I'm trapped in
I contemplate all the others overcoming their fears
Fighting battles far harder so that I could be here
Then I feel like the silly little boy that I am
Count my blessings in the moment and get back to the plan
Inspiration is the strangest thing
But it's the only way to explain the voices inside of you
Only satisfied when you are inspired to
Might as well bury my head in the sand and run from the world
Every shot that thunders
Through the nighttime don't you wonder
What potential was extinguished
Through the underworld and over world
Principles are so the same
Though we pretend they're not as if they do not control cocaine
But you'll find it's connected
Every kid in the hood that's living with a death wish
But he is just much more reckless
It's the King that I'm talking about
Though he is born with a silver spoon in his mouth
He still gonna clap for the slightest of chat
At any world leader that can't back it
If he is sitting on the boxes
They are just oil or mineral deposits
Food he is moving fucking with our profit
That is just not true
If you ain't got guns to protect that money
Only murder further agendas that money couldn't force
Eliminate the foes who propose
A little torture is usually a big supporter
Though there's nothing quite like killing
Good riddance to non supporters
We worship murder so much
It's just that he ain't killed enough
You wanna commit murder
You gotta make it to the Premier League
A thousand murders plus
They just didn't know
Murder runs the globe
Every knife that puncture lungs of sons
If he was born to billionaires backed by a hundred guns
Instead of dead where it don't count
We expect you to be killed
Because living as a pauper is a fate that is tainted
Acquainted with torture
We ain't debating the rape of the daughter
If she was raised in particular borders
Place that fate made particular slaughters
No fate just particular orders
It's the way of the world no accident
In fact it's immaculate
You got a big gun start clapping it
Any silly biddy little pacifist or activist or challenges
Brown or black skin savages
Who inhabiting land with minerals in it
Who think for a minute that the rhetoric we spoke
Don't dream compassion will happen it won't
Just go straight for the throat
Because any nation or races
That prove themselves incapable
Of matching modern murder machines
It is murder not money we desire insatiable
What you can't do with a bribe
Can be achieved in a breeze with a gun and a knife
Because only murder further agendas that money couldn't grind
They just didn't know
Murder runs the globe
Let's get a little clarity
You ain't got the capacity to internationally
Have a say in the ways things happening
You expect to collect more battering
Your arsenal it ain't got no nukes
Armies equipped with too few troops
We're laughing at you when you call truce
You got no background in colonization
Or public resource privatization
But you still wanna play like Satan
You got no death squads to call your own
Or a pilot to fly your drones
Much less bulldozers for their homes
Even he went jail for tax evasion
For missing a payment in the payment plan
And a hidden fist to enforce my plan
I am just because I can more wicked than the Summer of Sam
You bust your gun and I bomb your land
Only murder further agendas that money can't control
They just didn't know
Murder runs the globe
If murder runs the globe and this we know and accept
What do we expect but mass murders to live happily
Those who really fight for freedom to face tragedy
When you really look at the world do you feel a sickness
The state murder is still murder its still murder
There's no fight that's big enough to conceal murder
Lets make a movie and celebrate our real murder
But never question your oppressors or suggest murder
Should be directed in your betters that invest murder
I wonder is it absurd that we protest murder
That murder has both helped and harmed you and I
To defend themselves from oppressors with a greater might
When you see a child's body like a dog in the streets believe
When there is no justice and we can't breath
Terrorism is its own religion practiced by millions
Obviously not just Muslim but also Jewish and Christian
Since when has belief
Ever stopped human beings
They pretend one terror is worse terror
Even while they sponsor their terror it works better
Even while they bomb their countries and burn them up
Even while they colonize them with no letter
Rappers can't bring you liberation
Are you one of these assholes like me
But knows that It won't come so easily
And revolutionary love there needs to be
Everyone has the right to defend the one they love
And no uniform gives you the right to shed my blood
If the courts systematically denies what we're legally due
When you see a child's body like a dog in the streets believe
When there is no justice and we can't breath
Nations and nuclear bombs and colonizers
Applaud us for our silence reward us for non violence
While supporting old tyrants
Calling them all clients
They bought them with a fortune a slice of the empire
Of course they haven't taught them torture is a science
Feel the force of the fires
Petrol poured on the tires
Bet it more than retires
Several daughters in silence
Whichever mothers are crying
Justice is just like anything
If you can't afford to buy it than you starve
This is our world that I'm describing
When you see a child's body like a dog in the streets believe
When there is no justice and we can't breath
My artillery's full to the brim
With a criminal syllable peel back skin
If you take on him I will break your kin
With the words I'm ashame him
Spiritual mind elevation
Back through time on the back of the rhyme
Shackles align through back of my spine
Capturing rhyme all the facts in the line
Claiming they wanna slew me
Do what you you gotta do G
I quite like fighting I've made that clear
Take your career and replace it with tears
The Shakespeare is here I take fear and peer
Into the hearts of men and show you they're cowards
Like five man on earth that can rap with this shower
My roots go 10 miles down in the earth
Who wants what with he kid I'm the best
I don't mean it in jest like most rappers do
Has been so consistent with blistering speed
Put things over a person
Verbally I'm worser than the most of the worst of em
I mangle more man that banners starred spangled
You look dumber than man wearing socks with their sandals
Who said you'll go through with no pain
They should have told you it is no gain
The A with the A with the A with the A
And I stay every day every day every day
Some prick just defending the system
You don't wanna ramp with these
The flows so cold better hold your receipt
That I won't rumble for lunches
Fuck crews I'm taking on countries
10 years and I've been round the world twice
And I'm 10 times guys that your friends hype
I don't know the meaning and how to achieve them
I was thinking how freedom is
But that's the kind of freedom
That's crazy and make appealing
And all other forms of freedom
Is crazy dangerous demons
Pray your brains on the ceilings
For entertaining the meaning
It requires a critical
Master the population
Not following the typical
In fact it ain't even shock anymore
Dining on fine dinners
While preaching to us about freedom
When I feel like to wonder
Don't want to feel like I'm under
It's musical medicine
Dude want to collide with us
We fighting the spiritual war
Can I get a further witness
I can free myself for more these cowards
The biggest enemy ain't a coward
My biggest enemy is the enemy
If knowledge is power then tell me please what is freedom
Can you define a single word that has many meanings
Is definition another prisoner that we believe in
Can you be free in prison sitting in your cell
Can you be free of the system when you living in hell
Can you be free if the vision is too difficult to tell
If we live to tell the tale
If we will ever break the spells that they telling us well
Free from the pressure
Free from the lies they tell us in the history lessons
We've been on this ting for so long now
10 years at the top of my craft
Maybe not at the top of the charts
But who could tell me what independent touring the globe
And flows as cold as winter was in hand me down clothes
Seems I was born to be what you ain't
A man that uses his art to fight
But still prospers in these hard times
The respects so high that
Left you in a jail full of lifers
But don't respect the system made by the killers
The ones that paint us as the villains
We've been on this ting for so long now
We've been on this ting for so long now
It's no excuse to be boring cause you tell the truth
Ain't having a bar for none of these artists
That not giving a fuck gives me strength
But defend what I have to
We've been on this ting for so long now
We've been on this ting for so long now
Punish every punk that is posing the hardest
Told you we tarnish those that are garbage
Get left for dead for opposing the carnage
But we are grown me so only grown women
I swear that your Brazilian
Harder than the life of a black man in Italy
We've been on this ting for so long now
I don't like to lose my temper but they give you no choice
So when they are faced with us that are basic
It's the tone of a pompous git when he's on your shit
And he just make you wanna spit
But you just wanna humble a mug
Move peaceful with abundance of love
But you're not a prick and he muddled you up
Taking him out with a straight to the mouth
Sometimes that's all they understand
Taking him out and then straighten him out
Must've confused you with him and his friend
But when you blow your gasket shit gets drastic
Hype as an Irish man on St. Patrick's
I don't like to lose my temper and it don't happen that often
Sometime somebody wanna be a problem
And nothing else will stop them
Other than knowing that physical conflict ain't off the roster
It's just a day when a little mug gets
How it could get when the left hook checks
That same mouth that spouted the mess
Unless they trouble your mum
That's what the elbow's for to attack that
Everyone on a knife and a gun
Over the hype so let's get old school
It's part of living this life
I don't know what to say
Along the way many wrongs in this place
The things were better before
I ain't sure that they matter anymore
In my mind a thousand characters battle to be heard
Each one screaming at the top of there lungs
So I can't make out a word
One of the fools within my cranium
For good communication
And the beating ceases a million Jigsaw pieces
Shards of my shattered childhood fit together so easy
And violence has meaning
That's me projecting back
From the space I am now
When you in and you live it
It is more than just horrible
Any day you wake up feel your life can end now
Don't quote me statistics
That won't cure the fear
When I can see the life expectancy of half of my peers
I done made it to thirty
Further than my mother though
But never did get caught
Maybe the strength from my mind
Or good old fashion luck will explain it just fine
That's why T never passed the stick that night
At time the logical promise was to just cock and squeeze
The pride and the confines of my mind
Funny how the shit work
The way we all grew up
To see other young brothers face straight screw up
Now I see my brothers and I see my reflection
Don't mean I ain't prepared for the worst
It mean I just ain't expecting
And needing direction
I no longer feel the need to mask as aggression
It's part of living this life
I don't know what to say
Along the way many wrongs in this place
The things were better before
I ain't sure that they matter anymore
In my mind I would die for the things I believe
But one of the mind's greatest powers is how it deceives
Till your people die a lot
Still you got to maintain conviction and never try and stop
Nor can I tell you surely
On what's not been put before me
But what the mind conceives
And skin bleaching and such other sickness
Must be understood within us
Multiple much layered image
Yet a million different mind's results the same
Like we share a power source
Can't disconnect from the mains
Yet I call this mind mine
Though I know not its aim
It's part of living this life
I don't know what to say
Along the way many wrongs in this place
The things were better before
I ain't sure that they matter anymore
N my mind there's a nation of its own
But nor am I the servant
More like an observer
Powerless to stop myself
Witnessing the murder
It's occurring and recurring
Making up the wording
So I don't know the plot
Even though I am on screen
To the credits to from the opening shot
And that may sound cryptic
But I ain't got a clue
How to explain to you
The things that we go through
I know that you feel it too
You're in no more control than I
As I child I swore they'd fine the cure so that I wouldn't die
Same little child that you could call alone
Yet I gone back I can't sit in quiet for two minutes
The chatter on my mind is why I produce lyrics
From the coldest globe
The only show on the road
Never showing them the course of the flowing
Like the force that change the course
So we reaping and sewing
See the mind is the reason why we feel that we're loved
And if you troubling someone's loved ones
And go back into the ground
And some of the things produced by the mind
Might just stick around
It's part of living this life
I don't know what to say
Along the way many wrongs in this place
The things were better before
I ain't sure that they matter anymore
It's part of living this life
I don't know what to say
Along the way many wrongs in this place
The things were better before
I ain't sure that they matter anymore
Drug addicted politician
And they say there is no difference
Energy ain't created or destroyed if this changes form
Once we play the songs
The sound just travels on
The dark corners are the place
Where we look death in the faces
And we let it give us chase
But it always gets away
Dark corners are the place
When we running our alarms
And we cannot back it up
Death always catches up
As the needles plunge into the vein
My blood was exchange
For those underground
Afghan something was strange
They use to make the pain disappear
He had struggling with a sickness ever since 14
When he remembered the hand that touched him finally understood what it means
That made it worth pursuing his dreams
They had plans to start a family
With a wedding in June
He didn't know he was so conventional
Ran straight back to the same block where he use to cop it
When he hit straight fire
His whole body went into shock
His brains forget to tell the lungs that they needed to breathe
Now he's in the dark corners
When we hit them dark corners
And though this annoyed her
Whatever convention it was
Grow up with both parents
Nice house in the states
That something they did prosper
She ain't never missed a week
Everest school she was top of the class
Yet they demanded better
Went straight to Cambridge
But had strange dreams of justice and helping the poor
Maybe that's part of why she chose him
Didn't know what in her mind
Her parents wanted for her a nice young looking boy
So when they found that he was English
They were slightly annoyed
But when they found out he was addicted to drugs
Say they wouldn't come to the wedding
It was totally shameful
Michelle left the house in the storm
She never saw the truck before it ended her life
But they never got the chance in the end
We live on borrowed time
When dark corners come
When them dark corners come
The dark corners are the place
Where we look death in the faces
And we let it give us chase
But it always gets away
Dark corners are the place
When we running our alarms
And we cannot back it up
Death always catches up
The dark corners are the place
Where we look death in the faces
And we let it give us chase
But it always gets away
Dark corners are the place
When we running our alarms
And we cannot back it up
Death always catches up
But how well did he play with the cards that were dealt
In his life with himself
Triple the family coffins
Even his father was slightly jealous
Of what he accomplished
Products that can't resembles his age
Each time it was released
Should have seen him with a craze
But beneath all the shine and the sheen
When they throw back those release
All that come back is scrutiny
The scientist to offer the report disappeared
In which powerful grows
Power changes reality
Had a off leverage with the media only painted him as gold
But despite all the wealth and the things that he owned
He couldn't find comfort for his soul
All he could see is images of death reaching him
Victims of mercenaries that this government betrayed
The dark corners are the place
Where we look death in the faces
And we let it give us chase
But it always gets away
Dark corners are the place
When we running our alarms
And we cannot back it up
I got all my life to live
And I got so much love to give
I got all my life to live
And I got so much love to give
To pick my future before my future picks me
I don't seem to meet financial aid requirements
At home the vibes don't feel right
My moms separated from her spouse
I'm ready to get up on a scam trip
So he can head uptown and purchase me a rented car
Just make sure that it's black
Think that it is when it ISN'T
I reached my destiny and my goal
If everything goes well I'm in it to win it
Step into my house made of bricks
Bad enough gotta watch out for a SNAKE called JAKE
And watch the dough flow like water
To let my people know my mission went great
Rest in peace to my little brother Donnie Boy
You know I ain't forget you
I don't rehearse they don't come better than
You can't hold your own you fuck around and catch a HERNIA
My name itself bring more Heartbeats than Robert Townsend
I hurdle over rappers like a stallion
It doesn't take Rosie Perez to see my living COLOR
I rain over heads just like an UMBRELLA
So strong that baby's boosted and I'm FULLER
I leave skid marks on the concrete streets
Permanent scars as I sabotage
More heatwave than a do rag does to a CAESAR
Give a thermometer a temperature of jungle FEVER
I throw your whole rap on a coat rack kid and just hang it up
And get your ass kicked like a game of SOCCER
Skills are fatter than a grease spot
But now I peep on low and they have to stop
My vocals sound dynamic when placed on track
I'll make a rapper change his occupation
I wait for challengers to pick a day to beef
I straighten up those who be slacking up
In other words I'm not a film director
So don't come over here acting up
You know just who I AM
This ain't the DAMN Macho MAN Wrestling PROGRAM
Over here you get SLAMMED on the premises
I'm not the one to get played
This ain't the arcade
Pull over here and you'll find your fingers in the yellow page
You can't hang with the kid
And write this shit in your diary
All you got to do is just set it
Better yet act like you want it and see if you don't get it
I walk over rappers like doormats
Lyrics you pick are all simple
And all like swift to come out your face like a dam pimple
But just so you can't follow this
My rhymes penetrate to the skin just like a dermatologist
Best to head to the CLINIC
I don't talk past the speed LIMIT
One style's a GIMMICK
I won't change up because I'm not a SCHIZOPHRENIC
I kill a rapper's better one sec
If he ever play me like an accident and think he can catch wreck
In other words get that ass kicked
Play the back before you get smacked
Don't give a HELL who you wanna TELL
Not an intercom but my name rings BELLS
This right here's about a girl
You gotta leave you gotta leave you gotta leave YO
I'll make your head bloody red if you don't get out
Your ass gotta go if you don't got dough
I know you'd probably make a good mother miss
But I don't got no time to be bothered with no broke bitch
I want your ass to be ghost
You gotta leave you gotta leave you gotta leave check it
Kindly pack up your shit
But I won't do a date upstate
I just perform that old Mike Tyson play and cry out RAPE
So we can have some dough Hobbes
Girlfriend I got your bags packed
I got your bags packed
I got your bags packed
I got your bags packed
Get ready to put an end to that Cinderella book
Forget all the nights you spent
At the road cause that's you're bout to hit
I got your bags packed
I got your bags packed
I got your bags packed
I walk through the projects with stress in my hands
But I'll flip the style like half a brick
I turn shit over like a spatula
Lyrics are so hard they'll be Kevin Costner's bodyguard
Then a guy with long caps of crack to sell
Homicide police be looking for me from the way I be killing and shit
Rapping over slamming tracks
My hand's compared to a drug called crack
Because it don't take much to get your ass smacked
So you can save bullshit
Word is bond get your shoehorn
Because I got a style that fit
I kick more black ass than Jim KELLY
They give me mines from state to state
So now it's time to face up
But if you play your jaw like a sneaker yo it's bound to get laced up
Selling out it what ya CAUSED IT
Charlie Angel rapper make like Farah
And get rinsed down the FAUCET
So save your devilish tricks for eve if you don't know me from Adam
My lyrics are hotter than summer school
I won't scream or HOLLER
Because all they do is scream and speak in tongues
Burning up charts with the rhymes I spark
Cardiology is the word because it comes from the heart
I make Jason meet his doom
I hit him with the bass from the room that goes
Check my style right before you freestyle
To think that they can get with this
With all those dreams you fuck around and put Freddy out of business
I'm not Shadow Stephen so I cease to be just another Hollywood
Don't stand around and be another Dennis Leary asshole
You'll get chopped like vegetables
To get room to breathe even if it means knocking out your asthma
I done blew up the World Trade and Vietnam
I throw incinerators at rappers that talk garbage
My name's not summer so I don't sweat it
So don't front like you don't know what my name is
That's not my number one AMOS
You take my style and squeeze your lips
I dare another rapper try to TAME THIS
I hit you in the ANUS
All you motherfuckers best to breeze like the wind
Check the news forecast
If you're light in the ass
So don't try to take the winner's belt
With the sick shit I'm SAYING
I got more GAME than a panhandler on a TRAIN
You know the rules if you ain't ruff
Stay on the hush and get played like Sunday school shoes
I play you like a game of chess and keep your ass in check
Whenever you wanna get loose and hang out
Remember I done turned enough troops into The Last Boy Scout
Otherwise make like a librarian and keep your ass quiet
I'm out to catch the winner's cup
All you number one contenders just got knocked to the runner's up
Airports they amazed to me
This bad boy about to start to slack
Creating a mess on stage out of comedian rappers like Gallagher
My mind is filthier than a HAMPER
On top of that I've been through more shit than PAMPERS
All around the town on the down low was the girl that I was hitting
I don't want this pregnant talk to get back to my mother
I thought me and this lady had came to a mutual agreement
All along girlfriend I though you was still on the pill
You wanna play Biz Mark AGAIN
And tell him I'm just a FRIEND
All I do is think about you and child support
I ain't old enough and ain't trying to hear it
I'll give your ass a hanging and drop you off in an alleyway
This is a diary of a black man
By making no alimony payments due to no wedding bands
I'm ready to set her up and have my little man kick her in the stomach
Or punch my fist through that naval
Or push her down a flight of steps
I don't care or give a heck
About the people under the stairs
This ain't the damn Wheel of FORTUNE
I don't want no pause or no PORTION
Next time woman you should proceed with CAUTION
It ain't all about boy and girl
A half hour past the Cosby Show
Ain't even my style man
Bout to get the FUCK up out of this shit
I'm not the type of guy to run up and down and break out in a sweat
I just make the words sound hip
So long as my pockets stay in SHAPE
I never participated in gym
They say health brings you longevity
Won't see me on no field with no baseball bat
I just talk to girls on the horn
Another athlete bites the dust
I just cool around the block and hold down the fort
I wanna get out this relationship
But I'm scared that my man will flip
He always swears how he's gonna kill me
And fill me with the bullets from his clip
I met her in Queens her personality was erotic
Love at first sight as she was staring
Stonewashed pants ticked inside of some Timberlands
Her eyes just stayed on my face
All of the sudden let's take a WALK through the PARK
She probably thought I was trying to play her out
Like a Central Park jogger
But that's not my style that's what I'm telling ya
Give me your number and I'll probably call you up on my cellular
At night we spoke for hours and hours and hours and hours
Miss Astrologist because she looked like a star to me
Out on the streets dealing and sticking up
I try to make her look appealing
I went out and started tricking bucks
Now all of her friends can't wait to be next up
I need to get her thoughts fixed up
She caught me talking about a quits
But that's that old bullshit
Once you in there ain't no exit
I talk a good game of pain
Put it in your ear and let it rain
Once my voice touch your brain
So you can talk that fast slang dialect
Other words make you come correct
Think that to stop giving the loving
After one hit you're ready to split
You best to take the batteries out your watch if you want some time off
I write my name on your street curb
In case you wanna TRY ME
And break out on my ass like poison IVY
And prepare to go all out like New Year's Eve
I stack razor blades in my shoe
Locked down with men that go both ways
I'm not the everyday herb
You know the whole PHASE
I'm about to go through the government's MAZE
Best to fly the kid champagne from Spain
Me and my friends gonna get together
But now we just gonna party... party...
All my peeps know they got to keep they damn guns at the door
Bad enough I have to go in yo
This ain't The Wizard of Oz where I can tap my heels and go for it
You best to purchase a hearing aid and ask yourself how that sound
Politicians they all know dis
Yeah part of the government's plan
You get done in different ways
I'm headed for the cage
I didn't know what to do...
Without my baby baby baby baby
And then I met his best friend
And he took me to his house
And I said... I said...
She said put it in her mouth
She said put it in her mouth
You wanna go down why not
But don't give me no Ralph Lauren grin
Put your lips here and catch these damn facial hairs
Or you can just eat me out
Or I can just eat you out
Go down kinda slow or even fast
I'm always sprung once I feel your tongue in the
Boy you pack such a tasty treat
And you can e a t m e o u t
But put it in my mouth
And you could just eat me out
We want about 50 Thou and 4 Ki's
And maybe after that we just might breath
Leaving you cracking like Daffy with duct tape on your mouth
Leaving your ass tied up like pretzels
That's how I'm living
How else you think the money's supposed to come that's why
I extort as you get stuck for bucks
I drop it like an incinerator was the topic
I'll empty in your pockets
And leave your stomachs looking like the number 0
With the Tech 9 backing you up like spines
Taking your materialistic things like rings
With guns that bark to keep them from killing me
Ready to clap a stinking victim like a fucking applause
Even if you got condoms in your wallet
That don't mean your money's safe
So act like you not having it when I start grabbing it
Holding a Mac that I pimp like a mack
By putting one shell in your head like a rhino
Or I'll do to 2 to your head
Before I damn wanted to let you know that you ain't who's hot
My baby left me last night
And then I met his best friend
And he took me to his house
And I said... I said...
She said put it in her mouth
You wanna go down why not
And tell you that my name is AK
But don't give me no Ralph Loren grin
If your not down to go low deep in my mouth
For your chapped ass lips down in my mouth
With an erection like injections
Numbing up your tonsils
And catch these damn facial hairs in your mouth
Or you can just eat me out
Or I can just eat you out
Go down kinda slow or even fast
I'm always sprung once I feel your tongue
And you can e a t m e o u t
But put it you're my mouth
And you could just eat me out
What do ya choose to lick you could eat me out
Man it's your pick put it in my mouth
What do ya choose to lick put it in my mouth
People through out the world just put it in my mouth
What do you wanna lick and you could just eat me out
People through out the world put it in my mouth
It's your pick... pick let me go down
Right now we representing all the guys with more than ten dollars in
Yo if I ever had to go out spending cash for ass
I get it some Quarterback shit and I'll just pass.
I'm a little too fast for y'all gold diggers
I'm straight up like the collar on the foreigns
The fire run game on they brain
You cats is dying died her up in the Ramada
And all y'all girls can have a slice on me
Cause tonight me and my people we fucking for free
Imagine I would pay for all the girls I fucked
I'd be broke as fuck with a broken heart
Plus I can't fuck now what the fuck type of shit is that in this
But if you want me to go down south girl listen up
Yo it should be a crime
The way I murder these rhymes
I flip hundreds of lines
In niggers pussy like cat litter
Cause the raps I give
They running through your ass like a laxative Huh
Original incredible lyrical hook for years
But y'all wasn't trying to hear
I kick it loud and clear
Make you whisper like those motherfucking temptations is out
By the pier like pliers
Play them both sides of the fence like barbed wires
But I will make your whole entire empire retire
All you hear is repeated gun fire
Leaving your chest heated like clunky dryers
You couldn't get with me
Leave you in lakes like Ricky
Like a rapper who slammed his sister loose leaf paper
It don't get no better than this
I'm bad to the bone like skeletons
And plus I rock your dome without stones
Pack the certified chrome to make you think I'm Italian
From the way that I roam
And start looking for Miss Jones
I like rap superstars out of their twilight ass zone
What the hell you think it's the AK
Like I'm yelling it's my beat huh what
You could have a son or a daughter if you fuck me down
Cause pussy makes the world go round
Pussy makes the world go
Pussy makes the world go round round
Who in love with their wives
Lying between your thighs
Squinting his when he talk as if he was Chinese
She came upstairs bitching
Throwing hints when I'm walking by blowing kisses
He was like what shit skip the ripping
When I said started spitting
Motherfuckers who was down with him
Pull his dirty ass up
Then seeing the police
The adrenaline make them surrender start bagging them up
Living in prison started grabbing his nuts
Told the cops it's his dick that hey all could suck
He started backing them up
Like he clapping them up
Came from behind trees
Instead he loaded and cocked back
Turn his hat from his front to his back
Immediately he started stumbling back
Cause the swat team repeatedly laid his ass flat
As he laid on his back
Girl rushed to his side picked him up off the floor put him on her lap
Got blood on her dress
Of the bullet wounds left in his chest
She said uh uh don't go
As she stretched him out on the tar
But he just lay there stiff
And placed it about her heart on top of her breast
With blood this is for the love of her sex
I took him around and shit
I was going to fuck him
No I really was going to fuck him
I wanted to fuck him though
I was gonna give him some of this pussy
But he started talking some wild shit
Oh yes you will be licking my dick tonight
Oh no I motherfucking won't
I was laying in the bed
Like give me some head
When it coming out black uh uh you dead
I was looking at the chick like bitch ill
What the fuck the deal
If you don't begin at nil
You would add sex appeal
Oh yes you will be licking my dick tonight
I put my pants to my hips
I looked her in the grill
My kind of steady booker
I put my nuts by your chin so when you look up
You should have seen her whole face pushed up
She said huh what ill
I won't be doing that shit
Get your hands off my head
You get out of my face
I don't believe in that shit
I won't be sucking your dick tonight
You would swear that she want it
From the way you kissed my stomach
Imagine she doing it like she getting blunt it
You know French kiss and put the tongue on it
And then she stopped and I was like doggone it
Stop acting scared like my house haunted
Oh yes you will be licking my dick tonight
Do me and I'll do you
If we do it together we on some 69 shit
I know mad chicks act like they don't lick DICK
I won't be doing that shit
Ha to all my dick suckers in the house
This is straight up cunt language type shit
This right here is for all the girls
Who I used to talk to who didn't amount to be shit in life.
Their man on me when I was in front of the building
All the girls who gave me a wrong number
Remember when I used to push cars that was rented
One love to the late great Easy E
I can take the girl from the local streets
And take her to Cancun and fuck her on the beach
Yeah this for all the girls when I used to call they house
They see my number on the caller ID
And they never pick up the phone... fuck you...
Did that Spud dog ever fuck them three frog Bud
They had more than three
But if they cut a few
Stanford and Son fuck Esther Grady
Is it that old school chick
And them other two guys
And all you freaks on that motorcycle shit
I wonder would you ever fuck them two police from
Just imagine you could have
Though I love you like my brother
Yo girls be acting like they my sister
Talking about you can't buy them like your brother and shit
But we don't got the same father never suck on the same mother tits
So how you come to this
You told me about the guys you hit
You said I probably lied about the girls
In the world that I said I done hit
Cause it was the beginning
Even when you joked and said my wrinkled sweater reminded you of
Anyway ha ha ha ha ha
Had to find that funny
So I said yo bitch would you fuck me for money
Quick to call the kid up every time you broke
Girl don't get me wrong
I'm not no duck and shit
Before I make moves like that
I got to at least fuck and shit
In your butt and shit
Is every brother who got a artificial sister
This is your theme song
This is your theme song
Though I love you like my brother
Yo this song right here is dedicated to
All the girls who want to be some dude's sister
Without fucking that mother fucker
How do you feel now that you know you cheated on me
Was she as good goody goody good as can be
How do you feel knowing that I know
And how do you feel knowing that I cheated on you to
And did she get you open with a 69
Now did she do you well
Did she take it fast or did she take it slow
See my guy he did me and he did me well
He touched my tits and then my panties fell
I feel man dick go up inside of me
Now did she get you open with a second round
On the bed the chair or maybe on the ground
Was it as good as good as you though it'd be
Did the skinny amateur even compare to me
When my guy got finished with his love and flow
He showed me many many things that you didn't know
And by the time we reached found 44
It took his time laid me down and we made love some more
Ha now I didn't even mean to cheat on your pussy
I found another lady who said she'd fuck me for free
And I didn't even like have to eat her out
The first thing she put this dick up in her mouth
Now I'm not saying that I was loving the chick
Do get me wrong later on I'll probably be fucking the chick
Get on some Donald shit
Then start ducking the chick
Now the motherfucking moral of the story is
You cheat on me I'll cheat on you that's just how it is
My new sweetie she know I don't come speedy
Now what we do with me and you don't go tell he or she
Keep it to yourself like Monica Lewinsky
So we don't blow trial
When you creeping through
Cause all the bitches that cheat this song's for you
Right now this is Larry Love
Representing 35 above
Big up to all of south London
Big up to all the brothers
All the brothers representing hard core hip hop
We always come our with a warning
This is course hip hop
Who's this girl singing man
Yo we even got the queen up for ransom
That's how we do it in London town
Sky's the limit and you know that you
Could have what you want or be what you want
But make sure you live to be everything you say
And yo sky's the limit and you know that you
Could have what you want or be what you want
We never ran we never will
Because Sky's the limit and we take y'all
With my mind stuffed and messed around
Similar to guns and clips
I put you in that Puff
Daddy mode and keep your while motherfucking back bopping
But you could catch me maxing that movie about the dog
All I need is a pad and pencil in
Watch me throwing Adolph Hitler signs cause y'all cannot see
I run these streets like traffic police
Walking with irons so I can straighten out beef like a priest
Even without an automatic
Because I propel like choppers on top a helicopter
So tell me who the fuck know how to rock this right
And for lyricist of the year
How the fuck you ain't pronounce my damn name right
Have orgasms on top of flower pots
Got heavy metal locked
Just so I can watch you punks get rocked
As we walk all through you're city like damn messengers
So put me through a test like the tubes
As I step to the rhyme biters
In the name of the Father the Son the Holy Spirit
Send me a girl to love
A girl who love me for me
I see sexy ladies everyday
You no say which one I deals with today
Together me and you can experience American dream
Let's fly over the Titanic
And go to the Hispanic land
Where the beach exist only when you holding hands
Walking through the sand
Far from mighty Conga
Face down on the tongue
But I'm looking for a wife man
This is for all the girls I fucked before
I don't wants to deal with whores no more
All the girls who stood with me when I wore
Todays you rich yesterdays you was poor
I can't wait till one of us cums
Sex in the city me and you one on one
Let's see who'll be the first to make the other cum
Sex in the city me and you one on one
Let's see who'll be the first to make the other cum
I know you like the way I'm working my shit
I'll be that freak bitch put the mind on your dick
Lick a pussy push up I perfected my grip
Wish I don't take my pillow
Hope you go down below
I know you like shit like this
Ha turn your ass around now
Look at the pillow and bow down
Keep your feet flat on the ground
Now don't make a sound
I swear it won't hurt a bit
Once I insert the dick
It's your hair I pull
Start raising like rum
There ain't a girl in this world I can't fuck for
In the hole where she pee pee
Open up my ass cheeks and let her eat me
Better close your eyes or I'll make you come quick
I want some next shit when my friends take your dick
Fuck me fuck the rest of them
Shook your leg while you sleep
Ha put them up in the anal
Arch my back like a rainbow
She came fast I came slow
Y'all know how the game go
Bitch talk shit till she get hit by man dingo
Every time I think I'm single
I go out and fuck and mingle
I'm shooting the gift just like Kris Kringle
Make girls come like subpoenas
I'm like a A felon he just a misdemeanor
Taking hoes directly to the telly
Then I put her on they belly
Body to me to escape poverty
Before I started boning chicks
I used to watch the porno flicks
Every night I would fuck that same Yoko Ono chick
I guess I was just young sad and blue
The world made me like this
Girls very rare gave me a kiss
Pulling my dick out only to piss
Now the tables switched and turned
One girl give me all of them
I'll have a ball with them
And when we do change the numbers so they don't call again
We probably see them at the mall again
Or the dance hall again
Fuck it if they wit it we could do it all again
You're a true baller when
Now bring the chorus in
You know he's your ho
You know he's your ho
I don't want to be a ho like no more
You'll be dick sucking
My dick stuck in your back
Go fuck her then come fuck me
Well you're shit out of luck cause this bitch ain't free
And you want to come home pass diseases to me
Have me scratching my pussy like I'm looking for fleas
And you can't fuck me around
They said love is love
They said love is love
Do you really love me
Or is you just trying to set up to bug me
Ha I done mess with the baddest hoes
To the house music hoes
Don't matter how you feel about the mother G
Cause those girls ain't got shit on me
I got a grown woman's body you can plainly see
With a don't grow on the pubic hairs with me
But there's more to this than just pussy
With a giant ass cock
When I'm up in their crotch I get stuck like stop
When I'm in their bed box I make them hop like scotch
Make them scream for blocks and blocks
You don't go down low
You must really treat me to the foreskin
Not no prisoner for re type thing
In other words I won't be horsing around like mustang
We could get street like slang
Or I could eat you out till my lips is orange like tang
Ha It's like a bird's a bird and a duck is a duck
Similar to love is love and a fuck is a fuck
And don't get up like chubby checkers and get it twisted
I wonder do you swallow
Trying to find out today but you like any tomorrow
But tomorrow's just another day to wait
A real bitch like me needs foreplay
All the way from the gladdest nights to the mother's day
When it comes to sucking dicks yo I don't play A big sperm
Come off the top of your head like toupee
Trying to out do me in my perverted like flow
You should see the way we spread them legs
Cause that's the type of shit that I does
You I'm from New York
And this shit here should get all the thugs up
Anticipating the showdown
Then they stock just drop
So tell me who's pimping heartless
From Jacksonville to Charlotte
We coming back from some hype shit
Chilling with hook dogs
I'm blinding in the dinette set
And let the sunlight shine
Making vows to remain for ill and tight
Throughout all space and time
So from here to 19 ninety something
So I'm going to represent with my shit
With electric car wire
And calling out the frauds like we fucking on fire
Now most chicks get they back blown
When I let my act roll
Conference on a track phone
Joelle will pack chrome
All through your back zone
But will still aim at your black dome
We pressure in a trunk
But if you want to find me come around wisdom
How do I say this calmly
And if stripped to my wear
Only a few cats clear
On how I do that there
I wreck yous down like molecules
When I play them fools
With the ladies sneaking on the jewels
But my words are strong
Upstate South Cleve West Anderson
They expect it just the same
You didn't worry about no ride or no high priced gear
Wearing fake gold chain and no shirt is how we pimp
The north south east and the west
So you had to deal before dark
Smoking weed in the club
They don't dance they just just party
Drinking cold malt liquor
To make them asses move quicker
We dirty like floor mats
Ride in the sports coupes big jeeps fly
I go down south to bust a nut
I going to go flick it up
Out of town I know crackers with correct ID
In exchange for crack
And the south tackle that
To my New York money makers
Who smoke a lot and get high like sky scrapers
Down south I know girls who straight want to rape us
Everywhere we go mad love they show us
Even girls who don't know us
You don't have a fucking clue
You don't have a fucking clue
There ain't a man who can handle
Once I back slap you or clap you
Bullets in your skin like a tattoo
I get down for my clan till they call me your majesty
Wailing on your ass like Venice
All the above I've done the like Australia
I got ammunition for those dissing
I land one with the hand gun
You could go ask Charles and he'll tell you
You don't have a fucking clue
You don't have a fucking clue
My foot will lay you down to rest
And bless you with that Russell Simmons saint
And say thanks for coming out and God bless
I got hollow pistol leave you with the bullet infested in the chest
I keep the gun point cocked like fucking barbells
Who the hell want to touch this veteran
Bullet in your brain leave your head in pain
Now they don't have a clue and shit
Around the way I see your name written on the walls
Like rest in peace in you and shit
Your crew they ain't doing shit
Your mom's talking about the city had you suing it
You want to see God hit you with about seven
You want to see God hit you with about seven
You don't have a fucking clue
You don't have a fucking clue
You don't have a fucking clue
You don't have a fucking clue
Something is what you meet standing up on the corner
Here I am what I'm going to do
Yes I've got these dreams to come true
And the way you embrace me
It makes me want to crossover
I use your blood to paint the walls like period vagina
When we busting you up
Bullets like allergies
My guns part authority
I could feel or catch a wreck like your part buttons
Be clocking you and dropping you
My hobby is to hit you
With guns in the hand
Putting bullets in your chest
Wet you up like star water
Trying to go up again
To stab you with a dagger
Making your ass fall like Niagara
My trigger finger that damage
Similar to stop signs
And all you ever find
Is their body outlined
Is the Bronx up in here
Is Brooklyn up in here
I'd rather fuck you girl
Spread out spread out spread out
We tell them bitches to flee
Now we could start this shit up on the living room couch
At your mother's house
I think of different ways
So we could fuck fuck all through the night
I say fuck them bitches
That I used to mess with
They knew I should of knew when it comes to handling real dick
I like when it's mushy
And the sex is wet and gushy
I love it when you push me
When I'm humping up in your pussy
With my man complexion
I didn't know what to do...
Without my baby baby baby baby
And then I met his best friend
And he took me to his house
And I said... I said...
She said put it in her mouth
She said put it in her mouth
You wanna go down why not
But don't give me no Ralph Lauren grin
Put your lips here and catch these damn facial hairs
Or you can just eat me out
Or I can just eat you out
Go down kinda slow or even fast
I'm always sprung once I feel your tongue in the
Boy you pack such a tasty treat
And you can e a t m e o u t
But put it in my mouth
And you could just eat me out
But it don't mean no give a fuck
You know you could never give a
Then a bitch got it slapped
Don't try to be brave bitch
You be a dead bitch in the grave bitch
Break it off bitch you want the drama bitch
Hog bitch you come and stalk bitch
You got a lot of heart bitch
For you to me you ain't too smart bitch
Whether you're down with social security
A ain't nothing but an agenda
You better hold on to your changes
Don't think that it can't happen bitch
It's bad that bitches mostly get
Stabbed to death with they own knife
Todd skin bitches feel lack of blue
I think straight slang
Each and everyone of them bitch is get slapped
Martial arts bitches get me fat
Nobody's shit goes live
Some eyes in the third
Just like the class of the wedded
I'm member of the bitch haters club
Right now we representing all the guys with more than ten dollars in
Yo if I ever had to go out spending cash for ass
I get it some Quarterback shit and I'll just pass.
I'm a little too fast for y'all gold diggers
I'm straight up like the collar on the foreigns
The fire run game on they brain
You cats is dying died her up in the Ramada
And all y'all girls can have a slice on me
Cause tonight me and my people we fucking for free
Imagine I would pay for all the girls I fucked
I'd be broke as fuck with a broken heart
Plus I can't fuck now what the fuck type of shit is that in this
But if you want me to go down south girl listen up
Automatic Desert Eagle haunt me
As my voice skate on the board like Tony Hawk
I put rappers and singers in they place
Smack fire out ya ass
I got lyrics as soon as you hear it
I put rappers and singers in they place
Smack fire out ya ass
I'm big like Nell Carter
Slaughter throw ya body in the water
Make your Dame Dash like Shawn Carter
If you a gold or platinum artist
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
My troops roll up with a strange force
I was trapped in a cage and let out by the Main Source
Swimming in women like a lifeguard
Kidnap the President's wife without a plan
Before stepping to me you'd rather step to Jehovah
I move swift and uplift your mind
Fatal is merciful and they curse me
Brothers are live but I bet ya I'm liver son
So let me get upon the scene and redeem
An Asiatic brother that many rappers envy
So round up your crew and entourage
And let the God Merciful just take charge
Like pigs when it comes to a showdown
That's what separates me from the petty
And get torn the fuck up like confetti
Get you sucker if you bite like a piranha
The only future that lies ahead of them is the lights from the hearse
Knots in the head from the words that I said
So get a shovel and dig your grave cause the shit you talk is dead
I grab up girls like jacks
As far as brothers are concerned a pressure cooker from start
To finish I diminish like a Cuisinart
Don't talk about how you can break Rambo
Don't let the folks around your way puff your head
I'll kick fire out your ass so fast
Ask some kids around your neighborhood block
I be the wild cowboy got a lot of style
I be the wild cowboy got a lot of style
I be the wild cowboy got a lot of style
I be the wild cowboy got a lot of style boy
Like Mario Elli jumps out from the G line
Cause ever since the days of British Walkers
Wailing on your ass like like Parker
My style as sharp as a MACHETE
Shredding rappers like SPAGHETTI
Your crew better jump back in the oven
Hey life to me is no Popcorn Love
Better saddle up this year with two gloves
The Colonel's steamy chicken box
Big shout to the Flip Squad
You want beef I bring steak bust your motherfucking chop
X marks the spot when it's time to get hot
Boogie Down Bronx till we die yo
Slow it down one time for me God
I'm like a kid to birth control pills
The ready whenever to react
Guys you better recognize
So watch your back like Zorro
To burn punk rappers like some type of sick dick sperm
And insert cock in bitches crotches
I'm the hottest shit on the streets
Ever since the tar dried upon the pavement
Like a holocaust with no remorse
My slant mouth muzzle as I guzzle on a 40 ounce
And show you heaters that'll defrost your ice grill
The grown woman getter
It's all about cheddar
I make more cheese than mozzarella
I put my signatures on spatulas in case I gotta flip the script
Aimed at you... aimed at you...
It only take us but two minutes and some odd seconds
Heinous in places where the darkest spaces rot in wastes
And seen his man with the stove like the gnats off
Yo I know you can't smoke but come throw dice with me
Three guys mask over they eyes in full strides
Sold the shit to the pawn shop and some fat guy
For like 35 hundred and a knife he can run with
In the winter of his discontent
He was birthed like a verse from the gospel
Never heard any words to encourage out his mom's mouth
Knew his number better than himself as he peered down his cell
He observes but back to the curb to sound the white birds
Life seemed like mid summer night's dream
But his audience was the money machine's constant applause
Every clue got his Judas
The closest that he gets to guard the only bars he thought he'd be in
When you see them come around to evacuate a house
I feel like the whole world gone crazy
It reminds me of the days when we lived as slaves
Scores of people perched on top roofs
They were pointed in the air cause the bullets were flares
But regardless if the media cares or not
It defends us from criticism and hides our insecurities
And we wear this facade as a badge of pride so long
That we forget what's truly underneath
It's the points where we at our loneliest and darkest moments
Trials that you get through and tribulations that'll send you
Then again if we lived like we supposed to
My rhyme of reason cause a conflict
I gotta get but scared to use it cause my parents still riff
Until the day my words no longer convey
Until the day the music drives me insane
And those are the flows with no way to expose it though
Only had a little bit to hold on to
I want you to know that they don't want you
We direct what they teach in school
I make this music just to grind through it
I made this music just to grind through it
Maybe things all come back with no crazy shit like this
Now it's time for us to try to make it in this Matrix
Polish it until it's golden scripted to spit it gifted
Gotta know what glitters ain't gold
Breathe in the city lights till we exhale neon
Snaps back to dirty building to steel doors
Mingle we labeled in the Star Spangled
Close to a beach with sand
Kick back and pop a bottle till models in avocado strings
Been in love and daydream then roll like the villains and never play
I see the jobs and bills and it's hard to kill
Only to reason for the Four Seasons
To learn each other in a place where nobody can reach us
We'll take care of that later on
My flow is cancerous milk like Monsanto's
Capitalism's a religion that makes Satan a god
To cake to make your way in
Bear claw necklace and the puma moccasins
I'm the last of the Essenes that'll teach a messiah
When I scratch it's more than just an itch
You make your own blessings
Pass the benches in the park where the fiends use syringes
Stay away from snakes and them fake ass police
And all of this make it awkward without dollars to spit
Though three abortions supported by the source of her tricked dough
A dime chicken risk her position to get her finger froze
So she can go and buy her some clothes and do her hair
Stay tuned for the next album's installment
Additional episodes may cause consciousness
The ability to foresee capitalistic agenda
Brought to you in part by
A mother that strip tease on her knees for cheese to feed two seeds
I don't follow the news
They just add to my blues
Could never fill my shoes
We hit hard like still melons
Armies in the school line
What a powerful country
18 years old and your brain is like lunch meat
Programmed to follow these dummies
To the suburbs to the slum streets
Pull us over soon as they see blacks in the front seat
Me and mine is gonna be fine
Politicians that be gargling that garbage shit
Officers the opposite
Doctrines for illegal tended documents
When the cops rolled by
I gotta take it on the block again
As a child offender for indecent exposure
But the list had been restricted
A Lexus hit and I missed it
My brother joined the service
Not even nervous to get hit
They got Saddam ousted
For the pride in which they rob us
Every time that they stop us
He try to give us vouchers
To move us out the hood
I got a letter from my brother
Said the media confuse ya
No proper armor when they move us
Shiites is soon to surround us in Iraq
The shit is even getting more foul
Damn it's all relevant
It's never how they tell it is
So I gotta get my shit straight
The next time I have to go vote
Plus I heard there's a lot of jobs
No matter how far I go
And now they done stop me
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
As I sold the last bag
Fucked around and got locked up
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
Visitation no longer comes by
It seems like they forgot about me
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
Tell them I'm locked up
Let me tell you what hurts the most
I'm a convicted felon and I can't work
No matter where I go and try to get paid
Rob the manager and everybody in it
That's the everyday life of a convict
The judges said don't trouble nobody
Probation said don't trouble nobody
Cause this the type of shit that we go through
Up in the ghetto just to make some cheese
Take it from the profit of the weed
I witness one too many killings
I'm trying to stay away from trouble everyday
But its hard when the things you need
When they hungry and they need to eat
But they won't let me do right
Even tho I done changed my life
My mama said don't trouble nobody
My papa said don't trouble nobody
The judge said don't trouble nobody
Probation said don't trouble nobody
My mama said don't trouble nobody
My Papa said don't trouble nobody
Hey ladies drop it down
Just want to see you touch the ground
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies drop it down
Just want to see you touch the ground
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Do you have any idea what you starting girl
Little touch is a ditty
Love to work the kitty like purr
I can hear her purring up
What's the man without the plan B
While I watch this beautiful thing shake that ass
Hey ladies drop it down
Just want to see you touch the ground
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies drop it down
Just want to see you touch the ground
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Girl you could do anything you want in here
You ain't even gotta drop down if you want to
Lap dancing for my FA crew
Hey ladies drop it down
Just want to see you touch the ground
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies drop it down
Just want to see you touch the ground
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Girl shake ya body body
Whatever you do don't break your body body
After the party party
Jiggle it to the front then jiggle it to the back
Hey ladies drop it down
Just want to see you touch the ground
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies drop it down
Just want to see you touch the ground
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies drop it down
Just want to see you touch the ground
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies drop it down

Steady claiming like they a pimp
Still in the projects
Yeah show them the ropes
Any one step in the way will get chock
I see you just by flashing
Look what you gone made Iceberg do
After she burn me out fucking up your face hoe
So I look at the next man like step up bitch
Cuss if it's going down
Survive in the streets
Living life fore this shit
Eat a dick and die slow
And there's no one to hold on too
And there's no one to pull you out
So you end up self destructing
Dark memories of when there was no sunshine
That's the life when you're
Even the life that you have is borrowed
Once you move forward can't go back
Best prepare to remove your past
Whoever said that this struggle would stop today
Teenage women growing up with aids
That's the life when you're
So let the history be too
You see we all out here
How can we work it out
On that day when it's time to share the gold at the end of the rainbow
How can we work it out
When good and evil be
The day you kiss this fate
You gotta be strong and do what you feel in your heart
I know it might seem bold
But you know to what we never had
How can we work it out
On that day when it's time to share the gold at the end of the rainbow
When good and evil be
The day you kiss this fate
How can we work it out
How can we work it out
When good and evil be
The day you kiss this fate
How can we work it out
How can we work it out
When good and evil be
The day you kiss this fate
How can we work it out
How can we work it out
When good and evil be
The day you kiss this fate
I'm sure that the streets are watching me
Rather not run when the cops are stopping me
Pulled over on the road they watching me
Ferrari truck on the side of the road
Cause you can tell by the jewels that I ain't an average Joe
It's all good but I'm still in the hood
Ain't a damn thing changed
It's funny how people switch when they get rich
Spend it all on chicks
Ten million dollar crib for what
Five thousand dollar suits for what
Should of known but they only out for your riches
Some freaks need to be dealt with
I guarantee she'll do what you say
I have nobody for my own
I have nobody for my own
That's always been there
Like took all the bullshit
Then one day she can't take it no more and decide to leave
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Backtracking over these few years
My whole life came crashing and I'm so...
Can't believe I had a girl like you
After all I put you through
You still stuck around and stayed by my side
What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby you're a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
That can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come where you'd get up and run
And I would be out chasing you
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely...
I just want you to call my phone
Baby girl I didn't mean to shout
Don't make me call the police
It's a crime the way you bend them knees
Ain't nothing but money to me
Knowing that she's gonna come back
As if she's up on my reindeer
You know that she'll never wanna come back
So I add her to my hall of fame here
I'd like to come over and get to know ya
When I walk in the club with all the ladies so fly
Gotta work that body so beautifully make you wanna cry
Switch it over let me bust all over your anatomy
I'd like to come over and get to know ya
I can tell by the way you act so hard you like my type of nigger
Better bang in the back of the jeep and put a puncture in your liver
Better get romantic with ya make love to ya by the river
I'm wit the wine glass to go with your fine ass
I could make that shine last if I make you mine fast
Your the type I go all out to put you onto my staff
Let me be your teacher baby girl cause you in the wrong class
I'd like to come over and get to know ya
This is the ultimate journey of your life
Where the weak die and the strong survive
Prepare to suffer 40 days and 40 nights
Strap on your boots because you got a long hike
To make the story short that's why I'm here today
And about that day you kicked me out onto the bricks
What about that time you said I wouldn't make a dime
And about that time you said I couldn't make you mine
Destination to the bank overseas
Born and raised in Africa trying to make a scene
The best way to get to you is by this music thing
Lets take it to the streets
I traveled through the ghettos of America
Lets take it to the streets
I traveled through the ghettos of Africa
Lets take it to the streets
I traveled through the ghettos of Asia
Lets take it to the streets
I traveled through the ghettos all over
Baby dad is no where to be found
While you play the role of mom and poppy
Always home and can't go out now can't remember the last time you were happy
Girl I know that you can't hurt no more you've been damaged can't trust nobody
No matter how bad things get
Girl don't let it get to you
So girl don't let it get to you
Ya only got one life to live
So don't let it get to you
And just don't let it get to you
I noticed a couple items missing
See I done beat those cases
Dead time for the miscellaneous
And they proceed to keep on watching
I Wont let you lock me down
I Wont Let you stop me now
I Wont let you ruin my day
I won't let you stop my pain
And that's how I got this far
Can't believe I been through half the things that I went through
I won't let you lock me down
I won't let you stop me now
I won't let you ruin my day
I won't let you stop my pain
I won't let you lock me down
I won't let you stop me now
I won't let you ruin my day
I won't let you stop my pain
Now I'm headed to the county
No matter how far I go
And as I sold the last bag fucked around and got locked up
Now that I'm locked up I rep two sets so
Whoever wanted with P
Got a family that loves me
And wants me to do right
But instead I get locked up
Had to make good with crooked ass cops
Things getting hard but we still grinding up
Still don't came up and cops cribs by the river
Men we imported export keys
Before the feds came down on we
True bad man no counterfeit g's
Now I'm headed to the county
No matter how far I go
And as I sold the last bag fucked around and got locked up
Now that I'm locked up I rep two sets so
Whoever wanted with P
Got a family that loves me
And wants me to do right
But instead I get locked up
Hey ladies drop it down

Trough so you can live the way you live now
Say what you know about seeing that brand new mother
Giving away her newborn child
For the war to get on their side
So what you know about what comes first in their lives
Everything that we do is for our love
So what you know about that holy place called tuba were
See that's just a little piece of what we can do
Yo I think we got one on this one
Let them keep on calling.
As you want... keep on calling.
And all along I'm sitting there thinking it's harder when you
And I ain't got far to go
Seem to catch up to her
By the time I got there she was gone
And so I walked upstairs and I heard this sound
So I locked myself inside and closed the door
But there was this funny feeling inside
All alone with my ears pressed against the wall
Alone with my ears pressed against the wall
The more she play the more I feel the pain
I can't see her but I hear her from the shades
And it seems like she really knows me
Every fiddle makes me wanna run away
All alone with my ears pressed against the wall
Always around when you call
Always around leave the fun
So please stay in your place
Hate to find you with no face
Better yet gone with no trace
Other words please don't start no beef
Now sip on your Chardonnay
If the girls tipsy then fade away
I can tell that you wanna play
From here it's back to the block
Always around when you call
Always around leave the fun
Always around when you call
Always around leave the fun
Always around when you call
Always around leave the fun
You're an alcoholic red nose reindeer like Rudolph
I'm here to tear the roof off
Your head before you reach for the pistol
Good as me in the club popping bubbly
I can't complain life is lovely
Either you hate me or you love me
Fans wanna know when the Nuts is gonna come next
It doesn't matter competition is no contest
Clap your hands to the beat and get your bounce on
Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuff
Bother nobody less you fucking with us
You can bring it to us however you want
Especially the shorty with that big butt
And I don't care less about women and glamor
Or which one of you rappers is lifting his hammer
Trying to get rich without guns and the scanner
That's A to the K with a fucking bandanna
Spit like the shit on my teeth is barbwire
Make your girl suck cock till her knees are on fire
This one right here is gonna blow your brains
If you in the club you better hold your chain
Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuff
Bother nobody less you fucking with us
You can bring it to us however you want
Especially the shorty with that big butt
Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuffs
Bother nobody less you fucking with us
You can bring it to us however you want
Especially the shorty with that big butt
Up front is in the building
It's the convict album
Y'all done fucked up now
If you got it on ya block
From a key to a half a pound
Ya know me I'm known to rock wit it
Roll through your spot wit it
Hey ya know me I'm on the block with it
Violate and get popped wit it
Cause you will rarely find me
Without my weapon on me
And now the dots around the world
Do I make myself clear
A fleet of European cars in my driveway
And won't hesitate to cock it
When them people on me
Ya know I got that African connection
Locked up in a facility correction
Do I make myself clear
He'll show ya how to shake this down
Best believe it's no sweat
I give you that credibility for the right check
Keep your future on the shelf
Quiet where it's best kept
Don't want them upfront shooters
Do I make myself clear
It's one of those things man
We in too deep to turn back now D
You know where I come from
A jail cell a pine box
And brothers is dumb young
But 9 out of 10 of us ain't got good luck
Or get hit and get sent to the other side
You lose both sides of the coin
So me I play the hood baby
Mama got a little church I could join
Man got a mosque I could join
Cool with the devil on my back
In some dirty black old sweats
If you ain't man enough to make shit clear
Guaranteed you'll get blown away
And I done seen the cops break my peers
See I ain't never shot nobody
You'll think you been struck by lightning
Retaliation only takes anger mixed with passion
So when you're hit man
You feel that shit the evils do
Can't see myself get beat down
If I ain't got my heat then I got a blade
If you ain't man enough to make shit clear
Guaranteed you'll get blown away
And I done seen the cops break my peers
Other eye out for snakes
And these scandalous freaks
If we ain't on good terms
Don't bother to speak
Hate for it to be the world's sacrifice
If somebody else could travel
Through the tunnel of life
But I'll stay to myself
So if you see me out there
If you ain't man enough to make shit clear
Guaranteed you'll get blown away
And I done seen the cops break my peers
Could she be that lady
And possibly bend you over
Convicts got the whole thing packed down
And possibly bend you over
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
And possibly bend you over
And possibly bend you over
And you know we up front
I'm stuck on pussy and yours is right
Shorty I can see you ain't lonely
Just another tease far as I can see
And you know my pedigree
And besides I got a thing for you
Right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy
But I got a thing for you
The pressure's building up
How in the fuck am I gonna back my first album up
It'll never be the same
Nobody knew me than everybody knows my name
And I feel so ashamed
Everyday is just the same thing
Now it's been months out on the road
And I just wanna know
I let this shit get the best of me
And now I gotta let you know
It's hitting my window pane
And now I gotta let you know
Of the thunder that's crashing down
Now I got no more worries now
My pocket's fatter now
Look in the mirror my reflections looks different now
I can't escape the Rain
Now it's been months out on the road
And now I gotta let you know
I let this shit get the best of me
And now I gotta let you know
It's hitting my window pain
That's why I gotta let you know
Of the thunder that's crashing down
A moment ago it seemed
You were here with me
And everything seems to be the same
What am I supposed to do
You never took the time to know me
You never took the time to understand
You never took the time to know me
This wasn't what I wanted to be
Girl I look back a thousand times
Why can't you understand my pain
I can't believe that your love is gone
Said you never took the time to know me
So tell me can you feel it
Senegal can you feel it
So much love to share
So much love to share
This is for all the love
And the life took away
Don't forget we were born in trade
Ripped from the land and shipped away
Is the inspiration we used to survive
Have to see it with your own cries
Add it up and alright
Land is so gold and green
The place is so fresh and clean
And everyday I water my garden
Tell if you feel it deep in your heart and
The space is so cool and nice
And if you just believe in the most high
I know you'll be alright
So much love to share
So much love to share
That's my favorite place when I need to get away
Must forget but we can't forget to pray
Hear me chant Africa unite
Gonna accept the mass alright
Skin is so dark and brown
She lifts me right off the ground
So yo just listen up and believe me
Her trees have the only cure
Her love is so blue and pure
Had to kiss them troubles goodbye bye
So much love to share
So much love to share
So tell me can you feel it
Senegal can you feel it
So much love to share
Don't miss don't miss one moment about it
So much love to share
Resist this bliss yo I really doubt it
So much love to share
That's the way that it's gonna be
I'm in love with you and you in love with me.
Go outside and take a walk for a minute.
Together forever however just you and me.
That's the way that it's gonna be
I'm in love with you and you're in love with me.
Go outside and take a walk for a minute.
Go outside and take a walk for a minute.
Paramedics drive back slow... to the hospital
You get pronounced dead at 4... to the hospital
Now a days you can't find a good connect
But if you do you might be the feds so...
You don't know the history I got on these streets
Only if you seen what my eyes have seen
Then you'll understand why I'm surrounded by G's
If you owe me or we got beef I recommend you reach for your heat and don't freeze
You want short skirts
You don't know the history I got on these streets
Only if you seen what my eyes have seen
Then you'll understand why I'm surrounded by G's
If you owe me or we got beef I recommend you reach for your heat and don't freeze
Sidewalk got ears the pavement don't sleep
The fittest will survive the weak just don't eat
Sidewalk got ears the pavement don't sleep
The fittest will survive the weak just don't eat
I see my pain in your eyes man
It's that twinkle man
That sign of struggle
Cause everyday I can't help but see it
People ain't satisfied
And Everybody wanna live another life
But ain't no length you go or mountain you climb
Not to better your days
All That would do is leave room for people to say
Still I can't enjoy my fame
And I can see that you don't ever wanna struggle no more
And I can see that you don't ever wanna cry no more
It shouldn't have to be that way
You shouldn't have to pay my way
I shouldn't have to want for a brighter day
Got a little little problem on the way
Child support lady on your case
Not to mention tickets you ain't never paid
God please hold it down for me
Don't let Satan get the hold of me
But it happened a lot worse to my brother
Muhammad thank God he recovered
And I can see that you never wanna struggle no more
And I can see that you don't ever wanna cry no more
I can feel you strain now
We're no longer the same now
But you got to make change now
And I can see that you don't ever struggle no more
And I can see that you don't ever wanna cry no more
Don't wanna cry no more
That you don't ever want to struggle no more
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody thought we'd last forever
And don't wanna respect boundaries
Just to get on your side
But I must admit there was a couple secrets
But just know that I tried
To keep you satisfied
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody wanna see us together
Got every right to wanna leave
Got every right to wanna go
Got every right to hit the road
And never talk to me no more
You don't even have to call
Even check for me at all
Has been off the wall
Especially towards you
And they won't show you
How much of a queen you are to me
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody wanna see us together
As life goes on I'm starting to learn more and more about responsibility
And I realize that everything I do is affecting the people around me
So I want to take this time out to apologize for things that
I've done things that haven't occurred yet
And things that they don't want to take responsibility for
I'm sorry for the times that I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know
That you were sitting home just wishing we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect
I'm sorry for the times I disrespect
I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there
Because I'm in the streets like everyday
I'm sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl
I understand that there's some problems
And I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain
And you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
I'm sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do
I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags
Just trying to stay busy until you heard from dad
When you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though pops treated us like kings
He got a second wife and you didn't agree
He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a thief
I'm sorry that I grew up way to fast
I wish I would of listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry that your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the feds came and took me away
I understand that there's some problems
And I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain
And you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to see
But they were dead wrong trying to put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
And for the embarrassment that she felt
She's just a little young girl trying to have fun
But daddy should have never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage
In a 21 and older club they say
Why doesn't anybody want to take blame
I'm just a singer trying to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
Where cash moneys the only answer to problems around
I've been writing you this letter
I wanna say boy that I love you so
Even though they try to tell me forget about you
And baby ill wait ten thousand days
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no

Gotta get my block sold up... u know me
Gotta get my block sold up... u know me
I heard you wan some marijuana
Or some pure white coca
See I never been a smoker
See I woke up early as hell one morning
And I noticed my stash was half gone
Fighting for territory that's mine
I got dubs at the price of a dime
That's why I'm on top and I won't stop
I heard you wan some marijuana
Or some pure white coca
See I never been a smoker
You can find me on the other side of the border
Where the 100 grand in my pocket
Whatever it take to get to the crib
See I got so much client ale waiting
I can't just make one trip
But I gotta get enough to supply the sibling
Vaseline rapped around so it hide the sent
I heard you wan some marijuana
Or some pure white coca
See I never been a smoker
Face a trouble everyday
Trying to walk away from a life of sorrow
It's a struggle everyday
I need to take it slow
My heart is growing cold
I'm trying to hide my feelings
From the people that I know
And everywhere I go I'm trying to lay low
Can't afford to get in no trouble because I'm on parole
I'm trying to live life right
God knows with all my might
But I'm just barely getting by
And I can say this right
The struggle and the fight
Making me feel like there is no other way
But the different streets get that dough
Face a trouble everyday
Trying to walk away from a life of sorrow
It's a struggle everyday
Don't need feds all upon it
I done left that life alone
And then my conscience told me
Always complaining after I ain't never did
She always lonely. So what am I to do
Then I gotta deal with her attitude
It's making me feel like there is no other way
But the different streets get that dough
Face a trouble everyday
Trying to walk away from a life of sorrow
It's a struggle everyday
So let me go and put the bullshit beside and tell you like this
So let me live my life
So just live your life
We'll get back together if it's meant to be
Said you loved me way too much to be friends
Feel like you ain't never gave me a fair chance
All and all I loved the experience
In the future call forth we'll be back together again
So let me live my life
It's better the life for the one you want me to be
So just live your life
We'll get back together if it's meant to be
If you believe that I got one and back won't let me live
Can you believe that I got small problems that seems so big
See I'll always love you baby
Even though you drove me crazy
That's why I won't shed a tear
Best believe I'll be right here
So let me live my life
So just live your life
We'll get back together if it's meant to be
See I'll always love you baby
Even though you drove me crazy
I'll always keep you close
We're no longer happy here
That's why I won't shed a tear
Even though you would rather be with me
City lights came on and then went off again and your still alone
City lights came on and then went off again and your still alone
And when your on your feet you go right back yeah...
City lights came on and then went off again and your still alone
City lights came on and then went off again and your still alone
But you wanna hug me up until a brother can't breath
Like what do you want from me
Say you wanna love me but your man's in the way
Still what do you want from me
City lights came on and then went off again and your still alone
City lights came on and then went off again and your still alone
City lights came on and then went off again and your still alone
That I haven't seen your face
But the strength I have is washing away
It won't be long before I get you by my side
What's been on my mind
And we show our selfs that night even said somethings weren't true
Why can it be the way it was
Watching everyday that goes by
You are the apple of my eye
Watching everyday that goes by
You are the apple of my eye
I want you to fly with me
I miss how you lie with me
I wish you could dine with me
Wish you could dine with me
One that would grind with me
One that would grind with me
I want you to fly with me
I miss how you lie with me
I wish you could dine with me
One that would grind with me
Girl I don't wanna bother you

And I never wanna tell a lie lie lie

Doing exactly what I taught you
Gotta get that money first before you
Come spend that precious time with your boo
Even You was driving me crazy
Wish I can keep you much longer
Wish I can keep you much longer
Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
Partying so hard the ladies don't want it to end
Baby I'm a troublemaker
I'm that type of guy you won't cuff
I'm that type of guy that will save ya
I'm that type that will call you later
Won't be around to give you that time
Gotta get on the grind and get to that paper
Gotta keep my baby girl laced up in the latest and the fliest suits
Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
Baby I'm a troublemaker
See I'm that type guy that likes kissing
I'm that type that will pop the clip and
I'm that type of guy that put you in your place
I'm that type that will let you go
I'm that type that will let you know
But there ain't too many know how to get that dough
That's the type of girl I want around me
Look like something you would see on TV
She don't mind climbing up that ladder
But this time they wanna see us together
Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
Baby I'm a troublemaker
Even though I wanna take you everywhere I go
And I realize being with you girl bring more girls
And that's just what I'm attracted to
And I'd rather go all the way
I won't ever let her leave my bed
Till she sees the colorful feather like Annie Mae
Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
See I met her at club on the Friday
Seeing her coming my way
I didn't see a ring on her finger
I asked her have you ever been with a singer before
So let me introduce you to my world
Big diamonds and pearls all of part of being my girl
Bet you ain't never seen before
I got them coming back for more
And that's when I noticed
The way I am touching your body
Makes me want to keep grinding
See I bet you're nasty
When you're on the dance floor
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control
Got shorty right where I want her
Baby more better than ammonia
She said she wants to bring me to bring me to her world
She whispers some words
That damn near made my toes curl
She said she's got that
That I have never seen before
And if I get the taste
I'll be coming right back for more
And that's when I noticed
The way I am touching your body
Makes me want to keep grinding
See I bet you're nasty
When you're on the dance floor
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control
I'm working your body
Like you are in my bedroom
Everybody in the club got a clear view
But that won't stop us
The way I am touching your body
Makes me want to keep grinding
See I bet you're nasty
When you're on the dance floor
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control
I get it in till the sunrise
I see police on the crooked I
Doing a 100 on the Interstate 95
Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
I'm a sniper sitting on the roof already saw y'all
It ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
I rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Then let them haters come and make the name of me
I get it in till the sunrise
I am the boss it only takes one call
For a driver to hit you up and drop you off that's all
Guess what I won't be taking that fall
I get it in till the sunrise
How do I feel bitch I feel undefeated
Snap my fingers disappear from the precinct
Ball till we fall until the ball bounce
Only to find out you live in a doll house
But I thought you was tough though
We carry choppers on our necks
Weed smoke to gun smoke
I get it in till the sunrise
So many girls outside
And I wanna go take a cruise
The way you roll them thighs
I can set it up she can get it too
And we all got that bank so believe we can afford it
He just a roll of penny's I'm a stack of dollars
Got all these gorilla's and all these women here
So soft... and smooth...
Never knew a girl could be so god damn cold
If you would've seen what I've seen on that pole
But I just went against the grain
And it felt like harmony
Don't want that you ever go away
I want you around me everyday
That bubble in her pants got me caught up
It feels so good had me sprung out on that stuff
But I just went against the grain
And it felt like harmony
Don't want that you ever go away
I want you around me everyday
So thick... so rough...
That oil all over her body stole my heart
The way she drop down wont allow me to close my jaws
Already in love and I knew better from the start
But I just went against the grain
And it felt like harmony
Don't want that you ever go away
I want it around me everyday
And it felt like harmony
Don't want that you ever go away
I want it around me everyday
And I'm a always be there for you
And that's what gets me closer to you
Can never measure up to half of what I put you through
That's why we'll break through
And I don't care what they say
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
And I don't care what they do
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
Want to be the one that give you the whole enchilada
You ain't got to match with the shoes
All about knowing you I'm into doing things to keep her longer
Can never measure up to half of what I put you through
That's why we'll break through
And I don't care what they say
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
And I don't care what they do
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
You are everything in my life see the joy you bring
And ain't no one I compare you to
And I know that you will never walk away from me no matter what
And that's why I plan to do the same thing for you
And I want you to know
And I don't care what they say
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
And I don't care what they do
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
And I don't care what they say
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
And I don't care what they do
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
Who'd ever thought that I would see this day...
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Block don't stop always stayed hot...
No matter how the seasons got...
I still remember when they took me away...
Den I took the time to explore a better way...
Who'd ever thought that I would see this day...
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
And now I look forward to every day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
On my way to my holy place to pray...
Give thanks for every blessing given to me...
I know there's more to see... more to me... no more living in misery...
Who'd ever thought that I would see this day...
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
And now I look forward to every day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
I made the mark on February 1st
Between me and you you can call it birth
The beginning of our universe
I know that it was my fault
I know that I got caught
So please don't lose your thoughts
Of me loving you and you loving me
I'm on the highway swerving
Looking at the calendar getting nervous
Just a few more days to the first soul
This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds me of you
So let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began
To that point which is days apart
That stamp right next to your heart
Thinking back I ain't seen you in ages
Brings me back right back to the same mess
I know that it was my fault
I know that I got caught
So please don't lose your thoughts
Of me loving you and you loving me
I'm on the highway swerving
Looking at the calendar getting nervous
Just a few more days to the first soul
This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds me of you
So let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began
To that point which is days apart
That stamp right next to your heart
January February March April May
June July august is just another day
In December to mark my calendar to meet again
If only we can go to that place where me and you know
There's no faith fronting cheating even lying
The time has come where we stand face to face
This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds me of you
So let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began
To that point which is days apart
That stamp right next to your heart
That stamp right next to your heart
I am here at the crossroad
Where my life is heading man I don't know.
What I would give to get a sign from up above
I wish someone could pull me out of the mud
My life seems to be headed
I see things that would make another man cry
I'm sitting wondering why
I can't find that someone to fit in my life
And will they ever think I'm good enough for them
The blessing came when I needed it the most
And that is the sign I received from above
And that she was that something that pulled me out of the mud
And also the one who said to me
My life seems to be headed
No matter no matter how far you fall
You gotta you gotta be ready to stand up
I've been through the same things you're going through now
All my mistakes man you already know
Thanks to Catherine Dana
For giving my pops his glory
He came down with his drum
And a dream to change the world
In a free uplifting world
And that's all he ever want
Mom came a little after
Gave birth to my brother
Then all of the pressure
Did the best with what they had
He knew the world was out for grabs
And he searched to find his
As a kid I never knew
I'd have to hustle just to make it through
So I found myself skipping school
And because of that I didn't care
Whether or not I went to jail
I just wanna be treated fair
Cause that's all I ever knew
Cause everybody in the whole town
Foreigner from another town
After so many hit the ground
Won't stop till I find
All my mistakes girl you already know
I'm like a bird and I am so high
Day I stop will be the day I turn cold
And Let go so I can be free to do what means most to me
And You can look back one day and know I shared with you my kid
I hope you wouldn't think I'd just leave
Pack up and roll up my sleeve
Give it all up and leave you nothing and take with me all I got to give
I just wanna make you clap again
I just wanna make you clap again
So if your life is twisted and ain't going right
Just forget about it tonight
I just wanna make you happy baby
I'm the one to make it happen baby
So you can be free to do what was meant to be
And You look back one day and know I shared with you my gift
Hope you wouldn't think I'd just leave pack up and roll up my sleeve
Give it all up and leave you nothing and take with me all I got to give
I just wanna make you clap again
I just wanna make you clap again
I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when I say she got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when I say she got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
And she's high in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
It seems to me so unnatural
What seemed to be so incredible
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when I say she got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when I say she got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
And she's high in the sky singing
Absolutely can't lose no way
200 percent I am on my job
Ready for tomorrow if it ain't too late
Ain't thinking about the law
And a couple stacks stashed up in your top drawers
Not to mention them crooked cops
Pull you over when you drop
Pocket all your dough
Absolutely can't lose no way
200 percent I am on my job
Ready for tomorrow if it ain't too late
I refuse to lose in any game I choose to play
Absolutely can't lose no way
200 percent I am on my job
Ready for tomorrow if it ain't too late
Don't want it to become a habit
I've been living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Son needs some joy and
And the band recording
Trying to dodge the pen
Hoping I survive the morning
Man I'm talking scourging
Trying to make a fortune
Trying to skip my fork and
Then you gotta put your work in
Don't want it to become a habit
I've been living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
... Instead of calling
Smoked and my eyes blurred
Titanium shine on the road
Never touch me before you jerk yourself
You ain't got to help me
I don't know what to do
Well tell them I'm the mob
I'll take the sugar sharks
They can't breathe out the water
I'll tear your ass apart and put you out of order
Don't want it to become a habit
I've been living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
I see you every damn day and I can't help wondering why
He ain't giving you attention
What he's doing with a girl like you
You're too fine to be looking so blue
I can see that he ain't been hitting that at night
One ride with me would change your life
He ain't giving you attention
What he's doing with a girl like you
You're too fine to be looking so blue
That knows what your life comes through
Every time it ain't acting as it should
He ain't giving you attention
What he's doing with a girl like you
You're too fine to be looking so blue
Too fine to be looking so blue
Too fine to be looking so blue
How he ended with a girl like you
We could go out the back
If you're looking for her
She looking for me to let me love her.
Before I take you home
You gotta take it low
Then I'll lay you down
Like your favorite song
Before I take you home
You gotta take it low
Watch her breaking down
And money on their mind
Money money on their mind
And my presidents is going in the air when she winds on my
Give her a money then she'll go
Watch how many rags I blow
They say this look is best for my kidneys
Baby seasons change but people don't
And I'm always there waiting in the back rooms
Boring but overcompensate
But don't pretend you ever forget about me
Don't pretend you ever forget about me
Wouldn't you rather be a widow
Style your wake for fashion in magazines
They say your head can be a prison
Then these are just conjugal visits
So don't pretend you ever forget about me
I said now don't pretend you ever forget about me
Now wouldn't you rather be a widow
Style your wake for fashion in magazines
With smiles on our faces
We're dropped and well concealed
With smiles on our faces
We're dropped and well concealed
With smiles on our faces
We're dropped and well concealed
With smiles on our faces
We're dropped and well concealed
Like 50 cent I wanna get to know you
Then you'll realize this is how we do
I just wanna make you clap again
I just wanna make you clap again
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's gone much too long
Any time she goes away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Gotta leave the young thing alone
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's gone much too long
Any time she goes away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
I wonder if she's gone to stay
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't a home
Any time she goes away
Any time she goes away
Gotta leave the young thing alone
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
I wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Any time she goes away
I have nobody for my own
I have nobody for my own
Then one day she can't take it no more and decided to leave
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
So I had to take a little ride
Back tracking on these few years
Can't believe I had a girl like you
Around and stayed by my side
You were good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
That can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come where you'd get up and run
And I would be out chasing you
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Then the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely
Never thought that I would be alone
I didn't think you'd be gone this long
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playing girl and come on home

Only you if knew how my squad get down
You ain't met a bad man till you walked up on me

Yo yo between you and i

Go against my rule get a slug in your naval
Even my brother can get it true like can enable
Times are hard and the rich still do
Hoes ain't a friend to me they're just my enemy
So I pistol whip them dudes the blunt trauma
Rule 73 keep your gun oily clean

You ain't met a bad man till you walked up on me
And I'm a always be their for you
And that's what gets me closer to you

And now she shake that
Ass every time I walk by

Feeling like a big dog
Feeling like a big dog
Feeling like a big dog
Everything is different and my life is not the same
I must've been infected when he bit me on my hand
And now I understand why I'm feeling like a big dog
Feeling like a big dog
I noticed that I'm chasing every cat that pass by
And I think I know why I'm feeling like a big dog
Feeling like a big dog
Now are you feeling like a big dog
Said are you feeling like a big dog
I noticed that I'm chasing every cat that pass by
And I think I know why I'm feeling like a big dog
As life goes on I'm starting to learn more and more about responsibility
And I realize that everything I do is effecting the people around me
So I want to take this time out to apologize for the things that I've done
And things that haven't occurred yet
And things that they don't want to take responsibility for
I'm sorry for the times that I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know
That you were sitting home just wishing we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect
I'm sorry for the times I'd disrespect
I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there
Because I'm in the streets like everyday
I'm sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl
I understand that there's a problem
And I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'd be the reason for your pain
And you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
I'm sorry for the things daddy put you through
Like all the times you didn't know what to do
I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags
Just trying to stay busy till you heard from day
And You would rather be home with all your kids
It's one big family with love and bliss
And even though pops treated us like kings
He got a second wife and you didn't agree
He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a thief
I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not been so bad
I'm sorry that your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the feds came and took me away
I understand that there's a problem
And I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'd be the reason for your pain
And you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to see
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
The further embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl trying to have fun
Her daddy should have never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage
In a 21 and older club they say
I'm just a singer trying to entertain
Even though the blames on you
Even though the blames on you
Even though the blames on you
I'll take that blame from you
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me
And You can put that blame on me
You're the one I want to spend this night with
Trying to get in them drawers and bang it out till the morning

Rubbing that body on me

And you can have your way boy
I know it's been a while since you made my body right
And it ain't no question cause boy I love you when you put that body on me
Hey how you doing mama

What we should do today
Go tell you friends bye bye
And lets go hop a plane
Its no mistaken the attractions ironic
I wanna make you someone more then just a a bone in my closet
I wanna win that type of relationship
You say your short this month and you're late on your rent
Now you wanna come and put it on me
That you could make it feel like it never did
Keep your hands in the air while you're dropping down low
Your body looking amazing when you dancing like that
Your body looking amazing when you dancing like that
You better act like you know... to the flow
Keep your hands in the air while you're dropping down low
Your body looking amazing when you dancing like that
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed
Baby this is presidential really
A pocket full of women understanding how I'm living
Show them hoes how you winning
It's the beginning with the pearls you're given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South
When you in Magic City you be carrying a lot of clout
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
And enough heart to break all y'all jaws.
To help me out with this war
I'm laying this verse till you retire
In the ghetto which is part of the game we play
To help me out with this war
I got my people and my gun we open fire
At any time in the morning or even the evening
I'm letting you splurge till you retire.
In the ghetto which is part of the game we play
To help me out with this war
To help me out with this war
We're ready man Don't get it fucking twisted
We can get a ticket and we can fly out there and give you a visit in the cold and we can turn it into heat
Real rolling stone of our time
He's the reason why you wanna be a killer
Living the life and hoping that you make it bigger
Either you end up in the cage or in the ground
Oh you're living on the edge and you know that you gotta
Burn this bridge down if you're falling across it
Burn this bridge down like you're a plane in this ...
Put your lighters up oh
Let it burn let it burn let it burn
Put your lighters up oh
Let it burn let it burn let it burn
Your momma used to be a hooker
So many men coming in and out the house
She's the reason why you're working as a stripper
On your knees picking dollars of the ground
No way you'll rustle for that money
You ain't gonna get any surgery on your figure
They'll only bring the wrong daddy for your child
You're just like your momma and
Your daughter will be just like you
You know you're living on the edge and you know that you gotta
Burn this bridge down if you're falling across it
Burn this bridge down like you're a plane in this ...
Put your lighters up oh
Let it burn let it burn let it burn
Put your lighters up oh
Let it burn let it burn let it burn
Let it burn let it burn
Find another way to the other side
Let it burn let it burn
We'll make it to the top even we have to climb
Let it burn let it burn
Our kids are counting on us to stay around
Let it burn let it burn
Put your lighters up oh
Burn that bridge down
Burn this bridge down if you're falling across it
Burn this bridge down like you're a plane in this ...
Put your lighters up oh
Let it burn let it burn let it burn
Put your lighters up oh
Let it burn let it burn let it burn

And we prey for life situations where it determines
I never bothered you were here when I started it
And you been making it clear how to still support the kid when you have your own career when like anything
I can't go know where

How could I've allowed myself to go there
And spread my will till there wasn't enough left for myself
Just a matter of time
You find yourself searching back something inside
My heart is healed after all its taken
My heart is healed after so much breaking
I know there will be days where things will not go my way
You decide to look who you be in love
Just a matter of time
You find yourself searching back something inside
My heart is healed after all its taken
My heart is healed after so much breaking
In life there's so much to provide
Too much to sacrifice that its crazy
But I learn to accept and forgive
Just a matter of time
You find yourself searching back something inside
My heart is healed after all its taken
My heart is healed after so much breaking
I can smell smoke pass the Dutch right here
Please don't hate cause at least you can say you was with it
Clear my mind from the shit I see
That's when it really bond on me
The ghetto is all that I know
Laying back trying get this dough
Wanna feel the breeze get a new black coupe
Put a hundred on your three or your foul line shot
Lending outfits all in the bus cause none of us could
Mad hoops so the little boys might bark at you
But they all lack good if the hood bothered you
Clear my mind from the shit I see
That's when it really bond on me
The ghetto is all that I know
Laying back trying get this dough
Ladies in the club poring Chris in cups
But you still trying to act like ain't shit enough
I wanna smoke but I could search for my life
A room full of convicts and D Block militants
You can occupy my passenger side
Watch you fall in love after just one night
Bad little bitches with their booty on score trying to beat like whoa
What you want girl just let me know.
You know I'm gonna get ya.
You know I'm gonna get ya.

Threw caution to the wind yeah
Finding you somewhere somehow was never a question no
Cause while I'm restless searching for you
I know you're restless searching for me too
Heading straight to you
I left the others in the dust
I know exactly what I want
This world ain't safe

Some stone cold killers
With a pocket full of triggers

If I could give back all the love I lost
The price I pay is just to high of a cost yeah
I still need you beside me
See I met her at club on the Friday
Seeing her coming my way
I didn't see a ring on her finger
I asked her have you ever been with a singer before
So let me introduce you to my world
Big diamonds and pearls all of part of being my girl
Bet you ain't never seen before
I got them coming back for more
And that's when I noticed
The way I am touching your body
Makes me want to keep grinding
See I bet you're nasty
When you're on the dance floor
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control
Got shorty right where I want her
Baby more better than ammonia
She said she wants to bring me to bring me to her world
She whispers some words
That damn near made my toes curl
She said she's got that
That I have never seen before
And if I get the taste
I'll be coming right back for more
And that's when I noticed
The way I am touching your body
Makes me want to keep grinding
See I bet you're nasty
When you're on the dance floor
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control
I'm working your body
Like you are in my bedroom
Everybody in the club got a clear view
But that won't stop us
The way I am touching your body
Makes me want to keep grinding
See I bet you're nasty
When you're on the dance floor
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control
There's so much joy in our heart
There's so much joy in our heart
There's so much joy in our heart
Watch out I've seen her type before
If I was the last man I earth I would only take that girl end of search.
Watch out I've seen her type before
Watch out I've seen her type before
From left to right I watched her go down
Figure 8... good body shape
When she do her thing man can't walk straight
Bad heels like Jessica Pete
One lick of punch... I'm fine
Watch out I've seen her type before
Then I took her to the gym so she could get in shape
Bringing these hoes like Jacks and Jill
Hey I sit and gaze hazy eyed as I day dream
Double D's full of silicon and saline
She thirty but look only a day over 18
And peel ya out ya jeans and eat it like a tangerine
Back in the club already
No more fantasies I want the real thing.

She's my dream girl my one and only
My dream girl love it when she call on me
My dream girl it's just me and you against the world.
Ass poked out like Lisa Ray jelly hips thighs waist Gabrielle Union's face
Strapped with Oprah Winfrey's cheese in a house on a hill in the West Indies
If you let me I could give you anything that you need
There's no person that could take your place
I'm like a fat kid with cake when we face to face
Heart paced when you're here but erased when you're gone
She's my dream girl my one and only
My dream girl love it when she call on me
My dream girl it's just me and you against the world.
No lie girl I feel like my dream came true
You and I plus ten and a little bit more
My dream girl it's just me and you against the world.

When you're lonely just give me a call
And we plan to be till eternity
Maybe I'm just a dreamer
Got me feeling like I need her
Every day I'm getting weaker
Got me feeling like I need her
Yeah that trap or die shit

On my suit and tie shit
Fully packed up and holy
Best believe that it's loaded
Telling you now brother

Where the... who it is
So get your money together and... who it is
The industry intruder
On the corner with the keys in hand
We'll leave you where you stand
We'll lift you off your feet and make you fly like Peter Pan
Don't make no sudden moves
Or I'll squeeze my southern tools
While I'm with my southern bitch
26 inches no southern shoes
Groupies cry they eyes out
Wasn't born with a silver spoon
You better drop down low when you hear that
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now

That means they're asking for it
They're asking for it
I know that you like it
Your body's what I'm enticed with
Move around like you work it girl
But that ain't you in the slightest
Love the way that she hide it
Says she want me inside it
Baby girl got the Superwoman
Made her drop to her knees
Got a taste of this... taller than all of your trees
She'll pin me down to my seat
... Rolling it to the beat
I had to come and take full control
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now

Ha look out guess who it is
Where the best do it is
So get your money together and bet who it is
The industry intruder
On the corner with the keys in hand
We'll leave you where you stand
We'll lift you off your feet and make you fly like Peter Pan
Don't make no sudden moves
Or I'll squeeze my southern tools
26 inches no southern shoes
Groupies cry they eyes out
Wasn't born with a silver spoon
You better drop down low when you hear that
I know that you like it
Your body's what I'm enticed with
Move around like you work it girl
But that ain't you in the slightest
Love the way that she hide it
Says she want me inside it
Baby girl got the Superwoman
Made her drop to her knees
Taller than all of your trees
She'll pin me down to my seat
And rolling hips to the beat
I had to come and take full control
And everywhere you go
Throw some threads on
I'm out like a candle
You won't believe what I got
And I just bought two more
400 grand they both came
With my eyes all hazy
I could steal your lady
And everywhere you go
Ask who designed this
That's more money I get
I just come to the island
Where we all be wild and
If you got some girlfriends
The phantom can fit us all
But I just went against the grade
And it felt like harmony
I don't want it to ever go away
I want it around me every day
That bobble in my pants got me caught up
It's feels so good had me sprung out on this love
But I just went against the grade
And it felt like harmony
I don't want it to ever go away
I want it around me every day
That oil all over her body stole my heart
But I just went against the grade
And it felt like harmony
I don't want it to ever go away
I want it around me every day
How in the fuck am I gonna back my first album up
Well everything has changed
It'll never be the same
Then everybody knows my name
And I feel so ashamed
But it's so crazy man
Everyday it's just the same thing
Now it's been months out on the road
And I just wanna know
I let this shit get the best of me
And now I gotta let ya know
It's hitting my window pane
And now I gotta let ya know
One's got my face in a frown
Of the thunder that's crashing down
Now I gotta let ya know
Now I got no more worries now
My pocket's fatter now
Why do I feel this way
Everything I've been given
But I can't escape the rain
Now it's been months out on the road
And I just wanna know
I let this shit get the best of me
And now I gotta let ya know
It's hitting my window pane
And now I gotta let ya know
One's got my face in a frown
Of the thunder that's crashing down
Now I gotta let ya know
And waiting for a miracle to pass them by
Most of them are known drug dealers and I know them well
That's the only way they know how to survive
It's the only way to get by
If I had a choice aside from this life god knows I try...
And waiting for a miracle to pass them by
Most of them are known drug dealers and I know them well
That's the only way they know how to survive
It's the only way to get by
If I had a choice aside from this life god knows I try...
And waiting for a miracle to pass them by
Most of them are known drug dealers and I know them well
That's the only way they know how to survive
It's the only way to get by
If I had a choice aside from this life god knows I try...
And there's no one to hold on too and there's no one to pull you out
Dark memories of when there was no sunshine
Whoever said that this drama would stop today
A lot of niggers dead or locked away
Teenage women growing up with aids
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
I remember I was just like you
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
Our lifestyles be close captioned
Addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
No fairy tales for this young black male
If you believe then you can achieve
To all the seeds that follow me
I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
Last I heard I was dead
Cause that's the life when your
Yo I know him we two individual people we waged a coastal
Beef but even tho we were going through our drama I would
If I could recollect before my hood days
Cause any day they'll push the button
There's no need for you to fear me
I hope we see the light before its ruined
Whoever said that this struggle would stop today
Teenage Women growing up with aids
Cause that's the life when your
That's the life when your
Tell me do you see that old lady ain't it sad
Guess she's given birth to a baby
We jump into another form of slavery
Even now I keep discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage
I refuse to be a role model
And when its said and done
I feel his hand on my brain
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace in that war on the streets
Whoever said that this struggle would stop today
Teenage Women growing up with aids
Cause that's the life when your
That's the life when your
These streets remind me of quicksand
And there's no one to hold on too
So you end up self destructing
Dark memories of when there was no sunshine
That's the life when your
Even the life that you have is borrowed
Once you move forward can't go back
Best prepare to remove your past
Yes there gotta be there gotta be a better way
Yes ya gotta be willing to pray
Whoever said that the struggle would stop today
That's the life when your
Gun shots every night in the
Crooked cops on sight in the
Everyday is a fight in the
Got kids to feed in the
Hey ladies drop it down
Just want to see you touch the ground
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies drop it down
Just want to see you touch the ground
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Do you have any idea what you starting girl
Little touch is a ditty
I can hear her purring up
What's the man without the plan B
While I watch this beautiful thing shake that ass
Hey ladies drop it down
Just want to see you touch the ground
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies drop it down
Just want to see you touch the ground
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Girl you could do anything you want in here
You ain't even gotta drop down if you want to
Lap dancing for my FA crew
Up in the VIP with no fee
Hey ladies drop it down
Just want to see you touch the ground
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies drop it down
Just want to see you touch the ground
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Girl shake ya body body
Whatever you do don't break your body body

Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies drop it down

Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey ladies drop it down
Just want to see you touch the ground
Take it easy young boys I got my eyes on you
And I'm posted on the corner with that thing on my side
Another one off in the wood box
I know the look so I'm a ride on him
You know I keep the thing on the corner
You got your eyes on me
I find myself wandering up the road with a gun in my hand
I find myself wandering up the road with a gun in my hand
I find myself wandering up the road with a gun in my hand
The one who has taped it put a hole in ya now
I'm not the type to commit it then go admit it
And tighten it up with my belt cause thugs throw your fittings
Fine yourself under the sand
Fine yourself under the sand
I'm not that man you would find yourself under the sand
To feel up your shoes
To feel up your shoes
Lil mama so bad she had me hypnotized
Couldn't even get my eyes out off her
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round
All I need now is some moaning
That pussy got me zoned
O fine tell me she wanted
She got it fuck how she on me
I'm locked down as that monkey
That ass on her she talking
I see me up and I'm pocking
She bend over and I'm stroking
Her cheeks spread wide open
I been there and I'm focus
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round
I fuck her ones and she's sold
I'm in the private shows
No limits everything goes
Just stand on front of me and pose
You touch mine I touch yours
Then get all strong as mine goes
First time I seen her I froze
I had to get her she know
She worked then she fall
She want the goon and then show
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round
Nappy headed brothers never had no ladies
And I hit the barber shop real quick
Then I couldn't get no job
Then I thought about my dogs from the block
Kinda understand why they chose to steal and rob
Was it the hair that got me this far
I hate to say it but it seem so flawed
Little girl with the press and curl
I was a source of so much laughter
At fifteen when it all broke off
Eighteen and went all natural
I went on and did what I had to do
Because it was time to change my life
To become the woman that I am inside
I looked in the mirror for the first time and saw that
I am the soul that lives within
At the turn of the century
It's time for us to redefine who we be
You can shave it off like a South African beauty
Or get in on lock like Bob Marley
You can rock it straight like Oprah Winfrey
I am the soul that lives within
Steady judging one another by their appearance
I am expressing my creativity
Breast cancer and chemotherapy
She promised God if she was to survive
On national television
Her diamond eyes are sparkling
I am the soul that lives within
Having sex should make a nice man out the meanest
And I called my parents right after I was done
I wanna tell the world
I'm so humbled by a girl's ability to let me do her
Plus she let me wear my chain and my turtleneck sweaters
So this one's dedicated to them girls
That let us flop around on top of them
So if you had sex in the last thirty minutes
Then you qualified to sing with me
A woman let me put my penis inside of her
She say she love me till the end of time
She say she love me till the end of time
What's love gotta do with it
What's love gotta do with it
I had my doubts before
Can't let you tie me down
I wanna have fun and mess around
I gotta stand my ground
Though you're the best thing I found
What's love gotta do with it
What's love gotta do with it
I hope for goodness sake
You gave me no reason to escape
I pray for God some days
We fight and go our separate ways
What's love gotta do with it
What's love gotta do with it
Say that she love me till the end of time
Say that she love me till the end of time
What's love gotta do with it
What's love gotta do with it
What's love gotta do with it
What's love gotta do with it
I love the way she moves
I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body
I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body
I know she's waiting for me
I love the way she moves
I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body
I know she's waiting for me
I love the way she moves
I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body
Shorty so sexy I wanna take you to my crib
I love the way she moves
I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body
Girl I spend money like it don't mean nothing and besides I got a thing for you.
Normally don't get caught up too fast but I got a thing for you.
I'm sorry but I got to go
Got to get this money though
Kiss me when I'm on my way
On my Way up out the door
Gucci rag money in my bag You
At least not until I make it to the top
Selling off the dresser
Don't want my Gucci sweater
See I refuse to go back
That's why I got my bags packed
I just want you to know that
I gotta go make this cash Baby Baby
I gotta go make this cash
The only way to get it is to get it off
Hard times is what we can't stand
If you with me let me hear ya say
See I refuse to go back
That's why I got my bags packed
I just want you to know that
I gotta go make this cash Baby Baby
I gotta go make this cash
I'm out North for the summer
I'm South for the winter
I'm out North for the summer
I'm South for the winter
I gotta go make this cash Baby Baby
I gotta go make this cash
I'm not a sucker for love
All day and nights end
Wondering if we ever change
Why you wanna push it away
I swear that I know you know
The shit that we've been through is not
The only thing that broke me down
Girl you should know by now
Cause this is how it goes
You play me for a fool
I've been down that road before
Cause ain't nothing better than reconsidering the pain
Now your heart is bleeding tears
They're falling down your face
Said to get a grip cause you can always be replaced
Cause ain't nothing better than reconsidering the fall
I'm not a sucker for love
Girl I put that on everything
Even though I wine you and dine you
And always keep you entertained
I'm not a sucker for love
Don't take my kindness for weakness
And then expect me to treat you the same
I'll drop you off on the turnpike
Then continue switching lanes
If there's a moment in truth in a relationship
You getting close to it
Girl I ain't trying to hear it
I give you everything
You're throwing it away
Now your telling you need a minute or two
To think about those 4 letters you said to me
Your pushing me to the ledge
And I'm about to let it go
Cause this is how it goes
You play me for a fool
I've been down that road before
Cause ain't nothing better than reconsidering the pain
Now your heart is bleeding tears
They're falling down your face
Said to get a grip cause you can always be replaced
Cause ain't nothing better than reconsidering the fall
I'm not a sucker for love
Girl I put that on everything
Even though I wine you and dine you
And always keep you entertained
I'm not a sucker for love
Don't take my kindness for weakness
And then expect me to treat you the same
I'll drop you off on the turnpike
Then continue switching lanes
Take it like amphetamines
Try to lead try to dream
See it as possibilities
Even with my ego you deal with me
See we close the deal you see
Giving you everything
Everything that you see
I'm a show you California's finest
If you trip then you letting out that demon
I'm not a sucker for love
Girl I put that on everything
Even though I wine you and dine you
And always keep you entertained
I'm not a sucker for love
Don't take my kindness for weakness
And then expect me to treat you the same
I'll drop you off on the turnpike
Then continue switching lanes
Ooh ooh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Ooh ooh oh oh oh oh oh oh ooh
I just wanna tell you that I made a mistake
No knowing I was taking with me out of my mind
I know I messed up this time
I know I messed up this time
Ooh ooh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ooh ooh oh
I'm a hustler and don't need them
Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
I'd rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Than to let them haters come and make a name off me
I'm a hustler and don't need them
For a driver to hit you up and drop you off and that's all
I'm a hustler and don't need them
Only to find out you live in a doll house
We bury powers on the set that they come from
We know magic turn weed smoke to gun smoke
We ball first when we ride
You in a Hearse when you ride
I put my shoe down baby
I'm a hustler and don't need them
I beat you to the punchline
When I say I love you
Late at night when no one's listening
Praying I stay the same
Not trying to hurt you
Your walls are so impossible
They keep on multiplying
Is why you can't let it go
Cause everything you ever want
Is standing right in front of you
Everything you ever need
I make sure I put by for you
And I know you're scared
And I've had my days too
Let's just face this thing together
Give me that chance baby
Said I wanna love you
Always around when u call
Always around leave the fun
So please stay in your place
Hate to find you with no face
Better yet gone with no trace
Other words please don't start no beef
Now sip on your Chardonnay
If the girls tipsy then fade away
I can tell that you wanna play
Cause it's written all over your face
From here it's back to the block
Always around when u call
Always around leave the fun
Always around when u call
Always around leave the fun
Always around when u call
Always around leave the fun
Now it's that puff puff pass shit
We roll shit that burn slow as fucking molasses
Andre 3001 another classic
Yeah puff puff pass that shit right here
Type of shit that have ya leaning sideways
Make her work for this suicide
No need to fly to Jamaica
Need it for my cataracts
You can tell them Cali back
No it ain't no seeds in my sack
You ain't never gotta ask dog
What you think I'm on
Yeah I really doubt it
You can put it in a zag or a blunt and get blunted
Type of shit that have ya leaning sideways
Make her work for this suicide
No need to fly to Jamaica
Hold up wait a minute
You can go put it back
And as i sold the last bag fucked around and got locked up
No matter how far I go
And now they don't stop me and I get locked up
Back with a couple keys
Corner blocks on fire
Under covers dressed as fiends
Ride up smooth and fast
And as I sold the last bag fucked around and got locked up
Seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is getting empty
My cell mates getting food without me
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up
Send me some magazines
Send me some money orders
I remember when we was young and the price tag on those days and nights
And every time I think I figured it out the universe expands.
But it's a whole lot of precious life left for you to live.
But I'm gonna see you in a minute doe.
I have nobody for my own
I have nobody for my own
Then one day she can't take it no more and decide to leave
So I had to take a little ride
Can't believe I had a girl like you
After all I put you through
You still stuck around and stayed by my side
What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby you a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
That could take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come where you would get up and run
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely
Never thought that I'd be alone
I didn't think you'd be gone this long
I just want you to call my phone
Baby girl I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out
I never wished to ever hurt my baby
Slow down time after time
But he never would listen
Until he got some time
The life that he was living
I knew it wasn't right
The judge gave him that sentence
And put him up for life
You don't miss the water
Till the well runs dry
Don't miss the living till they die
Don't know the reason
We just let life pass us by
See my best friend used to stay with me
Each and every day he'd chill with me
Always told me to pray for me
But I always thought that he'll be fine
Now I got to watch his mother cry
Till the well runs dry
Don't miss the living till they die
Don't know the reason
We just let life pass us by.
So don't you take for granted
The life you've been handed
Be thankful and grateful
Plus there's so many people worse off than you
With no chance of changing
I said look at me know.
Think about it each and every day.
I said look at me know.
Think about it each and every day.
I came in the game with a name I was given
From a man who didn't give a fuck about his legitimate.
I proclaim the name though.
Never in vain though.
Watch the change grow.
Now they want my brains on the main row.
But they don't understand what I came for.
Who say you can't grow from mildew and mold.
Its time time to go start puffin up trees.
Gotta get off right away.
You look like the kinda woman girl
The type to have me starring in a sexual scandal
You look like the kinda woman girl
The type to have me starring in a sexual scandal
And that ain't helping at all
But that ain't stopping you from being naughty
It's like you want me to climb in and fall
What am I supposed to do
When you're... that at me like a big ball
But I gotta think about me too
But you have to spread yourself on the wall
You look like the kinda woman girl
The type to have me starring in a sexual scandal
So much love to share
So much love to share
This is for all the love
And the life took away
Don't forget we were bought and trade
Ripped from the land and shipped away
Is the inspiration we use to survive
Have to see it with your own cries
No play add it up and arrive
The land is so gold and green
The place is so fresh and clean
And everyday I water my garden
Tell me if you feel it deep in your heart
And if you just believe in the most high
I know you'll be all right
That's my favorite place when I need to get away
Must forget but we can't forget to pray
Gonna accept mass alright
Skin is so dark and brown
She lifts me right off the ground
But no you not gonna see it on you TV
So just listen up and believe me
Her trees have the only cure
Her love is so new and pure
Had to kiss them troubles goodbye bye
No I don't have to lie
So tell me can you feel it
Senegal can you feel it
So much love to share
Don't miss don't miss one moment about it
So much love to share
Resist this bliss though I really doubt it
So much love so much love to share
Is for ambition our dream we envision
Your smart enough to recognize my plan
A mystery become some history then change it damn
Damn I thought you spanned
Had a piece beyond average for her I'm a savage
Work that body girl twist that body
Ass so big barely pull your pants up
Hands in the air put your booty where the flow at
Pause for the picture shorty we could take a Kodak
Cause you got some mean on
I like you painted them jeans on
And then your whole click bad and you team strong
I like all that seduction
I gotta show her what's up then
But if she wanna rock with a player
She gonna have to follow my instructions
You be feeling the same
Nobody to tell you no
So you be feeling no shame
Make your boyfriend mad uh huh
Make your boyfriend mad uh huh
I bet your baby daddy can't do that
That what ever you like
I give it to you right
He gonna give it for a second
He just do it just to do it
I just do it like mike
I like all that seduction
I gotta show her what's up then
But if she wanna rock with a player
She gonna have to follow my instructions
Work that body girl like
Work that body girl like
Ain't nothing like watching you rock for me
Go ahead girl and just drop for me
While I just sit back
Hoping that you don't plan to stop for me
Well about a hundred thousand stacks for me
Well I know you like that
But I also like it when you
I have nobody for my own
I have nobody for my own
Took all the bullshit
Then one day she can't take it no more
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Back tracking on these few years
Can't believe I had a girl like you
Around and stayed by my side
You were good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
Been all about the world ain't never met a girl
That can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come
Where you'd get up and run and I would be out chasing you
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Then the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely
Never thought that I would be alone
I didn't think you'd be gone this long
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playing girl and
Baby girl I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out
I never wished to ever
Before I get you by my side
Tell you what's been on my mind
Mistakes were made between us two
But the strength I have is washing away.
I'm gonna make sure you never forget me
All I want is for you to remember my name
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
Genuine ghetto survivors when they gain terror inside
For what we done did on these streets
And what we done spit on these records
The lyrical serial killer
No time for second chances
N when it all goes down and they put me in my grave
All I want is for you to remember my name
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
My reputation is solid gold
Known as th little boss hog in the hood
Boy in my hood I'm a superstar
But I put in my work and checked it checked it
They envy deep in they hearts
Fuck with mine and I'll charge
Stand up man on his feet
All I want is for you to remember my name
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
What I got to do for you not to forget who bought you with that straight thug spin
He left the right ones an hes still in th hood
That's why I know I gotta reach you with these beats
All I want is for you to remember my name
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
All I want is for you to remember my name
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
Learn to move packages in and out of Los Angeles
On top of the ostrich and foxes
With the last stress on my chest
See I know you'll like my swagger
No strap when I come through
It's the west coast back at your front door
I'm the king but I play with the aces
Run up to find out I keep it loaded like bases
See I know you'll like my swagger
No strap when I come through
See when I walk through the door
Convicts surround the whole compound
See I know you'll like my swagger
No strap when I come through
We may not understand this whole process and how things go
See a man with a blue tie
See a man with a red tie
So how about we tie ourselves together and get it done
Do what's right for America
And all we ask from you is some honesty
And motivation give us something we believe
I'm only one man with a voice to something we got in common
Need a model well then look at me
There's a fight and a race who's gonna win
Put your differences aside man if you can
I wish they didn't have no labels
There'd be more change with no labels
My kids will grow up soon
Your kids will grow up too
Wouldn't you like to see them raised up next to good hospitals and good schools
When all this time you could've made a difference but you decided to roll with the party
And motivation give us something we believe
I'm only one man with a voice to something we got in common
Just one look in the mirror
And I know I don't look the same being alone
I don't know how I made it before
And now that it's over I don't know how I'm gonna get by
Can't believe there's no more you
I look at my passenger side
And there's nobody to ride with me for life
Because your side ain't occupied
Can't believe there's no more you
Don't know if I can make it or not
Everybody sees that I'm going through a lot
When you used to be on top
I stop for a minute then I pinch myself
I can't believe I'm here by myself
I can't do anything without your help.
Can't believe there's no more you
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no
Fight for our right to love yeah
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody thought we'd last forever
Things between us don't get better
Seem like everybody wanna go for self
And don't wanna respect boundaries
Just to get on your side
But I must admit there was a couple secrets
But just know that I tried
To keep you satisfied
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no
Fight for our right to love yeah
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no
Got every right to wanna leave
Got every right to wanna go
Got every right to hit the road
And never talk to me no more
You don't even have to call
Even check for me at all
Has been off the wall
Especially toward you
Most of it just ain't you
And they won't show you
How much of a queen you are to me
And why I love you baby
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no
Fight for our right to love yeah
Nobody wanna see us together

Said it's the only thing we know how to do
Come on baby and drop it
Scrub that floor and just mop it
Show these gangsters how you pop lock it
Don't care what you got in your pocket
Wanna I just bang bang and pop it
The only thing we know how to do
Said it's the only thing we know how to do
Some pressure that we can push
Ladies can't get enough
The only thing we know how to do
Said it's the only thing we know how to do
The only thing we know how to do
Said it's the only thing we know how to do
As life goes on I'm starting to learn more and more about responsibility
I realize everything I do is affecting the people around me
So I want to take this time out to apologize for things I have done
And things that have not occurred yet
And the things they don't want to take responsibility for
I'm sorry for the times I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know
That you were sitting home just wishing we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect
I'm sorry for the times I disrespect
I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my son
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there
Because I am in the streets like everyday
Sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl
I understand that there are some problems
And I am not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
Sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do
Sorry that you had to go and sell those packs
Just trying to stay busy till you heard from Dad
And you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though Pops treated us like kings
He got a second wife and you didn't agree
He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a thief
I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the FEDS came and took me away
I'm sorry that it took so long to see
They were dead wrong trying to put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
For the embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl trying to have fun
Her daddy should never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage
In a 21 and older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame
I'm just a singer trying to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame
I'll take that blame from you
You can put that blame on me
I know you don't really want me to make it
I know you hate the fact that I'm so fly
And I see you like what you see and want to take it
I know you really don't wanna die
You don't want anything to be your pain
You got more to lose than you got to gain
But you know we won't stop now
No matter where we go
There's no one above me
We running the country
I know you want to see it
But you can't control us
I know you don't really want me to make it
I know you hate the fact that I'm so fly
And I see you like what you see and want to take it
I know you really don't wanna die
You don't want anything to be your pain
You got more to lose than you got to gain
I know they hating on me
Calm when it's plain to see
Then you can see my style
Doing what I like and I don't care what they say
Don't know why they hate like that
Tell me why they hate like that
I see them through my window
Trying to take everything I got
I can see it in your eyes
I'm dancing on your mind
Well come round with me motherfucker can we do or die

I know you hate the fact that I'm so fly
And I see you like what you see and want to take it

But I see they try to take everything I got

They feel like they mess with me
But to show I'm gonna make it yeah

With that beautiful skin the color of muster
Now jump in the backseat and chill
Got some for you girl you can feel
Lay your body down in the six forty five
Let the soft leather caress ya while I drill
And just ride her like a range rover
Daylight come and now we want a little more of that

We can bump heads than collide on me

Looking all oiled up and all greasy

And you never been a lame hoe
With that booty bought and paid for
Won't move till you're on my payroll
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me
Smack that all on the floor

Smack that till you get sore
The ice in the watch reflects the light to her
The sweat might kill her
So I say goodnight to her
She don't want me to leave
I can see right through her
Get low like Caribbean limbo
Then you go out like light
We can cruise in the car or we can take flight
The middle of the night
Make your body act like Mike Vick against the Eagles
To be this hot it's not legal
But we don't care listen baby it's a fact that
We can go deep and I can shark attack that
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that till you get sore
I thought about it man but I'm way to fly
That's why I keep that thing my side
Even had trouble wit the law
On the couch when they smashed my door
I could never understand the cause
I was the one to pull the shortest straw
I'm in blue wit them BF frames
Couldn't come closer if you sat in my range
I get it in till the sunrise
Windows rolled down screaming out
Number one hustler getting money
Why you wanna count my money
I'm a hustler and don't need one of them
One of y'all you see I'm so paid
I see police on that crooked
Got a system that will beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat sawed off
Got a bunch of goons hope they never call off
I'm a sniper on the roof already saw y'all
Ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason I had to put the blame on me
Id rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Than to let them haters come and make a name off me
That's why I get it in till the sun rise
Windows rolled down screaming out
Number one hustler getting money
Why you wanna count my money
I'm a hustler and don't need one of them
One of y'all you see that I'm so paid
I'm the boss it only takes one call
For a driver to hit you up and drop you off and that's all
Black royal holding down jersey
My little brother screw got that vision baby
I get it in till the sunrise
Windows rolled down screaming out
Number one hustler getting money
Why you want to count my money
I'm a hustler and don't need one of them
One of y'all you see I'm so paid
Snap my fingers disappear from the precinct yeah
We ball in and we ball out
Thoughts of we falling underneath the ball bounce
Only to find out that you live in a doll house
We carry choppers on our necks call it cut throat
We bury powers from the set that we came from
We know magic turn weed smoke to gun smoke
We ball first when we ride
You in a hearse when you ride
I put my shoe down baby
That's why I get it in till the sunrise
Windows rolled down screaming out
Number one hustler getting money
Why you wanna count my money
I'm a hustler and don't need one of them
I know it when I met you
It's what I have to step too
Girl cause your special.
Girl cause your special
I wanna take the time to just look at you and hope one day you will be my
No need to wake me up I'm happy in my dream
Girl cause your special.
How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets
How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat
You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day
Stay down stay down just to live a better way
Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day
Stay down stay down just to live a better way
How many blacks gotta die by the hands of another
Don't you understand that man's the same color so that man is your brother
That's what happens when that man is from the gutter
He never knew what family was he grew up in a broken home
Ever since twelve years old he was known as grown
And even though it seemed like school was the best plan
While everybody else was getting diplomas
He graduated from the middle of the strip to the corner
I just see eye 2 eye wit his struggle you know
How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets
How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat
You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day
Stay down stay down just to live a better way
Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day
Stay down stay down just to live a better way
Now baby girl's got a promising future
But her moms passed away while she was younger and her father's a loser
He'd always abused her but what else you expect from a coward
He wasn't even proud when she got accepted to Howard
And even though she loves college everyday it would stress her
But it wasn't cause of exams or she hate her professor
It was her financial situation here she couldn't pay a semester
And the only means of making it better was totally reversing the role
Lap dancing working that pole even though deep down its hurting her soul
And even if it meant taking off her clothes
She was down for what ever to help her accomplish her personal goals
I guess I just see eye to eye with her vision you know
How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets
How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat
You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day
Stay down stay down just to live a better way
Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day
Stay down stay down just to live a better way
Now see the moral of the story is this
Cause really at the end of the day it's not y'all struggle
But you always got something to say
Well hear this fuck you
Yeah that's right I'm talking to you come try to sleep in our beds
Look at the world from our view try to live by our rules
I guarantee you won't maintain your health you'll probably try to end it all
And hang yourself or bang yourself
You couldn't possibly understand all pain we felt
And without folding your hands play the games we dealt
Matter fact I feel I'm wasting my time
I'm finished writing this rhyme
Y'all never gonna see eye to eye with my people you know
How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets
How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat
You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day
Stay down stay down just to live a better way
Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day
You think you won't need me
But you know that we're in this together
You can try to push me from you
Nothing you do will keep us a part
Stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Stuck in love with each other
Now I can say that I would not care
Tell myself that I'll be fine without ya
And I can try to convince you
Baby we're stuck with each other
Baby we're stuck with each other
Stuck in love with each other
There's nothing I'd rather do
Than to sit with you forever
Than to be stuck with you
Baby we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Baby we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Stuck in love with each other
Baby we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Baby we're stuck with each other
Stuck with each other
Stuck in love with each other
I'm not a sucker for love
All day and nights end
Wondering if we ever change
Why you wanna push it away
I swear that I know you know
The shit that we've been through is not
The only thing that broke me down
Girl you should know by now
Cause this is how it goes
You play me for a fool
I've been down that road before
Cause ain't nothing better than reconsidering the pain
Now your heart is bleeding tears
They're falling down your face
Said to get a grip cause you can always be replaced
Cause ain't nothing better than reconsidering the fall
I'm not a sucker for love
Girl I put that on everything
Even though I wine you and dine you
And always keep you entertained
I'm not a sucker for love
Don't take my kindness for weakness
And then expect me to treat you the same
I'll drop you off on the turnpike
Then continue switching lanes
If there's a moment in truth in a relationship
You getting close to it
Girl I ain't trying to hear it
I give you everything
You're throwing it away
Now your telling you need a minute or two
To think about those 4 letters you said to me
Your pushing me to the ledge
And I'm about to let it go
Cause this is how it goes
You play me for a fool
I've been down that road before
Cause ain't nothing better than reconsidering the pain
Now your heart is bleeding tears
They're falling down your face
Said to get a grip cause you can always be replaced
Cause ain't nothing better than reconsidering the fall
I'm not a sucker for love
Girl I put that on everything
Even though I wine you and dine you
And always keep you entertained
I'm not a sucker for love
Don't take my kindness for weakness
And then expect me to treat you the same
I'll drop you off on the turnpike
Then continue switching lanes
Take it like amphetamines
Try to lead try to dream
See it as possibilities
Even with my ego you deal with me
See we close the deal you see
Giving you everything
Everything that you see
I'm a show you California's finest
If you trip then you letting out that demon
I'm not a sucker for love
Girl I put that on everything
Even though I wine you and dine you
And always keep you entertained
I'm not a sucker for love
Don't take my kindness for weakness
And then expect me to treat you the same
I'll drop you off on the turnpike
Then continue switching lanes
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
I know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt whatsoever
We can make it better
I want to get away to our sweet escape
I've been getting a little lazy waiting on you to come save me
I can see that your angry by the way that you treat me
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
I know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt whatsoever
We can make it better
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
I know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt whatsoever
We can make it better
I want to get away to our sweet escape
Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill
She wined for the bill
High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
Never thought she would come and work for the president
Cash rules everything around me
Cash rules everything around me
On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of
For triple times the money and spending it how they wanna
But I know there's a drop in the block
You don't know not to lay low
Because 25 to life is no joke
Cash rules everything around me
Cash rules everything around me
It drives the world crazy
She used to be the sweetest girl ever
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks off the track right by school
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
Cash rules everything around me
Cash rules everything around me
Some live for the bill
She wined for the bill
So lets take a chance.
It's like once in a lifetime.
It's like once in a lifetime.
So lets take a chance.
We could go at the back
So don't nobody know.
If you're looking forward
Right before I take you home
Before I take you home
Watch how many rags I blow.
They say this chick is best for my...
Alone staring out of my window
But what if she knows that I am spying on her
Would she strip down naked and entertain me
Oh my god she's doing it
She knows I'm watching her
Alone staring out of my window
But what if she knows that I am spying on her
Would she strip down naked and entertain me
Oh my god she's doing it
She knows I'm watching her
Alone staring out of my window
But what if she knows that I am spying on her
Would she strip down naked and entertain me
Alone staring out of my window
I see the best creation of woman that I ever saw in a long long time
Once she strip down naked and entertain me
Then threw her dress up on a floor
Alone staring out of my window
I see the best creation of woman that I ever saw in a long long time
Once she strip down naked and entertain me
Then threw her dress up on a floor
Alone staring out of my window
I see the best creation of woman that I ever saw in a long long time
Once she strip down naked and entertain me
That's me on the corner
Weed stashed next to my burger
That's me on the corner
Weed stashed next to my burger
That's me on the corner
Weed stashed next to my burger
That's me on the corner
Weed stashed next to my burger
That's me on the corner
Weed stashed next to my burger
But simply I don't trust her
And the things she wears
One touch of her mind and that's the reason I lost her
Simply I wanna plug ya
There's something about the way she moves
Not the type of guy to waste no time
Only got one thing that's on my mind
Got me speaking in tongues
But simply I don't trust her
And the things she wears
One touch of her mind and that's the reason I lost her
Simply I wanna plug ya
Things about me so sexual
Not the type of guy to waste no time
Only got one thing that's on my mind
Got me speaking in tongues
And the things she wears
One touch of her mind and that's the reason I lost her
Simply I wanna plug ya
So affective what shall I do
Can't keep my hands off of you
Girl it's just you and me
But simply I don't trust her
And the things she wears
One touch of her mind and that's the reason I lost her
Simply I wanna plug ya
Harder to reach when you make your first mil in
Living this life of mine
If it really got what it takes
It just won't go away
In every direction everybody need money
My kin folks in the block
Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
Baby I'm a troublemaker
See I'm that type of guy you won't love
I'm that type of guy you won't cuff
I'm that type of guy you daddy won't let go out
I'm that type of guy that will save ya
I'm that type that will call you later
Won't be around to give you that time
Gotta get on the grind and get to that paper that I can do
Gotta keep my baby girl laced up in the latest and the fliest suits
Then I walk up in the place with a pocket full of money
My brother like I are the dude
Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
Baby I'm a troublemaker
See I'm that type of guy that likes kissing
I'm that type that will pop the clip and
I'm that type of guy that put you in your place
I'm that type that will let you go
I'm that type that will let you know
But there ain't too many know how to get that dough
That's the type of girl I want around me
Look like something you would see on TV
She don't mind climbing up that ladder
But this time they wanna see us together
Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
Baby I'm a troublemaker
Even though I wanna take you everywhere I go
And I realize being with you girls brings more girls
And that's just what I'm attracted to
And I'd rather go all the way
Love her long time till the break of day
I won't let her leave my bed
Till she sees the Color Purple like Annie Mae
Now she wants to start holding on me
Like whatever she's smoking on
I'll be long gone before you can say
Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
All the way to Los Angeles California
From the dry lands to over seas baby
To all my beautiful ladies
I'm steady looking for you baby
And I can't believe that you got me
You got me so high and confused
I don't know what to do
You got me so high and confused
I don't know what to do
It's so hard because I'm so...
You got me so high and confused
Now I'm looking in the back while I'm looking in the front
I couldn't sworn that she walked right past me baby
Make her sipping on jack and tack
I couldn't sworn that she look right at me
The beauty got me going crazy
You got me so high and confused
I don't know what to do
You got me so high and confused
I don't know what to do
I ain't try to talk a lot
Baby all I wanna know is how far you wanna go
Going crazy my heart is breaking
Don't know how I'll do this
I'll just die if I can't see your face
I still need you beside me
If I could give back all the love I lost
The price I pay is just to high of a cost yeah
I still need you beside me
So you don't deal with clowns
Like a superstar that you are
What I must do to make you...
Don't It feel so good girl
Don't It feel so good girl
He a lame he don't matter
Walked right up to the front
Where the bosses park at
I got a cold mouth piece
Can talk a chick out her check
Let me in with no sweat
And have some relation
So you don't deal with clowns
Like a superstar that you are
What I must do to make you...
Don't It feel so good girl
Don't It feel so good girl
Whole crew fine but you're one of a kind
So you don't deal with clowns
Like a superstar that you are
What I must do to make you...
Don't It feel so good girl
Don't It feel so good girl
Love the way you drop low and bend it
Love the way you that shake it up
Too natural you to make it up
Won't be long till we wake it up
So you don't deal with clowns
Like a superstar that you are
What I must do to make you...
Don't It feel so good girl
Let's live it up like it's 3010
What if this was the end
So invite all your family and friends
I know you're drunk and I know you're high
When you're thinking back to this day
Let's live it up like it's 3010
What if this was the end.
So invite all your family and friends
When you're thinking back to this day
Let's live it up like it's 3010
What if this was the end.
So invite all your family and friends
Facing trouble every day
Trying to walk away from a life of sorrow
It's a struggle every day
I need to take it slow
My heart is growing cold
I'm trying to hide my feelings
From the people that I know
And everywhere I go I'm trying to lay low
I'm trying to live life right
God knows with all my might
But I'm just barely getting by
And I can say this right
The struggle and the fight
Making me feel like there is no other way
But the different streets get that dough
Facing trouble every day
Trying to walk away from a life of sorrow
It's a struggle every day
Don't need feds all upon it
I done left that life alone
And then my conscience told me
Always complaining after I ain't never did
She always lonely. So what am I to do
Then I gotta deal with her attitude
It's making me feel like there is no other way
But the different streets get that dough
Facing trouble every day
Trying to walk away from a life of sorrow
It's a struggle every day
I met her on the walk way
Staring as she walked pass
She looked back at me side ways and said
I can't help but to ask
We end up going back to her place
Wish I could tell you what I saw
Until you hear her say
So They Called Her Mouth A Motor
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
What did I make her say
When I am not by her side
I wanna bring my tonight and share that look on your face
I met her on the walk way
Stared as she walked pass
She looked back at me side ways and said
I can't help but to ask
We end up going back to her place
Wish I could tell you what I saw
The sexiest women in a negligee
Until you hear her say
So They Called Her Mouth A Motor
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
What did I make her say
And that's the reason she cries is
When I am not by her side
I wanna bring back the night and share that look on your face
I want to make her say
Now is New York in here
Now is the south in here
We gonna stay in here
Girl shake your ass in here
Let's make it last in here
And toast your glass in here
My ladies crank it up
And drop it down and shake it up
Now is the bay in here
We gonna stay in here
There'll be no crimes in here
Don't bring your 9 in here
My ladies crank it up
And drop it down and shake it up
Off the off the off the wall
On the on the on the floor
To the to the to the bar
We go we go we go hard
The West Indies in here
African ladies in here
They going crazy in here
My single ladies you should all have my babies in here
My ladies crank it up
And drop it down and shake it up
My ladies crank it up
And drop it down and shake it up
Met her on the walk way
Stared as she walked pass
She looked back at me side ways and said
I can't help but to ask
We end up going back to her place
Wish I could tell you what I saw
The sexiest women in a negligee
Until you hear her say
So They Called Her Mouth A Motor
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
What did I make her say
And that's the reason she cries is
When I am not by her side
I wanna bring back the night and share that look on your face
I want to make her say
From down in Miami where it warm in the winter
On up to Minnesota where it storm in the winter
Kept me out in Cali with my eyes open barely
Got enough work to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you unless you try to
Come around and try to stomp on our ground
That Benz is how I ride
Might get shot on the porch of your fortress
Now they see it was no one from Port City
I run in here and Rick Ross is boss shit
Cash Rule Everything Around Me
You could see me in that Porsche GT
Got enough work to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you unless you try to
Come around and try to stomp on our ground
Been a G in the game now my son on the throne
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
And I like my Sprite Easter pink
And my wrist special par but the mule's cooler
I have more jewels than your jeweler
Touch and I will bust your medulla
Red like red like stop your rumors
I stay on track like a box of Pumas
I peeped you on the phone
I know you're not alone
But I could just be wrong
And I like the way you take advantage of every man you love
But I don't mind if ya come and play ya thug just don't talk too much
Yeah those guys wanna come treat ya right

Girl you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Girl you know that you need to stop

That's why you hold on to everything that pass you by
Can't resist girl one can't lie
Now tell if you are here for me
The way you move got me hypnotized
The way you take advantage of every man you love
But I don't mind if ya come and play ya thug just don't talk too much
Yeah those guys wanna come treat ya right
Everything that you want you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always in the club drunk and high
Girl you know that you need to stop
Girl you know that you need to stop

Our eyes away from you girl when you get on the floor and do what you do
Be sure that type drive a man crazy and snatch him away from his lady
Yeah those guys wanna come treat ya right
Everything that you want you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Girl you know that you need to stop
Girl you know that you need to stop
Baby can't you see this is the way it was supposed to be
It not that hard its easy as one two three
Just say that you love me
I imagine her topless
She might set off my rocket
Attitude like we arguing
With her by my side bring glitter to my life
I should twitter this girl is sparkling
She ain't no rock star
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
She ain't a model but camera's flashing
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
The movie from my mattress
But still she got fanatics
I hit the club with a mug
Like who the fuck is that
Then I hop up out the car
So clean got them hoes
Like who the fuck is that
Tented 200 on the dash
Watch the doors lift up
Some of this some of that
Then I smack her on ass
That's not up for discussion
I been rich since I was 11
Yeah you better count
Convict piece around my neck
I got strippers on a payroll
Don't play around with me Paso
Don't make me have to come
Around and spray at all y'all
It's big as a golf ball
It's pressing against the wall
And while we tossing dollars
They be staring at my team
Track jacket on my back
Your no longer better
Pull up on that trigger
Can't wait to club close
I got swag I got juice
You be running when I shoot
I be shooting where you running
Look you fucking with a winner
Stripping lobster for dinner
You other just beginners
Fuck that fighting in the club
And her number taker her
To the telly get some brain
Make it thunder album coming soon
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life like
And you can tell everybody
And you can tell everybody
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life like
Seems like I'm the only one that you would listen to
I never knew the time that I ain't get to spend with you
Would ever result in you making yourself miserable
Although I knew you was special when you was smaller
And you can tell everybody
And you can tell everybody
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life like
Today I watch over Jeanette like she was my own and that could be difficult
I swear it's so unfair that I'm right here and you up there
I miss you so much now to the point I call your name but you not there
Now I can't rest and I can't do shit
It wasn't your time to leave me yet
It broke my heart to see you dead
Slinging crack on the corner ain't quite the future you wanted for me
I grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home
Taught me everything I've known
Owe you everything I own
Till we meet in person let's keep speaking through my verses for life
And you can tell everybody
And you can tell everybody
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
You'll be laced up in diamonds
One thing I can guarantee
I know everybody all in your ear
Got you thinking like he ain't the one for me
Ain't shit they can say about me
Except that I'm misunderstood
Always hanging in the hood
Getting that money like I should
Come here girl and let's get into it
And lemme see that smile
I know he ain't right for me
But the swagger so crazy
He ain't right for me still wanna be his lady
Hes like the light that sees me through the storm
And I can't seem to help myself
But you turned out to be so unfaithful
How could I still love you
But the swagger so crazy
He ain't right for me still wanna be his lady
The next time you hold me close and tell me I'm beautiful
I know he ain't right for me
Girl I don't wanna bother you
Can I be your baby father
Girl I just wanna show you
I see you in the club
I see you in the club
Said you're so beautiful
I never wanna see you cry cry cry
And I never wanna tell a lie lie lie
Said I never wanna see you cry cry cry
And I never wanna tell a lie lie lie
I see you in the club
I see you in the club
Said you're so beautiful
Whether the sky blue or yellow
This fella ain't that mellow
Waistline makes my soldier salute
High from your high heel game
High heels push up ya ass last name
Lames don't know how to talk to you
Pull any way ya got my love
I see you in the club
I see you in the club
I see you in the club
I see you in the club
Said you're so beautiful
Bad men raised around slum
And I kill people for fun
But when the beef come you run
You don't want it you don't know now
Get the hell up off my ground oh
Life breaking out the beat on the next light
And that's the lowest I go
Relaxed and waiting for me to blow
Cause you don't need it
The kinda drama we bring the one that have your mom hiding
And I can see it in your eyes that you ain't no thug fa life
Bad men raised around slum
And I kill people for fun
But when the beef come you run
Psycho fans prepared to answer my every beck and call
I make a Rhodes scholar sound illiterate
If it didn't it's because the reviewer was inconsiderate
Wrote the classic rhyme and chose the fat beat to match it
I got the matches and my finger's on the gas switch
Create a female MC from my rib
And that leads to ignorant rappers who smoke ooze
Drop jewels frequently at various frequencies
What's the password... password...
You know the password... password...
Cause nobody really wants to hear your corny ass voice
You ain't a MC just because you could type
You a man with a mouse who can't rock the house
You know you never seen no real life fame
Cats run they mouth on AOL
I ah I ah crush the motherfucker
Ah ah ah I crush the motherfucker
I rip every MC on your buddy list
Show the light to you so bright that your eyesight fail
I don't give a fuck if you got AOL or Prodigy
When your only fans are all your nerdy friends that rhyme
Cause you in front the keyboard too much to develop your career
I ah I ah crush the motherfucker
You call it a prophecy prediction or psychic
When my voice gets amplified
The crowd gets electrified
Plus I got the average MC Petrified
The rest have died multiple deaths in they sleep
When in this mode I feel invincible
Bringing true talent instead of acting like Victoria Principle
Study my art like ninjas in judo gyms plus I bring
Incredible phrases Hip Hop fiends are craving
While other heads are mentally enslaving I'm engraving
My name in Hip Hop which real heads are craving
Returning every year like I'm daylight saving
Skills coming from all angles of the atmosphere
Taking rap to a greater standing
With every pugilistic flow another blow is landing
Numerous rap factions have disbanded
As a result of lyrical skills that I've commanded
My Titanic flows they got your SS Minnows stranded
It ain't sex or money so you can't understand it or dig it
Squeezing with the strength of titanium
With jams that return every year like Christmas carols
You could call it a prophecy prediction or psychic
All over your dome like lice mad precise
Leaving crowds Dizzy like Gillespie
Hip Hop was not born in no damn crack spot
Just when it sounds simple comes the complex
Call it a prophecy prediction or a psychic
This is some serious business right here
One of the best to blaze the spirits who lyrical
Summon the powers of Bob Marley
Touch you in the mind like virgins on all fours
Drag you through the streets of wars and give you sores
Levitated evaluated now celebrate it
Found a balance in positives and negatives
People in the party it's time to get RUFF
Lyrical force so strong it murdered punks
The combo of Stronghold plus Perverted Monks
Flavor to the very last morsel
Fell to the various ways that Satan tempt me
Same spot I pray soon that a cordless is found
BOOM BOOM BOOM to the pigs in they hideout
Bricks fly out the whip like any challenger
We need to move into a spot that's spacious
And conjure up a plan to unite the races.
Every move you make is graphic.
Exquisite mentality's a requisite.
And I'm trying to motivate.
There's nothing sexier than when a woman know the state of the world.
I think me and should have a conference
But you busy with your many endeavors
And when you walk away you got nothing up your sleeve.
Every move you make is graphic.
And kick some shit that you was glad you heard
And every time he do the shit sound fresh
Turn methods of meaning intergalactic
So when they grab the steel they tend to bullshit vocally
Check it as this brother rise over these other guys
The sharks swim the other way when I'm in the water
And every time he do the shit sound fresh
And kick some shit that you was glad you heard
Supporter of the cause to uplift the craft
So the average MC can't fuck with the half
Of the rugged block avenger on a mission like Shaft
The current swims the other way when I'm in the water
And kick some shit that you was glad you heard
And every time he do the shit sound fresh
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
It like we could do like a series of those things anyways...
Y'all know the routine
Hip Hop's dream team's back on the scene
What's your method of preparation for this lyrical devastation
Plus my style's been warm
Now I'm hot past levels ever reached by mercury
Hip Hop has a cancer and it's a grave emergency
We bring it grimy plus we save the joint from its peril
And you know who is brought on by the wicked
Now you're epidermis and dermis is like a furnace
Blood rises to the surface
You erupt into a puddle of plasma
Absorb life through every pore
Till the essence of your being is very sore
Stretched so far you can see what's next
The boundaries of your terror
This is what the future holds
More lives bought and sold
In the land of the free yet controlled
Chaos is created as we hunt for security
Search no further than you have to
Watch everybody panic every natural disaster
Yeah once again you work soldier and bust it
You take the western hemisphere
We'll meet halfway in eight months
Your whole armed forces couldn't stop this one man team
This style is type militant raw
I run through your whole outfit without flaw
It's funny how good guy now becomes the villain
But understand we from the same rotation
This style is type militant raw
Organizing a regime to leave your team gory
So is to bomb the population in the upper tax bracket
Final Fantasy Tactics back to space harrier
Check my plan of attack for world dominance
I'm intense beyond your definition
Blow a million heads up without no ammunition
Got many rhyme philosophies but none pollute... the brain
I spiritually massage you to the core
My style is type militant raw
Yo I'm glad you bought this disc right here
I'm glad you decided to join me on
Too much of one thing is not good
Especially when it's some... but we ain't gonna get into that
Right now I just wanna take a minute to shout out
Take the Time to Remind Your Soul about when brothers used to rhyme right
When it wasn't all about the Limelight
You can't Front with your Steps not even a little bit
I did it all for you when I was up for the challenge
It's one essential thing that we got to have
It's one essential thing that we got to have
But let me put you on to these jewels and you can put me on too
World War III is on the brink of reality
You only got to watch TV for so long
That's what I want to see on my TV this week
I like to watch a ass shake as much as the next
But young ladies need to know they worth more than sex
Recognize your worth and cultivate your talents
Remain on point and maintain your ...
I won't buy the rhyme if I think the beats whack
I don't shoot smack or pop pills to get loose
And I don't drink liquor it causes spousal abuse
Plus I don't smoke cigarettes
I don't do none of that shit
But if I do it's just because I'm hypocrite just like you
Everything you say is insignificant
Can't believe a word you say
What you claim you do tomorrow
You ain't doing today
I bet we'd all be your slaves if you had it your way
But you wouldn't follow none of the rules that you lay
I won't do a show without half up front
Fourth and one best believe I'm on punt
I won't hop a flight without the blade stash
And I try not to call women bitches and hoes
But if a ho spread a rumor I ain't smacking the bitch
I walk past her faster than a Pedro pitch
The rhymes are above petty talk and ignorant chatter
I don't waste my time writing ignorant rhymes
I don't do none of that shit but if I do
It's just because I'm a hypocrite just like you
Everything you say is insignificant
Can't believe a word you say
What you claim you do tomorrow
You ain't doing today
I bet we'd all be your slaves if you had it your way
But you wouldn't follow none of the rules that you lay
I roll with a crew that has accurate perception
I don't fiend for attention but I fiend for affection
And that could mean Jim Hats or venue security
I feel for the state of affairs and how it runs
So I blast for my music and for my mind for the fun ...
I'm here for hip hop because there's lives at stake within
I take a slim chance and make it win
I want to grab the real steel and move everybody ...
Without the oils or the natural gases
I bring the facts to the masses to slay their ignorant asses
Never had to bury adversaries under the Earth
And the womb from which I came is divine
It's because of her that I refuse to be misogynous
I'm witty far beyond your schemes
And emerged as the victor
It makes me wonder how a black man could ever raise a child out here
You know we all crumb snatchers in this land of big cake
We no longer supposed to be slaves
Of the time we were great before the self hate
You supposed to fight for freedom not just the end of slavery
So our youth don't get played out for fools
Of the time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great
black man kill himself for limited amount of wealth
I agree with what the dread had to get off of his chest
Bob Marley would be disturbed from his rest
Of the time we were great before the self hate
Empower myself and be my own authority
People die so I don't have to be a runaway slave
The time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great
The time we were great before the self hate
We're taught to worship these rappers and athletes and actors
Many who think they better and they'll walk right past ya
It's what you do off camera and off the court
That really makes you worthy of the peoples support
But some brothers get those millions and forget how to behave
Of the time we were great before the self hate
And that's why the guns burst
Some of the greatest minds on the planet are among us
The time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great
We were great before the self hate
Never trust a chicken who'll fuck your man raw
And any MC that tries to beast me
Strapped up at a function with a vest y'all
And your man look like he don't make over thirty
Just doesn't give a fuck and that's why the Rover's dirty
Caught a steal in Hyannis for two eighty
Or argue about the real rap just because they shit don't hit
And everybody had to peep it
I'm a take it back to the crew and get some feedback on it man
Making fifty people feel like they was fifty thousand
All of sudden in steps a crew
So I addressed him money since he was so distracting
Ripped him with a rhyme that made the crowd go nuts
Whole time Good Fella dropped the beats and cuts
And then this other brother stepped up from his crew
They knew he lacked manhood and professionalism
But this little dogs still jumping up in my face
Whole time knowing I could knock him out with one swing
But if I throw a punch and let this idiot push me
I'm trying to see every single ocean and continent
I might get in a scrap every now and then
I walk away in New York cause cooler heads prevail
Now if I punch you in your face I be raw
Now all I'm thinking about is strangling the show promoters
You might think I'm soft for not fucking up the place
But all I care about is everybody got home safe
You can thank Freestyle and Stronghold for that
I see exactly why these labels sing y'all
And as for shorty he was fowled no doubt
But he didn't get far
Twenty minutes later he was in the squad car
I felt bad for his poor lost soul
A little bit a shine in front of Fifty ain't worth it
If your plan for the night is fucking up my show
A lot of brothers be inside the mental cage
Now I'm off to Jamaica and he's off to jail
Proof once again that cooler heads prevail
Now if I punch you in your face I be raw
I know you wanna step to this kid
Put the signal in the sky like Commissioner
You'll have to ring the sweat out your pours when your done
I fly to outer space and grab a being
Step off to the side to take a breather
And hit you with the dose of emphysema
That's a burden like white man's
Unseen but my mind expands
Known to swell glands of clans and crews
Able to communicate with bands of wolfs
To damage physically with a slow or fast flow
This girl came out of nowhere with a body that glistened
Could of wrote a chapter about every step that she took
When she spoke it was like Lauryn Hill or Maya Angelou
See I was much younger then and nowhere near as well traveled
There's plenty of time for her to find me intellectual
Went in for some sugar and she gave me a kiss
Now she's all annoyed and your boy is frustrated
But we'll kick it with the chick that give it up the first week
And never trust us her because we always suspect she a freak
Now you could break a woman down with seductive tactics
But it always come back on some foot up the ass shit
I was born son of Cameron brother of Brendon
I come from a place that's cold and dark
Where brothers gotta dodge bullets just to make their mark
Yo I grew up in the eighties around domestic violence
But my family was proud so we kept it silent
And I was introduced to rap despite the stormy weather
I kicked his verses like that shit straight belonged to me
All the honeys gassed me up and made my ego swell
But still I rock show after show and never stop
Is cause my people always gave their never ending support
One day when I was seventeen I seen this honey round my way
The way her hips and her ass look bright in my day
My main objective then was to get her butt naked
These joints put me on the underground mad quick
I only wish that grandma was there to see it
I'm the man now and she always told me I would be it
Now in 2003 you'll see the outcome
You know by now that I'm here to make a difference
That's why to y'all I'm forever in day
You all know who you are and I'll never forget it
Ladies and gentlemen... it is now star time
Ladies... and gentlemen... it is now... star time
It's star time time to shine let's begin
My style come from deeper than Neptune
Old school like Space Invaders or Asteroids
I bring the joy but I can also show the heinous
Of your brain in a darker black hole than Uranus
That's Aphrodite blacks rock your afro tightly
It's star time so shine
Shine shine shine it's star time
Shine shine shine it's star time
Shine shine shine like moonlight
My brain cells are large like Jupiter
While other kids mentality get stupider and stupider
Can't rock for eight bars eyes redder than Mars
Put that rapper on the spot if I don't see that he's tight
Then I'll shower his platoon with verbal meteorites
I'm not the type to sweat what the media writes
A lot of kids heads blow up like supernovas
It's star time time to shine let's begin
Challenge my verbal gymnastics
It bring the boom guaranteed to fill the room
With tunes to make you swoon
My extra flavor lasts an extra long time
When I rip the stage with an extra strong rhyme
Just because I mastered the art of braggadocio
Even my notebook scared it ran away with my next pen
Out of control to rule your soul is my goal now
You can't fuck with the style
You can't fuck with the style
And every time I touch the microphone I'm prone to get buck wild
You can't fuck with the style
You can't fuck with the style
While heads get sprayed like antihistamine
I disinfect this rap shit like Listerine
And mop ya cool like Mr. Clean
I make your life full of stress come test
The word on the street is that rap's gonna die
First rappers get gassed and then they jell up
I take you out the frame and have your picture be developed
I can't believe your word if how you live it contradicts it
You can't fuck with the style
You can't fuck with the style
And every time I touch the microphone I'm prone to get buck wild
You can't fuck with the style
I've been given clearance to smash the airwaves
Of these program directors and all of their slaves
I can't turn water into wine
My skills are borderline insane
It's been years since my records first started to spin
I'm from the era where you had to work your hardest to win
But in my heart is the desire to win
I got pop appeal but I keep it concealed
Back home they call me
Move your arms around
Where's the rappers that's prepared to rip a stage show fresh and
You could be a hard brother from the grittiest streets
But you ain't got soul if you can't ride beats
But see I rip it like an old pro
I'm just a kid you heard about through word of mouth
Who grew up in the gutter but avoided the murder route
While other cats were pulling the burners out
The line of scrimmage kept me focused on a finer image
I got my whole life to smoke weed
But for now I know what the people need
And all I have to proof is my nice with the usage
But for now I know what the people need
Move your hands around
Wave your arms around
A couple brothers with talents to rip your brain apart
His show will rock your body from the intro to the final track
We authentic like the Gucci with the serial number
Kick the sand in your eye
Pump your fists like you won the World Series
Y'all to near me not to hear me
One of the only names consistent in the game
Make your moves and get your dough
And count your money and rip the show
And get some rest and rock some more
And make your calls and hit your flow
They say a rapper's only as good as his last cut
They need to step their rap game up
Attitude is similar to Bruce Banner's
Make your moves and get your dough
And count your money but rip the shows
And get some rest and rock some more
Fools wanna know if I'm known in my hood
Stand at the side of the stage and see the total package
Sometimes I feel like I can't take it no more
They put us on the front lines to lessen our birth rate
And even though we all different
Now I don't know if that's the reason or not
When the frustration starts to fuck with your nerves
Veil my brim to those before him
I'm no shuck but life I spear
Want to see how life look from a pier
When you see Big Pooh it's the knockout blow
It's not quite the same as the days of Hit Squad and Keith Murray
Nowadays rappers come through with a brief flurry
But yo it ain't really no need to worry
Instead of the time they invested in they rhymes
That's dumb enough to get the people all on they feet
I've played this sport and now I carry the torch
And a side of sack with it
But I don't know what all of that's about
Got the accessories but all the other parts diminished
I don't know what all of that's about
And send your ass back to your Advil gel capsules
I'm from the land of the hoods and truants
Call me a diamond in the rough
Prefer backwoods to white owls
Rip tracks in your hood on the night prowl
You could never be a contender
You ain't gotta be a Bush about it man
I asthma attack a task scan
Bump you up and braille read you
This is Chuck D. The effects of slavery have had a far reaching
Effect on black people in America
And they still hurt today
Back to how things started for us here
It took me six years to build up enough courage to run
And only six hours to be facing the barrel of a gun
Not knowing if it's the last time I'd ever see my sons
He's threatening to burn me in my own ashes
When the pain that I'll endure is the pain I have to work through
For now my body lies listless
Wishing that my wife wasn't forced to witness
Wishes she wasn't forced to be master's mistress
How did we ever get into this mess
From the welds on my back make me wanna attack
That leads to fatalities
And if he knew I was reading books and getting smarter
It would only make him whip me harder
Sometimes I thank God I never had a daughter
But even if I did it might definitely connect
Hurricane Katrina and her aftermath
Have long since been forgotten by many of those unaffected by her wrath
Once again our people have been displaced by the thousands
And were left to fend for themselves
While those more fortunate were able to escape
Let's take a look at what may have been going on
Through the mind of victims of America's most infamous natural disaster
And we can't scream for because we have no voice
Crying for what the helicopters never dropped us
The stench of bodies in piles is evident for miles
I guess we now know what happens when the levee breaks
For now my body lies listless
How did we ever get into this mess
He sings to keep his mind of the pain of things
Stings like the welds on the back of my kin
Now replaced by the toxic water attacking my skin
I bet CNN is broadcasting this slaughter
I thank God I never had a daughter
But even if I did it might definitely connect
The album set for its US and European release
My pilot like a pirate on the seven seas
Send your chest when I whisper fresh
Make a left at the door if you ain't ready for the raw
Enhance shows I guarantee another advance yo
I rep with the sidestep till the sky's wet
I'm the one anomaly that hasn't been sniped yet
Now we 21st century rap prototypes
Rappers mad at us because they don't do they promo right
We're the ones with all the clout the brothers will say so
Use left arm drop bomb
Operation crush planet Earth right palm
I don't burn bridges and such
The Blast Master has a title
Just nod your head to the beat
Come on and throw your hands in the air to the beat
With flows that leave clouds
You'll ear it'll bleed
Grimy like the city that I'm from black
And I'm back to kick that old classic shit
It's disastrous if y'all have to flow after this
Now just nod your head to the beat
Come on and just nod your head to the beat
Everybody nod your head to the beat
You got to just nod your head to the beat
My man Therapy's on the wheels
Come on and just nod your head to the beat
You got to just nod your head to the beat
Come on and just nod your head to the beat
Or maybe throw your hands in the air to the beat
Come on and throw your hands in the air to the beat
Everybody throw your hands in the air to the beat
You could of wrote me off as some kind of sick stalker
But I guess I was kind of a slick talker
So to not give you no props up on this album is wrong
And all that other shit that I miss yo
And when my people from the hood see me
They tell me that our shit would really make some good TV
It took the tightest concentration and I'm a give that ass a demonstration
And I thought about that
I need to overcome the stress and hold my own weight
I wonder how many of y'all truly know the pain
Of a ghetto superstar who can't afford to ride the train
But yet and still heads say I'm gassed if I slip and forget they name
It's pressure but realistically this here could solve my problems
I grab the bull by the horns and the shark by the fins
But I know it will take longer with too many mistakes
Earth be on my back like don't depend on rap
Son it ain't guaranteed so watch how much you spend on that
So any obstacle or impediment
I treat it as a test to just how strong I represent self
I won't chase wealth but make moves that lead to it
I snatch your girl and take her to third base like John Valentin
And then I'll have you looking in the mirror
I'll replace you at first base like I'm Mike Stanley
You know I hit the screen well
I'm the mailman delivering styles that I'm concocting
While my man Mr. E assists like John Stockton
And while you rock your anthem I refuse to stay silent
Catching opponents in the kidney with the rabid punch
Getting deep like Joe Montana to Jerry Rice
I challenge John Daly to a drink off
After me your career will end early like Bobby Hurley
A combination Willie Mays and Babe Ruth
Taking me out would be a shock like when Magic resigned
I never caught a flag for illegal use of the hands
I got the fans waving theirs in the air up in the stands
I be the franchise brain trust in the rain gust
Go back to the fog bowl when the hogs roll
Been rhyming ever since super bowl shuffle
Ever since the Larry Bird Dr. J scuffle
Yo all you rap cats that do your thing straining
Need to bring your asses back to spring training
I'll have you betting against your own team like you was Pete Rose
Step to the Vick get your back broke like Michael Irving
Before you catch consecutive losses like the buffalo bills
Because me and Mr. E got the home field advantage
With color commentary and play by play
two far a right vision
are believing me or you want to explain it
I try to ask for tree backs here
Just because the things I did I'm always put to shame
So if you let me in your world I promise I will change
Thought I found my one and only girl
To share my life and share my world
The best things always comes in twos
Though you were my baby boo
The time came around to represent on what a man had to do
But just in case you wanna really take a swirl
Don't trust nobody when it comes to my world
For just once I got a hold of my world
There's no more drama no more sad or slow songs about no girl
Then I'd be like the next man found
And when I'm finding out they're pounding on your back
It's all cool baby it's nobody's fault but mine
But I'd probably be sharing it with them
The truth lies in the soul not to save the least
With our heart and soul and a mind of gold
There will never be another like you in my world
And you still can't believe I'm gone
When I think about the lies you fed
You shouldn't let it get you down or blue
What a awful situation is crossing every nation
The people fear shame and destruction
Heads of governments just don't pay I say
And you call it peace
And you call it peace
And you call it peace
And you call it peace
Lying everyday a little more
And you call it peace
And you call it peace
And you call it peace
And you call it peace
Lying everyday a little more
And we'll make you pay for the pain that you cause everyday
And you call it peace
And you call it peace
And you call it peace
And you call it peace
we want it all and we want it just cause we were born
TRUE BORN TRUE BORN PEOPLE OF THE WORLD

You must travel to taste the real flavors of the world
Modified food reaches every corner of the land
Tell me why tell me why tell me why tell me why people can't
If you want the mozzarella gotta come in my town
You must travel to taste the real flavors of the world
Modified food reaches every corner of the land
Tell me why tell me why tell me why tell me why people can't
You must travel to taste the real flavors of the world
Modified food reaches every corner of the land
Cause it feels like protection from above
Many people would waste all of the love in their lives
Cause it feels like protection from above
Cause it feels like protection from above
Cause it feels like protection from above
Keeping alive the good vibe that marijuana provides
Make me smoke it until it done
Four thousand civilians killed by American bombs in two months in Afghanistan
We'll need to kill them if they'll try to kill we
Eyes blood red with venom
But they don't even know I got this badge
That I'm about to flash on that ass like two hits of hash
Peep money on the left got the toast
With exact means to get him
Tighten up the grip and let these hollow points hit him
That's when he show and prove that he a liar
Crime pays in mad ways baby it's all good
Queens like they tramps I rupture the spleens and
Hon stripped and teased made me freeze then hit her knees
Break it down like this
So I guess by now right now you know that who's who
Body definitely kept in
Got this sexy brown momma
Got these suckers live in fear we like three the hard way
Now I'm out here at war and Fox is at my right hand
Now how's that for a twist on the story
That drinks alcohol and blows up drugs
Or even pay admission to go in a night club
Y'all bitches better duck when I cock and squeeze
Respect when the boss say I'm a threat
Bigger and better shows every tour
We want it all so we out for the cash
Life's too short so we gotta live fast
Gotta keep it real get the doe and that's that
Be given to ya deliver to ya
I keep the minds straight organize and raise above these fake spies
And clean you imagination of that fake funk flow
Even when I'm stressed I keep my chin up like Jay Leno
I'm back son I know it's been a while but whatever
I'm terror undoubtedly more violent then ever
You crazy it takes one look you'll determine
That you wouldn't dare fuck around with this German
The life or dead kids incredible Fed bids heroin dreams
And wild schemes my heads deep
My position is far from fiction
I started bitches seeing cream from all these fiends
With large addictions partner listen
It goes a one Mississippi two Mississippi three G
I'm all that not to sound conceited
To blow up the spot like Waco Texas
There ain't no pussy parts about me
Word is born this shit is on in your area
The kid from BK who rock the diamond studded crowns
Like Mike Jordan on this one
Straight out the ruggedest streets
We bless you with the ruggedest beats
To bang speakers through the metro got you petrol
Especially the old loud music
Chop it and make hits and bounce
Who steps in my zone and get clapped like a pawn
Won't see the raw till the deal lest I peel out with the steel
Junkyard shit stay up in heavy rotation
From the East to the South to the West to the North
But out luck in this game runs out through the Carolinas
But the next time I wind strictly dick and rubbers combined
These tunes we perform
When we uphold the pure cure
Needing presence in the present to lift it
Spiritual growth a breath away but still resisted
These thoughts valid for our time
Hear psalms happily sung by the angel's choir
Fire back don't let the escalator backfire
A man born to fight reckless for his ideals
Never at odds with what my gut feels
I rush to my destiny with the speed of the wings on
It gets me to move swiftly
The ills of society are in us
Looking for someone to forgive us
In a wicked world hoping our children outlive us
Some offspring meet the doctor's saber and never the cradle
Most crime stories end as death fable
Realm Disciples struggle with the mud in the soul
Our cold stares are bold
I relate to the book of Job
Claw my way to the apex on knee and elbows
Such thoughts terrifies those
To think with such imagination
Poison in the rat race
A poet of the streets who struggles with his own derangement
The meek are skeletal remains under the pavement
Made my peace with god we've made an arrangement
He won't interfere in my affairs provided I make truthful statements
That translates into people's feelings dead by the wayside
Bruised egos remain when I slay pride
No faith in the masses y'all won't see me stage dive
This type of solitude plagued Van Gogh to hear in mono
Multiple personalities second guess themselves and squabble
A heart encased in cold metal
A stubborn demeanor that makes the bold settle
Bare feet scented with the fragrance of rose petals
Russian roulette with five shots
Soon I'll be at peace with the stress I've got
Irrational logic of the faltered kind
This bum right here's the prince and the pauper combined
This peasant rich spirited
This prince inconsiderate
Divine disenchanted genius illiterate
While the sun's in a coma the moon envies
Happy ball of fire never sees the bowels of hell empty
The witness from above never feels peace he sees
In the dead of night alter boys molested by priests
Pious men behind closed doors cuddle close with the beast
Battered wives raped on bloody sheets
Innocent men of color slaughtered by police
Neglected children starving and thirsty drink tears as they weep
Corrupt lawyers on the edge overdose in they sleep
Grave robbers seek wealth when they steal from deceased
Evil industry dispose of toxic waste with leaks
Betray public trust politician lies through his teeth when he speaks
Dictates the mind of the weak
But the sun awakens soon
I find myself drowning in shallow cup is half empty symbolism
Shame held them captive
Relations go through phases
Nothing new to pseudo bible banger Jezebel Magdalene
Hypocrites to the highest power
Slice of lime in her drink to remind her about her
Bitter life going sour
Where's the redeeming quality
Living life in the fast lane losing control of velocity
Two women with bad self images do what they know best to raise a child
One lives the life of a lifeless doll while
It all began with the crying of children
Searching the cold landscape for something to get the blanks filled in
Boiling temperatures had the paint on the walls peeling
I directly below showered in excrement
Bitterly refusing the recommended daily dose of medicine
Out of the new and old testament
Immersed in a demented game of chicken with my own shadows
Unrest got me biting my fingernails down to the knuckle
My land lady provided me with a patch of leathery
Flesh to keep my mouth muffled
I must repent I scuffle
Of heavy belt buckles
It shall never cease until I cleanse my soul
A dozen picture frames picture frames shattered on the bathroom floor
A spouse who chose adultery over matrimony forever yours
Blood stains the tile
I'm slowly going down
I'm lost in a spiral defeated fetal position
A train of thought with an altered course headed for fatal collision
The jagged glass stepping stones as I hopscotch with wounded feet
Misery serenades me with tunes of mystique
This damning dizziness
In a whirlwind twister raving and ranting silliness
The night the music stopped
And blind thieves with horns watched
No reason to keep up the pace but no place to take
Five they've stolen my chair
Hanging from the ceiling fan
The grief overwhelms I gotta yell it out
Pass out on a sofa bed couch
It'll be a new day tomorrow
I must suppress the sorrow
Or face the possibility of losing my profession
I'll do my best to counsel that dysfunctional family
I told y'all I know the Lunatics
Before Country Grammar before the Free City album
Heavy Starch let's go
Do it like we do Heavy Starch Big Lee
Shouts out to Big Lee yeah
Right on Ali Right on Heavy Starch
I'm about to take it to the street
Pass that so I can educate the uneducated
Orange Juice in my pocket in case I swallow my rocks
Now when it comes to rapping and going platinum
Give me them sheets to say Patented and you biting these Tims and fat laces
I'd show you how to turn that half to a bird
The black Einstein ruled the war never a kind line
Really listening for competition
Should knight go in the door
Big 8 for the track rap javelin hurdle hops
Still got it yours need fluffing this manic
I rhyme graphic heavily tattered shots to ram bank
He'll back small 6-9 erratic
Shot with the Rubes in the desert and that 22-2
Got home the Rams was up 22-2
Minnie on my phone like hook me up with Nelly
And that 22-2 with 3 in it's so pimped out
Dirty let the beat go
Dirty let the beat go
Pussy ain't shit without a brain behind it
Manage Foot Locker so I keep Air Force Ones
She like to ride but she love dogs with style
If you all about your paper then you say
I need a trillion dollars for every breath I take
Buddha 88 man it's still the same
Respected highly on the street
Behind the Cartier Rolls tinted
E'er word I speak I'm in it
We had the guard spook one of my gods then broke loose
We fold up chairs in a tussle
Top down air forces white tank and shit
Style we all that to the back we all that to the back
Red or blue new wall cap
Pause that bull shit you talking bout
If you please we succeed regardless
Shine the hardest and I'll sign an artist
Change them like clothes
We all know most of us love the same hoes
Like Carla the preachers daughter fucked wit the barber
For starters I know both y'all smash
I didn't get no ass so I had to ask
Yep that's him he come to make his rounds
Tell him how it feel ten mill skin found
Beta not continue I can show you how
Don't know what to call me I can think of some nouns
That's why man yo breath smell like shit
She libel to kill some motherfucker
Ali and Murphy is... bourgeois baby
If it ain't ghetto... it don't move me baby
But it's still McDonald's... and a movie baby
But baby got back like mace got spray
Gotta get it get it good and...
Ali and Murphy is... bourgeois baby
If it ain't ghetto... it don't move me baby
But it's still McDonald's... and a movie baby
To eight million copies on my resume
I tell all my people to think twice in the hood
And I just like what they money can get
Ali and Murphy is... bourgeois baby
If it ain't ghetto... it don't move me baby
But it's still McDonald's... and a movie baby
Ali and Murphy is... bourgeois baby
If it ain't ghetto... it don't move me baby
But it's still McDonald's... and a movie baby
Bourgeois baby... Bourgeois baby...
Bourgeois baby... Bourgeois baby...
Ali and Murphy is... bourgeois baby
Thank you for coming out to Basement Beats tonight
Trying to survive through the cocked heat
Resurrect the mind and give sight to the blind
But couldn't get doper than this unless it came through a pipe
Break it down like shop chops and come off like flip flops
I really hate to see her leave but I love to see her walk off
When the streetlights go off I heard shots go off
Wrap some hemp and L's it's gonna be a session
She stressing the fact that we gotta stay at the best western
I ain't cheap and that's on everything
Put her pants to her knees don't take off everything
Sipping on her cane I'm forgetting everything
Boy she wouldn't have been with me if you wouldn't have left her
I left her sexed her stressed her and left her
Lift over some pounds some way my hitters nod away
Ass up face down I'm going to town
Round and round here I go pumping for nothing
Move it one more time and watch my knees buckle
Watch it wiggle just like the Harlem dance
Conceded when she shake it but I like it like that
Throw it at me even harder just to see me react
I thought that ass was a fluke until I went to her house
Like who's trying to keep they composure now
I'm feeling it can't nobody hold me down
In the back side under the stage trying to hit
Let me at least let me go get a condom I ain't trying to die
It's getting worse fat asses I gotta flirt
My chrome shoes went from Barry to Larry Hughes
To drunk and out of town trying to kiss you like I know you
In the middle of the dance floor caught the man's attention
Wiggle Wiggle do your thug's hydraulic suspension
Man this is great I'm dealing with high stakes
That'll make the whole party move
I like all the fly guys wit the rims and the beats
As I dust off my powder blue Gators
And we seem to be a little short
Let us bow our head for the choir
Someone choke the Goddamn choir boy
Complaining and whining dirty you sounding like a bitch
Sleeping in the kitchen
You need at least one parent on drugs to fill half our struggle
This ain't pain it's muscle
For a McDonald headset
Don't visit the place where life ain't so exquisite
Is it hardly working cause it ain't working hard
Thinking damn life a bitch but I'm glad I ain't one
Gonna ahead and do your thing
Without disrespecting the game
You a bitch and you know it
Pull up your skirt and let me show it
Took balls and bats from
Matter of fact you a bitch I took your bike
Complaining and whining
I went from the buildings to shining
Minks and blue diamonds
Now they lawyers and doctors
Mixing it in with street knowledge
Stacey Adams and golf clubs your crew I demolish
You a bitch I got to explode you
Cause the way of my words are put together plus I'm still in my prime
In the Guinness Book World's endless is where it's classified
Created this vaccine like the medicine men
I'm bout to use you for the guinea pig
I got them trees in my mirror so my car won't smell
First Polo shine off the cover like a high time
Ladies was on us like Sean John
Paint like onions make a grown man cry
Jeans Baggy and Starched
That you haters that said it couldn't happen
Dirty Murphy Lee negative a hundred degrees
Foot on the Prowler you bail
Most of my heroes don't appear on no stem
You hop game picture perfect platinum frame
Interior so cocaine white I get popped from fiends
And got to put my hand on my chin to floss my rings
And Gran call me Chris and Jason
Power locks and doors got to watch the road
Got a hundred forty four spoke down in the block hoes
Down the top goes I live a cost and pose
We bread paint leather ravioli
Wag it and dirty I'm with my dirty in the Bentley
Chronic smoke inhale then exhale
Donuts an fishtails in the black CL
I roll with them Lunatics
But what you might not know
Now what's a grand finale
My persona known to leave rappers in a coma
Knock your heart out your chest
Rappers suffer from cardiac arrest
If I'm uncomfortable I dump a few
You knew what time it was soon as you stepped in the door
Don't make me put a lump on your lip
I want it all so give me it
More deadly than the venom that some anacondas spit
Old silly ass bullshit.
And got a style priceless like ice in the chain
You can't get rid of me.
What you know bout chances enough Air Course
Buff they penis soup head still on my red snapper.
Microphones I burn bitches to whom it may concern with this
Gotta learn this is to all my foes
Guaranteed they bring the most heat
And them twenty inch chrome rims sit so sick
Take over the whole nation.
And then you have to worry bout your whole state
We made it now the legacy's forever more
See how you fools respond to these bomb frees
Bigger Big Lee released all these beats
Thick cliques mixed with Big Lee
For the spot where nobody else should fix a hand or word
Blow bolo get fooled around the clock.
You know Stone is known to break them bones
Meet your chick and take her home
Get one chick and make her moan
I'm still alive let me break it down
See the rocks twinkle twinkle right in front of your eyes
I shine brighter than the sun in the skies
Y'all smoke swag weed that's brown with seeds in it
I hustle from first to first through seasons
And I have Ted Foster to make you up.
They temporary like members of Destiny's Child
Man all these questions make me wanna empty three
Whatever happened to Lee
Instead I'm in the Club Gem
Styles still resemble cocaine
Cause it ain't that serious
If you're hearing this
By this bitch Rochelle
She all about the mail
Look at her walk and tell
Bought a fan from hell
That's the truth playboy ain't no lies in me
That's just how it is
But they need to stay the fuck out of her and my biz
From the groupie fest
Here they come ghetto tabloid
I rather swim across the border
A Thousand sharks in the water
Piranha at the Grammies in a Honda
Y'all people need to stop
I think my brain about to pop
Please could you lead us
Use your third to grow
This just a small lesson just to let you know
How could this be all this lust from me
They hopped back in all phone numbered up
You gotta man I gotta woman we can't do it that
I hate to see you leave but I'd love to see you walk away
But I can picture me and her in the moonlight
Oh strict ones get down when this shits is down
I'm a single rich chick and I'm about to clown
Put ya back in and let ya knees bend
Do the monastery go on let it out
Put ya back out and let ya knees bend
And party animals and me being a rhyme cannibal
Created by my town the monastery is found
There will be no extra space to waste
And if you start to hyperventilate
I'm a Wizard like Chris Whitney
Fellas tuck in ya shirt and put in biblical words
Slow up per word and flap like a bird
Let ya body preach like we in church and you the reverend
Ali and Murphy is bourgeois baby
To eight million copies on my resume
I tell all my people to think twice in the hood
The policeman they don't even lie
And I just like what they money can get
Got the D's the beeps and the television
Swing a bow at your nose on purpose and hit the target
A few questions that I need to know
How you could ever hurt me so
I need to know what I've done wrong
And how long it's been going on
Not only will your answers keep me sane
But I'll know never to make the same mistake again
You can tell me to my face
You can write it in a letter
Either way I have to know
Either way I'm going out of my mind
All the answers to my questions I have to find
Don't wanna communicate
To find peace of mind
Flexing vocabulary runs right through me
The alphabet runs right from A to Z
You got my conscience asking questions that I can't find
Never ever have I ever felt so low
Never ever have I ever felt so sad
The way I'm feeling yeah you got me feeling really bad
Never ever have I had to find
I've had to dig away to find my own peace of mind
I've never ever had my conscience to fight
The way I'm feeling yeah it just don't feel right
Don't wanna hurt no more
I need peace gotta feel at ease
Sometimes vocabulary runs through my head
The alphabet runs right from A to Zed
You got my conscience asking questions that I can't find
Never ever have I ever felt so low
When you gonna take me out of this black hole
Never ever have I ever felt so sad
The way I'm feeling yeah you got me feeling really bad
Never ever have I had to find
I've had to dig away to find my own peace of mind
I've never ever had my conscience to fight
The way I'm feeling yeah it just don't feel right
Never ever have I ever felt so low
When you gonna take me out of this black hole
Never ever have I ever felt so sad
The way I'm feeling yeah you got me feeling really bad
Never ever have I had to find
I've had to dig away to find my own peace of mind
I've never ever had my conscience to fight
The way I'm feeling yeah it just don't feel right
Never ever have I ever felt so low
When you gonna take me out of this black hole
Never ever have I ever felt so sad
The way I'm feeling yeah you got me feeling really bad
Never ever have I had to find
I've had to dig away to find my own peace of mind
I've never ever had my conscience to fight
The way I'm feeling yeah it just don't feel right
You can tell me to my face
You can tell me on the phone
Ooh you can write it in a letter babe
You can write it in a letter babe
You can write it in a letter babe
Never stop giving good love
Never stop baby give it up
And if it's all the same
You can bring it on with the ruff stuff
I don't wanna be tamed
I need a man to be a real man
In order of what I got in store
Always finish what you start baby
Your always having me beg for more
But I don't get around
Jimmy has to ride in your pocket
Or lock him in your wallet
I'm keen on what you is baby
Things are always good to have
You never let me down
When you made me laugh
But Don't try to find
Emotions will come into my head
My heart doesn't need to be fed
I've been and seen it all yeah yeah
Don't want you messing with my mind
Keep this as your number one rule
Good loving not always from the heart
Do you really love me baby
And try your call again
Don't be shy just come around
I've been watching you and I know you like to party baby
And you know that that sounds a really good to me yeah
Everybody wants to hang out at my party baby
Don't you know that this is the only place to be
If you wanna have a good time
If you know you've got something on your mind
If you know that you wanna get on down
Don't be shy just come round
Move around and get on down do what you wanna baby
You gotta be good you gotta be good
I know you've been waiting for my party
All your lifetime baby
Everybody in the whole world wants to know

A dream that she's never had
She's going out of her mind
She can't afford that at

She looks in the mirror
Her reflections someone old
She don't need to be told
Feeling a little bit sad

Remembering now a dream
A dream that she never had
How long till she comes home
Trapped to by your love

Listen carefully so next time you know
Grab me by the waist as we fall to the floor
No one else around just me and you
Don't be shy boy do what you gotta do

Clap your hands if I say you what
Clap your hands if I say you jump
Clap your hands if I say you what
Clap your hands if I say you jump
Clap your hands if I say you what
Clap your hands if I say you jump
Clap your hands if I say you what
I know I know I have far to go
Then I have to much to learn
Now it's down to fame
To find what I've been searching for
I tried to ask my mother
I tried to ask my father
I tried to ask my lover
I couldn't ask no other
No need to look upon others
It's for me to discover
I'm not looking any further
I think I've found the answer
Drive the love around
How they're sometimes hard to learn
Mistake after mistake
Thought it was too late
So I turned my world around
I tried to ask my mother
I tried to ask my father
I tried to ask my lover
I couldn't ask no other
No need to look upon others
It's for me to discover
I'm not looking any further
I think I've found the answer
Drive the love around
Sometimes situations seem right
Drive the love around
Drive the love around
Clap your hands if I say you what
Clap your hands if I say you jump
Clap your hands if I say you what
Clap your hands if I say you what
Clap your hands if I say you jump
Clap your hands if I say you what
Clap your hands if I say you what
Clap your hands if I say you jump
Clap your hands if I say you what

Everybody move around a little bit

The rules of love I must learn before I start again.
It's never too late to learn.
It's never too late to learn.
It's never too late to learn. x 3

Think it's time I told you so
An old face from the past
The times we were all mad
Times we stuck together
And times we fell apart
I've realized how we have changed
How much I've missed you
I can't believe that you're here
Remember when we said our last good byes
And we shared our last tears
I've realized how we have changed
How much I've missed you
I've crossed deserts for miles
Searching places to find
Walked through many doors
The place where I wanna be
Can you hear what I hear
It's calling you my dear
I can hear it calling you
Swimming closer to you
Never been here before
I'm intrigued and I'm sure
I'm searching for more
I've got something that's all mine
I've got something that's all mine
Take me somewhere I can breathe
I've got so much to see
This is where I wanna be
In a place I can call mine
In a place I can call mine
Can you hear what I hear
It's calling you my dear
I can hear it calling you
Swimming closer to you
I hear it calling you
Swimming closer to you
Many faces I have seen
Many places I have been
Many faces I have known
Many ways in which I've grown
Can you hear what I hear
It's calling you my dear
I can hear it calling you
Can you hear what I hear
It's calling you my dear
I can hear it calling you
Can you hear what I hear
It's calling you my dear
I can hear it calling you
Go girl with your fine ass
Give me your pager too
I know that you want a piece of my ass
Don't you know that a guy like you
Don't give me diamond rings
Doesn't he know I want class not trash
Doesn't he know that I got my own cash
I know that you want a piece of my ass
Don't you know that a guy like you wouldn't last
Doesn't he know I want class not trash
Doesn't he know that I got my own cash
You want what you can not have
I know that you want a piece of my ass
Don't you know that a guy like you wouldn't last
I know that you want a piece of my ass
Don't you know that a guy like you wouldn't last
This time I'll get stronger
Ain't falling easily no longer
Dreams I dream will at last come true
I will raise my glass to my heart and say
Here's not to dreams that don't come true
Here's not to what was me and you
Here's not to all the days gone by
And to the truth that lived a lie
Dreams I dream will at last come true
I will raise my glass to my heart and say
Dreams I dream will at last come true
I will raise my glass to my heart and say
Dreams I dream will at last come true
I will raise my glass to my heart and say
My words I will whisper in silence I shall
No Hallmark card can spell it out
Deep down inside you know I care
Dreams I dream will at last come true
I will raise my glass to my heart and say
Dreams I dream will at last come true
I will raise my glass to my heart and say
Dreams I dream will at last come true
I will raise my glass to my heart and say
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
On the other side if the world
Alone without my girls
If time was on my side
I'd take a plane and fly
Spoke to you on the phone
I hope you're all alone
If I had things my way
But I can't so let me say
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
Seems like it's been so long
Can't remember where I'm from
My mission never ends
I've even made new friends
I know you're missing me
That's the way it's got to be
If I could come home for one more day
But I can't so let me say
They don't know I'm taken
I'm mistaken as being free
And I'll ever know if your heart is with another beau
It's a distance from you
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
It's a distance from you
They don't know I'm taken
I'm mistaken as being free
And I'll ever know if your heart is with another beau
It's a distance from you
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
I'm thinking about you
It's a distance from you
It's a distance from you
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
It's a distance from you
It's a distance from you
It's a distance from you
It's a distance from you
It's a distance from you
It's a distance from you
Then you call my name
And I know inside I love you
Until you see the shore
There I will be waiting
Anywhere else but here
I wouldn't wanna change
I wouldn't wanna take
Everything out on you
Brush your teeth and pour a cup of
Watch you do that every day
The little things that you do
Anywhere else but here
I wouldn't wanna change
I wouldn't wanna take
Everything out on you
Anywhere else but here
I wouldn't wanna change
I wouldn't wanna take
Everything out on you
I wouldn't wanna take
Everything out on you
Then you call my name
And I know inside I love you
Until you see the shore
There I will be waiting
Something really cool
I got my eyes set on you
I'm feeling mighty strong
As I ride all upon you
Wanna come along for the ride
Let me tell you something
I'm completely different
A funk diva on the floor
I'm not quite like the other girls
Now I want you even more
Ooh you're bad to the bone
Is this where you wanna be
Can you feel it in your feet
Wanna come along for the ride
Let me tell you something
I'm feeling mighty strong
As I ride all upon you
Wanna come along for the ride
Let me tell you something
Fortunately I've been blessed
Blessed with love and happiness
Who'd have known a soul so...
Pure could reach and save my loneliness
Day to day I live a life so full of complications
Sobered by the thought of lies
Everyday my hopes evolve
People fall and lose their way
I'll always have a reason to pave our way
Day to day I live a life so full of complications
Sobered by the thought of lies
Everyday my hopes evolve
Everyday my hopes evolve
Everyday my hopes evolve
Everyday my hopes evolve
Something in the wine
That accentuates my mood
I'm like a child at school
You're the blackboard I concentrate on you
I am certain this is more than fun
Your fingers remove my clothes
Beneath the floor one by one
And you undress me as I ...
And you undress me as I surrender my...
Surrender my body to you
Leading the dance all on your own
And like a dead man I don't move
But it has to be the right combination.
And you undress me as I surrender my...
And you undress me as I surrender my...
And you undress me as I surrender my...
And you undress me as I surrender my...
The day I left my mother and my father and my sister
Looking for a job to pay the rent and buy my dinner
This was my whole life
If you want to make a living
I would listen to them say
I just kept smiling oh help me sing it now
1-2 what's a girl to do I said
You never know you'll never ever break me baby
1-2 what's a girl to do I said
5-6 I'm a getting a stitch
You never know you'll never ever break me baby
I can't believe the way some people want to stop lovers
Trying to take away your sense of pride must be fulfilling
If you got no feelings
I thought I already told yo ass
Now get yourself back into class
1-2 what's a girl to do
3-4 I'm gonna laugh some more
You never know you'll never ever break me baby
3-4 I'm gonna laugh some more
You never know you'll never ever break me baby
You guys thought I live a none existent life That's right
You thought I might not make it on my own
Roles and ambitions I have to achieve
Try to do me you can't pull me down
When you pass I'll do a laugh
1-2 what's a girl to do I said
1-2 what's a girl to do I said
You never know you'll never ever break me baby
Something just crept upon me
As you lay next to me this morning
As you looked up into my eyes
I no longer have to look no more
Has released the woman I am.
Love is love you can't buy love
Cannot lead you to temptation
And should always remain so
Love is love you can't buy love
Cannot lead you to temptation
I don't wanna be alone
Call my number when you get home
I don't wanna be alone
Talking to myself from dusk till dawn
I can just imagine how it's gotta be
But getting hot alone ain't no fun
So I don't wanna be alone
Every night with you is never the same
Every minute I intend to pretend that you love me
And I get less lonely
I don't wanna be alone
Call my number when you get home
I don't wanna be alone
Talking to myself from dusk till dawn
I can just imagine how it's gotta be
But getting hot alone ain't no fun
So I don't wanna be alone
At night do you think that I'm haunting you
When you sleep do you think of the things I do
Do you think that you can commit to my constant demands
Tell your friend that it ain't no sin
If he feels to join in
I don't wanna be alone
Call my number when you get home
I don't wanna be alone
Talking to myself from dusk till dawn
I can just imagine how it's gotta be
But getting hot alone ain't no fun
So I don't wanna be alone
Every night I intend to pretend that you love me
I don't wanna be alone
Call my number when you get home
I don't wanna be alone
Talking to myself from dusk till dawn
I can just imagine how it's gotta be
But getting hot alone ain't no fun
So I don't wanna be alone
Its five the club you still haven't called me
Boy you must be out your mind
Its 12 o'clock I'm hot and I'm ready
I call my girls for a night on the town
And I'm about to let it all out
For the sexy senorita
He didn't call so see ya
She's coming home with me
For the sexy senorita
He didn't call so see ya
She's sending you on your way
I'm about to salsa salsa
So come senor you sexy papa
He's watching me he looks so inviting
But I ain't to tease and go home
He didn't call so see ya
She's coming home with me
He didn't call so see ya
She's sending you on your way
Ever since I was the age of nine
I really only felt that I could sing or rhyme
Making sure every dance step is right
Way up in the mirror singing five star songs
So I keep it real only doing what I know
If you don't know what I know
If you feel how I feel
If you see what I see
If you hear what I hear
I know you like my style
I know you wanna get with me
No money in my pockets
And if I wasn't beautiful
From Monday to Sunday
I'm just working on my beats
So if you don't know what I know
When I see you've got it right
If you don't know what I know
If you feel how I feel
If you see what I see
If you hear what I hear
Let me tell you what other girl bands say
I was the skinny kid at the back of the class
If you wanna piece of this
Gimme gimme the thing
If you don't know what I know
If you feel how I feel
If you see what I see
If you hear what I hear
If you don't know what I know
If you feel how I feel
If you see what I see
If you hear what I hear
If you don't know what I know
If you feel how I feel
If you see what I see
If you hear what I hear
Let's give it one more try...
Boy I will be a fool...
Let's get together forever with no more hiding...
Boy I can't stand your heat
I haven't eaten all week
Got me obsessing all day
Oh what you done to me
Can't stop calling your name
Check me I'm acting all weird
All my girls say boy I'm totally gone
Acting crazy I don't know what I'm on
Baby I'm speechless I don't know what you've done
Boy whenever you call my stomach's in bits
I can't focus at all you got me twisted
I live for that talk when you call me your chick
Just so all the girls know I gotcha for keeps
My coolness is blown I need my fix
In a matter of days I'm not myself
I'm all over the place I get a chick fit
When I hear your name I totally flip
Boy you're too hot for me
Can't stop melting away
When I see you I can't speak
Switching when I see your face
Acting like I'm a teen
Waiting outside your place
Boy this is really not me
All my girls say boy I'm totally gone...
Boy whenever you call my stomach's in bits
I can't focus at all you got me twisted
I live for that talk when you call me your chick
Just so all the girls know I gotcha for keeps
My coolness is blown I need my fix
In a matter of days I'm not myself
I'm all over the place I get a chick fit
When I hear your name I totally flip
Completely lost my mind
Boy you're one of a kind
Acting like I'm a teen
Calling you every day
Boy this is really not me
All my girls say boy I'm totally gone...
Boy whenever you call my stomach's in bits
I can't focus at all you got me twisted
I live for that talk when you call me your chick
Just so all the girls know I gotcha for keeps
My coolness is blown I need my fix
In a matter of days I'm not myself
I'm all over the place I get a chick fit
When I hear your name I totally flip
Boy whenever you call my stomach's in bits
I can't focus at all you got me twisted
I live for that talk when you call me your chick
Just so all the girls know I gotcha for keeps
My coolness is blown I need my fix
In a matter of days I'm not myself
I'm all over the place I get a chick fit
On and on baby I got your back
Just so I can see your face
I just wanna call your name
You got me scared to make a move
But I'm still waiting
Even though the journey seems so far
No matter where you are
I wanna be close to you
Time with you may seem so far away
But patience has a say
I wanna be close to you
I know just how I feel for you
And finally I found a way
To give you all I have
I know you read me like a book
That's why we made it
Even though the journey seems so far
No matter where you are
I wanna be close to you
Time with you may seem so far away
But patience has a say
I wanna be close to you
Even though the journey seems so far
No matter where you are
I wanna be close to you
Time with you may seem so far away
But patience has a say
I wanna be close to you
Even though the journey seems so far...
On and on baby I got your back
On and on baby I got your back
Even though the journey seems so far
No matter where you are
I wanna be close to you
Time with you may seem so far away
But patience has a say
I wanna be close to you
Even though the journey seems so far
No matter where you are
I wanna be close to you
Time with you may seem so far away
But patience has a say
I wanna be close to you
As soon as you saw my face in the video
You couldn't differentiate from life and your ego
Long are the days and lonely are the nights
Not much better from the world you left behind
I find myself looking round in case you're watching where we go
If you do it again your ass will end up in jail
Long are the days and lonely are the nights
Not much better from the world you left behind
I know you'll never see my eyes so clear and bright
You can't keep a grown woman waiting
Boy you can't be wasting her time
It's only silly girls that will run game
With a woman boy you can't cross the line
It's easy if we both want the same thing
Or even maybe try compromise
Tell me what you want
Is this what you want
I'll be happy on my own
The more that I try you take the p
So now I know I got no choice but to leave
Just so you know I don't do chasing
Sweetie you know I don't do lies
Baby I'm too cute for time wasting
You know that I can't read your mind
I'm not really the guessing kind
Tell me what you want
Is this what you want
I'll be happy on my own
The more that I try you take the p
So now I know I got no choice but to leave
Said you should be pleasing me
Don't you know I'll find
Someone else more my kind
I'm too cute for your crap
Tell me what you want
Is this what you want
I'll be happy on my own
The more that I try you take the p
So now I know I got no choice but to leave
Saw you come home early this morning
Don't try to fool me when I ask what's up
Don't say another word before I mess you up
I think I seen her face almost everywhere that we go
Smell you wearing new cologne lately
New clothes you were never this trendy
Could never get you shopping now you shop to drop
No good at the creeping thing baby
Don't say another word before I mess you up
I think I seen her face almost everywhere that we go
Don't say another word before I mess you up
Don't say another word before I mess you up
I think I seen her face almost everywhere that we go
Whenever you're near me
I'm here my feelings are clear
I've never felt so sure
You've changed the way I create
I'll go wherever it takes me
You bring me so much joy
I don't know what you do
But I stagger and fall
Trip up in my shoes when I'm walking with you
Here now is where I see how
My feelings can taint me
That's not how I wanna be
The cause of pain through all of my shame
See I know you'd never waste me
Yes it leads us to here
I don't know what you do
But I stagger and fall
Trip up in my shoes when I'm walking with you
I don't know what to do
But I stagger and fall
Trip up in my shoes when I'm walking with you
Way too long you had me in a headlock
Played my head till I was really brain washed
All those years you tried to really screw with me
Played the perfect son to everyone
Even loved by all the family
No more wishing you'd come home
No more putting on an act
Has to come on back round
So step on up while I dish it up
And if you're now on your own
Wishing that I'd come home
Better take that thought and just give it up
Took me out to fancy restaurants
Really thought that we had chemistry
Realized that it was really all just me
You brought me down till I was really messed up
Had me thinking I was your only one
Took a while but now I finally see
No more wishing you'd come home
No more putting on an act
Every time we're trying to get on through it
I wish I'd never seen you
Doing what ya did yeah when you did it that way
Don't wanna be a part of your whole grubby freak show
Don't wanna be a part of your whole grubby freak show
But I'll never forget that awful day
Don't try to get out of it
Every time we're trying to get on through it
I wish I'd never seen you
Doing what ya did yeah when you did it that way
Don't wanna be a part of your whole grubby freak show
Don't wanna be a part of your whole grubby freak show
Don't wanna be a part of your whole grubby freak show
Don't wanna be a part of your whole grubby freak show
Hey somebody's giving me grief
I'm having one of those days
Something that I just don't need
Today things just ain't going my way
Nothing is working for me
Oh boy I'm feeling the strain
Dust myself off and I'll be alright
Don't stress it won't last it's only for a minute
All good hard times you'll wonder why
Oh babe you got to be strong
Is it bad enough to complain
There's people much worse off than me
Hey can't seem to land on my feet
Feel like it's all going wrong
This shit should make me grow stronger
Dust myself off and I'll be alright
Don't stress it won't last it's only for a minute
All good hard times you'll wonder why
Oh babe you got to be strong
Face your fear don't be worried
Life is too full it could never be empty
Get a better perspective
Face your fear don't be worried
Life is too full it could never be empty
Get a better perspective
Dust myself off and I'll be alright
Don't stress it won't last it's only for a minute
All good hard times you'll wonder why
Oh babe you got to be strong
I know myself and the shit that I do
It seems my mouth keeps on bothering you
Everybody changes when the music's right
I'm mystified by the forces at work
And I'm too scared that I'm gonna get hurt
I've taken every drug to ease my mind
Read every magazine to feel good
When you think you got it all just right
You come along and show me how it should be
I've taken every road there's to take
Found memories I know I gotta keep
Said goodbye to old school heartache
I've been walking in the shadow of true life
I've been running in a race just to win
Backed into the corner of my mind
You come along from nowhere to save me yeah
It's too deep it's gone full circle
I breathe just by watching this grow
The foundation is clear I know
Baby your love is fundamental
Baby your love is fundamental
Baby your love is fundamental
It's a journey that took so long to find
You're the best part of me
You traveled like you read my mind
You came to show me how it should be
It's too deep it's gone full circle
I breathe just by watching this grow
The foundation is clear I know
Baby your love is fundamental
You wake me when the phone vibrates
Your voice sounds dulled
But loud enough to hear you
I'm waiting for this storm to come
I'm waiting for this storm to come
Listen to you load that gun
I'm waiting for this storm to come
My world lights up in a fire
I'll make my emotions clear
Pieces of your words take aim
But I don't want to believe you
I'm ready for this storm to come
I'm ready for this storm to come
Listen to you load that gun
I'm ready for this storm to come
My world lights up in a fire
I'll make my emotions clear
My world lights up in a fire
I don't want to be in this home
I had everything that you needed
I don't want to be in this home
I had everything that you needed
My world lights up in a fire
I'll make my emotions clear
Every battle has a widow
Even though I know I'm dumb
But my heart still loves a fight
I'm ain't going no where
Yeah you got me in the palm of your hands
Tell me are you ready for me yet
I know you can make her understand
Even though I know you're wrong
It's time you end it and just let her know
Every battle has a widow
Even though I know I'm dumb
But my heart still loves a fight
I'm ain't going no where
Yeah you got me in the palm of your hands
Tell me are you ready for me yet
I know you can make her understand
Soaked with rotten beliefs
Filling with loveless seeds
Hitting with crashing waves
Tell her that it's too late
My love is here to stay
I ain't going no where
Yeah you got me in the palm of your hands
I know you can make her understand
Yeah you got me in the palm of your hands
I know you can make her understand
The woman of your dreams has been waiting patiently
Baby when I'm ready I'm gonna make you love me
Come and I'll make you love me
Yeah I'm gonna make you love me
I wanna make you love me
The man of my dreams is standing right by my side
You'll find it will be everything you could have imagined it will be
Everything that I hold
Everything that I hold
You're gonna be my guy cause one of these days my love will be yours
My love will be yours
My love will be yours
Boy I'll be the woman that I know you will need
I wanna make you need
Damn I'm gonna make you need
Promise it will be everything you could have imagined it would be
Everything that I hold
Everything that I hold
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
Promise I'll be waiting right here
Promise I'll be waiting right here
Promise I'll be waiting right here
Promise I'll be waiting right here
Everything that I hold
Everything that I hold
Everything that I hold
Everything that I hold
I'm gonna make you love me
As I stand in this empty space
I hear the sound of my heart ache
Never thought you'd break my heart
Because I loved you from the start
Tomorrow don't mean nothing if I wake up holding my pillow tight
I've been praying secretly
If I bring you back to me
Tomorrow don't mean nothing if I wake up holding my pillow tight
Tomorrow don't mean nothing if I wake up holding my pillow tight
Never thought you'd break my heart
Because I loved you from the start
Every night I have a dream
You're lying next to me as I sleep
Tomorrow don't mean nothing if I wake up holding my pillow tight
Tomorrow don't mean nothing if I wake up holding my pillow tight
I was a ladder searching for a fame
To be loved and to love
To be loved and to love
That I thought it was cool
You were my bad boy straight out of the hood
To be loved and to love
To be loved and to love
We've come too far to turn back now
To be loved and to love
To be loved and to love
I was a ladder searching for a fame
Wished we'd set a way
Set a way to better days
Not to give up but we still belong
Did you ever think we'd get on better
Now we never have to worry
Wonder where we'll be
A thousand days from here we'll see
Did you ever think we'd get on better
Now we never have to worry
Did you ever think we'd get on better
Now we never have to worry
My elastic keeps retreating
Every time I say I'm gonna let go
Even when I'm heading out the back door
Warning signs flash in my head
You're a hazard on a good day
But I still want that
Every time I say I'm gonna let go
Even when I'm heading out the back door
You call and I come running
Like the wind in a storm I'll blow right into you
Come back like I'm a boomerang
Let me go and I'll retract
You call and I come running
Like the wind in a storm I'll blow right into you
Come back like I'm a boomerang
Let me go and I'll retract
Every time I say I'm gonna let go
Even when I'm heading out the back door
Do I really know where I'm going
I don't even know where I've been
Standing on the edge of confusion
I've lost the best of me
Can't find that spark of gold
I'm frightened of it all
Looking for the beast
You want a piece of me
The me that I have lost
Can't let go how I really feel
Take me back to right where I started
Back to when I knew how to give
I've lost the best of me
Can't find that spark of gold
I'm frightened of it all
Looking for the beast
You want a piece of me
The me that I have lost
Can't let go how I really feel
Only the lonely keep running away
Am I the only one that is afraid
And all that I want is to be worth the wait
So I can be all that you really say
Can't let go how I really feel
Can't let go how I really feel
Right now take it to the streets
It's gonna bring you down when we go to war
Make you think it was cool messing with my love
It's gonna bring you down when we go to war
It's gonna bring you down
Yeah you know that she a murder this girl yeah
Yeah you know that she a murder this girl year
Don't you realize ...
I'm a women I know when a girl shows up and she wants to play
Take it to the street
It's gonna bring you down when we go to war
Make you think it was cool messing with my love
It's gonna bring you down when we go to war
It's gonna bring you down
It's gonna bring you down when we go to war
Make you think it was cool messing with my love
It's gonna bring you down when we go to war
You blinded me with loving
That time hanging on my door
You fooled me with your bluffing
Why didn't I feel that something
That alone bell didn't get served
I was like a bull to a red rag
A moth to a burning flame
I was like a bull to a red rag
A moth to a burning flame
I was like a bull to a red rag
A moth to a burning flame
I was like a bull to a red rag
I know you soon may coming
I supposed it turned you on
You killed me with sweet nothing
You must've seen me coming
It didn't take you long
I was like a bull to a red rag
A moth to a burning flame
I was like a bull to a red rag
A moth to a burning flame
I was like a bull to a red rag
A moth to a burning flame
I was like a bull to a red rag
With my eyes wide open
I can see more clearly
Cause my heart was captured
By the love she gave me
We are one year older
And we speak more freely
As the world's still turning
Blinded by your light
When the world seems empty
You will have my shoulder
You are someone's daughter
Join me on this journey
Like a dancing soldier
On the road to freedom
Coming home to hold ya
Blinded by your light
And spend a little time with you
But our plans have been wasted away.
What are you waiting for
Go meet him at the door
So don't keep him waiting
Spend a little time with you
Now our plans have been wasted away.
Love needs you so much more
So don't keep him waiting
What are you waiting for
I know you've been here before
I'll see you again for sure
So don't keep him waiting.
Here's to a blue sky and pastures new
Here is to sunlight and missing you
Here's to the way to forever more
What are you waiting for
Go meet him at the door
Love needs you so much more
So don't keep him waiting
What are you waiting for
I know you've been here before
I'll see you again for sure
I walk along those city streets you used to walk along with me
And every step I take recalls how much in love we used to be
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me
If you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share
Just go back to the places where we used to go
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me
If you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share
Just come back to the places where we used to go
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
When the night has come
And the moon is the only light we'll see
Just as long as you stand
Won't you stand by me
When the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
All mountains crumble to the sea
Just as long as you stand
Oh won't you stand by me
When the night has come
And the moon is the only light we'll see
Just as long as you fucking stand by me
Oh won't you stand by me
Oh won't you stand by me
When the sky that we look upon
And the mountains tumble to the sea
Just as long as you fucking stand by me
Oh won't you stand by me
Oh won't you stand by me

If you want me to do you right
You're gonna have to love me day and night
If you want me to do you right
You're gonna have to love me day and night
I'll be waiting for you
You can put your loving on the line
Take me in your arms and let me know that it's alright
Look into my eyes and let me see you deep inside
I get to feel you here beside me
I get to hold and squeeze you tight
If you want me to do you right
You're gonna have to love me day and night
If you want me to do you right

You're gonna have to love me day and night
As we stroll along together
Holding hands walking all along
So in love are we two
That we don't know what to do
As we walk by the sea together
Under stars twinkling high above
So in love are we two
No one else but me and you
We stroll along together
Can you tell it in my touch
As we walk down the aisle together
So in love are we two
In a world of our own
And I just want to hold you in my arms forever
Can you tell it in my touch
As we walk down the aisle together
So in love are we two
When I don't listen to you
And maybe know it seems that I am untrue
But give me one more chance
And I'll prove my love to you
And oh girl I'll do anything
I'll show affection and anything you choose
And I'll do all this to prove that I love you
And girl you know I'll love you and I care
And if you ever need me I will always be there
That you and I shared
You and I should never be apart
So can we try it again
And make a brand new start
You know I love with all my heart
Cause baby I love you
Now I lay me down to sleep
From all the tears that I cried
When I look in your eyes
I don't see me any more
So can we try it one more time
Before you walk out that door
I'm sorry I didn't understand
So I'll do all that I can
To show you I love you
I just can't understand how come
If I could only tell you right how I feel
I know everything between you and me
I just can't understand how come
Things can work out for us
It's gonna be alright now baby
I just can't understand how come
Things can work out for us
I just can't understand how come
Things can work out for us
I just can't understand how come
So many times I looked and found
You are my life when life was done
Has come to you today
I'll try and be a better man
And when others come my way
I'll just smile and politely say
That this heart of mine
Though in the past I've let you down
There's no more tears I'll be around
Has come to you today
I'll try and be a better man
So let me hold you close to me
I'll make up for all the times you've cried
Let me take you in my arms
I'll erase all the hurt I see
Come and feel the love I have
Has come to you today
I'll try and be a better
I swear by the moon and the stars in the skies
And I swear like the shadow that's by your side
I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure I know my part
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I made mistakes
I'll never break your heart
And I swear by the moon and the stars in the skies
I swear like a shadow that's by your side
Till death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
I'll give you every thing I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the walls
there's silver in your hair
You won't have to ask if I still care
My love won't age at all
by the moon and the stars in the skies
like the shadow that's by your side
Till death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
by the moon and the stars in the skies
I swear like the shadow that's by your side
Your heart is feeling hurt and confused
I won't love and leave your heart filled with doubt
I'll just stop and start over again
What kind of fool would steal your love like that
These words come straight from my heart
I'll erase the hurt deep inside
You'll forget the tears you've cried
I'll just stop and start over again
I'll be everything you need and more
I'll give you all the love you missed before
Time to put the past behind you
Just look up and love will find you
I won't love and leave your heart filled with doubt
I'll just stop and start over again
I'll just stop and start over again
What can I do to show my love to you
Girl anything I'll do
The smile on your face is like a joy that can't be placed
Don't let it fade away
I really don't know how I'm gonna make it
I can't go on without you
What can I say to tell ya that I'm sorry
I'll try to find a way I can make it
A way to go on without you here
I'll time the hours till you come back
And count the days till you appear
I really don't know how I'm gonna make it
I can't go on without you
I can't go on without you
I can't go on without you
I can't go on without you
Now I agree that I never should have let you go
And if that's not enough just tell me I'll give you more
So smoothly lay back is what I'm gonna do
Cause baby I can't go on without you
I can't go on without you
I can't go on without you
I can't go on I need to feel your love
I need to feel your love
Just as simple as holding your hand
I can't go on without you
I can't go on without you
I can't go on without you
Little rump shaker she can really shake and bake
She can work it to the left
She wants to get a little freaky tonight
She's got the potion in the motion
She shimmies up my jimmy and she'll do me all night long
She wants to lick me like a lollipop
She's got the potion in the motion
Work her booty all night long
Makes me want to zoom zoom zoom
She's got the potion in the motion
She wants to lick me like a lollipop

My dear having your love
I don't want to be alone
Said I need someone to hold on tight
Get ready for this magical ride
Helplessly I'm falling so deep
What am I supposed to do
This how our daily life goes
If I need a helping hand I can count on you
Can't fight the feeling no matter what you do
Can't fight the feeling no matter what you do
I don't want to be alone
Said I need someone to hold on tight
Get ready for this magical ride
Helplessly I'm falling so deep
What am I supposed to do
And I've just got to know if it's the same for you
Think you're the one for me
And you'll always be the one that I love
Think you're the one for me
And you'll always be the one that I love
You know I'll always be here 4 you
I promise you that I will never play around
I swear I'm always gonna be faithful and true
Think you're the one for me
And you'll always be the one that I love
Think you're the one for me
And you'll always be the one that I love
And lady you will always be
The only girl I want in my life
And there is only one place that I'd rather be
And that's forever and ever by your side
Think you're the one for me
And you'll always be the one in all my dreams
Think you're the one for me
You're the girl of my dreams
Think you're the one for me
And you'll always be the one that I love
Think you're the one for me
And you'll always be the one that I love
Think you're the one for me
Every time we're together and you put your little hand in mine
And lady in you I've found a lover and a friend
You color my world in
At the end of the rainbow
We found everlasting love and devotion
Pretty lady you know I'm your man
Sexy lady you know I'm so in love with you
You color my world in
At the end of the rainbow
We found everlasting love and devotion
It happens every time that I'm with you
And when you touch me girl you know it's true
Girl all I see is you and me
Happy together for eternity
So many feeling's when I look in your eyes
So all you fellas gather round
Pump your systems way up 4 the funky sound
Throw your hands up in the air
Show the fellas that you really care
And if these sounds are what you like
Some people get up off the wall
104 on your radio dial
With a knick knack paddy whack we'll be getting down
When we roll in to your town
I know I was a fool to let you leave my side
And let the most important thing slip slowly by my eyes
Won't make the same mistake twice
I counted every minute since we've been apart
I want so bad to tell you girl what's in my heart
I want to touch you baby and hold you again
Give me one more chance to show you
Another chance to kiss and hold you
And if you need someone to love you
And you know I'll always be there
Baby I'm here 4 you if you change your mind
And I promise you it will be better this time
Baby I'm here 4 you won't you let me try
When I wake up in the morning
Want you here with me
Want to wrap my arms around wanna feel
Just we like we used to be
You never miss your water
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance to show you
Another chance to kiss and hold you
And let you know how much I care
And if you need someone to love you
So you know I'll always be there
Baby I'm here 4 you if you change your mind
And I promise you it will be better this time
Baby I'm here 4 you won't you let me try
If you change your mind
And I promise you it will be better this time
Baby I'm here 4 you won't you let me try
Too many times I treated you unkind
Now I have to wonder what
The hell was going through my mind
I guess I was afraid to let my true feelings show
Now things have changed because I'm not the same
I've been a different man ever since you went away
And baby if you come back I swear I'll always be true
And I just want you to know I'm here for you
Give me one more chance to show you
Another chance to kiss and hold you
Show you how much I care
And if you need someone to love you
So you know I'll always be there
Give me one more chance to show you
Another chance to kiss and hold you
I want a sweet love like you
And if you need someone to love you
Jesus loves me this I know
He gave his life to let me know
How ever far that I may stray
He's only just a friend
Jesus loves me I can say
He watches me both night and day
And to him this is why I pray
Jesus loves me he's my friend
He's been with me through thick and thin
And I sing this song to praise his name
For blessing me time and time again
Jesus loves me this I sing
He blessed me with my family
That I only could here today
Our heart's and our lives
Round yon virgin mother and child.
Holy infant so tender and mild.
Sleep in heavenly peace
Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better
And as I trim the tree
How fun it's gonna together
The fire side is blazing bright
Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you
Fire side is blazing bright
I'm gonna get to know you better
And as I trim the tree
How fun it's gonna be together
The fire side is blazing bright
Caroling all through the night
Come be with me tonight
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
Born is the king of Israel
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them afar
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Born is the king of Israel
This star true light to the northwest
And there it did stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay
Born is the king of Israel
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
I just came back from a lovely trip along the milky way
I stopped off at the north pole to spend the holiday
He took me to his workshop and told his plans to me
You better write your letter now and mail it right away
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Curly head dolls that coddle and coo
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the holy bible say
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
Hark now hear the angels sing
And man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day
Trumpets sound and angels sing
That man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day
While shepherds watch their flock by night
They see a bright new star
Then hear a choir of angels sing
Music seemed to come from afar
Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Come to Bethlehem that night
Then find no place to lay the child
Not a single room was in sight
Hark now hear the angels sing
New king's born today
And man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day
Trumpets sound and angels sing
That man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day
By and by they find a little nook
In a stable so all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little boy was born
Hark now hear the angels sing
And man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day
Trumpets sound and angels sing
That man will live for evermore
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
He lies in such a lowly place
Where ox and ass are feeding
The end of fear for all who hear
The silent word is speaking
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Let loving hearts enthrone him.
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
Join in any reindeer games
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history
Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in
That old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And they only paused a moment when
Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
I'll be back again someday
They possess a gift or two
To make your dreams come true
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Any thing your heart desires
If your heart is in your dreams
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longings
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dream comes true
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longings
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
I've been gone away from home for too long
I call her on the phone every day
Even though we're apart
Baby you're always in my heart
I can't wait to see my baby
I just wanna kiss her
And everything will be fine with me
I just can't wait to spend
Christmas with my baby
Just seeing you again
Holding you so gently
We're playing in the snow
My heart is beating so fast
I don't know if I can last
Excitement's building up in me
I've got a present for you
And girl you'll get it soon
My baby smiling right at me
I just wanna kiss her
And everything will be fine with me
And I just can't wait to spend
Christmas with my baby
Holding you so gently
I just can't wait to spend
Christmas with my baby
With you in my arms again
Holding you so gently
I just can't wait to spend
Just seeing you again
We're playing in the snow
I just can't wait to spend
Christmas with my baby
Just seeing you again
Holding you so gently
We're playing in the snow
I just can't wait to spend
Christmas with my baby
Kissing under mistletoe
Christmas with my baby
Christmas with my baby
I want to be with you baby
Christmas with my baby
Christmas with my baby
Kissing under mistletoe
Christmas with my baby
Christmas with my baby
Good tidings we bring
And we're feeling alright
With the fellows all night
Committed to a situation
That had a reputation
Of blood thicker than brothers
Understand and we cool
Committed to a situation
That had a reputation
Of blood thicker than brothers
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
In harmony one one family
In harmony one one family
Under the moon of love
You kissed me oh so tenderly
And I knew this was love
And as I held you oh so close
I knew no one could ever take your place
When I hold you in my arms
I don't ever want to lose your love
I want our love to last forever
You kissed me oh so tenderly
And I knew this was love
And as I held you oh so close
I knew no one could ever take your place
Under the moon of love
How can I say how much you've done for me
How much I have just knowing I had you
And I'll never be the same
And know everything has changed
You are the one in this life I'll remember
No matter how far I'll always be near
There'll always be a part of you with me
I hope there'll be a part of me with you
Oh baby just call my name
And I'll hear you on the wind
And I'll find you once again
Just know I'm on your side and remember
No matter how far I'll always be near
And when the wind touches you
And the same star you see
Will be the one that shines on me
I'll be here when you need me
I'll be here any time
Baby I'm on your side so remember
No matter how far I'll always be near
Holding you here in my arms
Your heart is beating fast
And you want me to tell you
Just how long our love will last
I'll be the one who won't walk away
Just as long as the stars shine above
If I had just one wish
I'd make your dreams come true
Put your hand in my hand
I'll stand by your side and never let go
Just as long as the stars shine above
Just as long as the stars shine through
Girl of the way you used to be
You were all laughter then
And you were my light when it was dark
Said love would never end
And deep down you still feel it too
But you won't let me in
My heart falls to pieces
All the sadness in your eyes
If I could only hold you
Love you like I used to
But girl what can I do
The way that I held you close
The way that you whispered my name
We made a work of art
Know there's just an empty frame
Baby we could have again
And deep down you still feel it too
But you won't let me in
My heart falls to pieces
All the sadness in your eyes
If I could only hold you
Love you like I used to
But girl what can I do
My heart falls to pieces
All the sadness in your eyes
If I could only hold you
Love you like I used to
But girl what can I do
From the very first moment that I looked in your eyes
Baby what can I say I've been lost in a daze
I never thought I'd find a love like this till you came my way
Though I hoped and I prayed that I'd find you someday
This precious gift of love
I'm thankful for you every day
Never been more sure of anything in my life
You know I'll always be there I'm gonna love you forever baby
Let's talk about tomorrow and the rest of our lives
Till the end of time I'm gonna stand by your side
This precious gift of love
I'm thankful for you every day
To turn your heart my way
To move you with each word that I say
And I just want to know
I just want to hold you baby forever
Chances like these are seldom and few
And this is one chance I'm not going to lose
So forgive my emotions for speaking out loud
But every time you're around I won't say
I'd buy you the stars
For whatever they're worth
To spell out this love across the universe
I'll do whatever you want
You can swear upon this love
For whatever you want
Just one chance is all it takes
To let this love begin
I'd buy you the stars
For whatever they're worth
To spell out this love across the universe
I'll do whatever you want
You can swear upon this love
For whatever you want
I've been waiting for
In a world where dreams are fleeting
Your love is a miracle
That my soul been needing
I'd buy you the stars
For whatever they're worth
To spell out this love across the universe
I'll do whatever you want
You can swear upon this love
For whatever you want
I'd buy you the stars
For whatever they're worth
To spell out this love across the universe
I'll do whatever you want
You can swear upon this love
For whatever you want
She touched the world with her smile
And paved the way so many times
Sometimes at night I heard her in pain
Though she'd never tell me
And she was the sunshine of my morning
Her cloud of love floating by
She looked up to the heavens one day
It's time to come home
It's time to come home
Her love was always a blanket of joy
And through the hurt she held me tight
She said she believed in me
Her gift was love and it kept me strong
And she was the sunshine of my morning
Her cloud of love floating by
She looked up to the heavens one day
It's time to come home
I have to tell this vision to you
Love like this only comes once
And she was the sunshine of my morning
Her cloud of love floating by
She looked up to the heavens one day
And she was the sunshine of my morning
Her cloud of love floating by
She looked up to the heavens one day
I've never felt this way before
Girl every time I see you
My heart hit the floor yeah
So beautiful what can I say
You're my sunshine on a cloudy day
You have everything I need
And there is nothing more
That I could ever want
If your love is for sure
I keep giving you all the signs
Oh I just really need to know
If you want me baby let me know and
If you need me then you got to
When you do what you do
I can't help loving you
Girl you need to let me
I need to know what's on you mind
I wanna be the only one
Well you can tell me anything
And I will be all right
But girl just stop pretending
And I hope you realize
That I only wanna be your man
If you want me baby let me know and
If you need me then you got to
When you do what you do
I can't help loving you
Girl you need to let me
If you want me baby let me know and
If you need me then you got to
When you do what you do
I can't help loving you
Girl you need to let me
If only you take this chance I promise you

If you need me then you got to
When you do what you do
I can't help loving you
Girl you need to let me
If you want me baby let me know and

Girl you need to let me
If you want me baby let me know and
If you need me then you got to
When you do what you do
I can't help loving you
Girl you need to let me
A love like ours could never be replaced
And all this time I've only been with you
You are the only love I know
And I'll never let you go
You are the sunshine in my life
And one day you'll be my wife
And all my friends wish they could be in love
With someone just like me
A love that's sent from up above
Someone just like you who's heaven sent
Every guy should have a girl like you
Someone so sweet that there's nothing
She won't do to make you smile
And brighten up your day
And every day when I see you turn
You make me smile you make me sing
You make me do those crazy things
And baby you're the air that I breathe
And I'd die girl if you leave
Someone just like you who's heaven sent
Someone just like you who's heaven sent
Someone like you ho baby
Someone like you yea yea
Someone like you ho baby
Someone like you yea yea
Someone just like you who's heaven sent
Everybody everybody needs somebody needs somebody
Everybody everybody needs somebody
I've been meaning to tell you
You must be from heaven
Cause the way you move
I can't deny that tonight I want to kiss you
Ooh I can't resist you
Let me hold you... all through the night
That tonight you'll be mine
Let me hold you... all through the night
That tonight you'll be mine
Let me find away to show you what's in my heart
And we'll never be apart
Everything gonna be alright
Let me hold you... all through the night
That tonight you'll be mine
Let me hold you... all through the night
That tonight you'll be mine
From the moment I saw you...
I knew you were the one for me
And know that we are together...
I don't want to set you free...
Let me hold you... all through the night
That tonight you'll be mine
Let me hold you... all through the night
That tonight you'll be mine
Let me hold you... all through the night
You smile but cannot hide the pain of losing too much
I know your heart's been hurt so many times
And you don't want to fall in love again
Let me dry each tear you cry
I'll show you how to love again
Just take my hand and we'll fly away
Just close your eyes and let me take you
To places you've never seen
I know your heart's been hurt so many times
And you don't want to fall in love again
Let me dry each tear you cry
I'll show you how to love again
Let me be the one to take your hand
And leave you safe and warm
I know what you're thinking
That you've heard it all before
And if you don't believe I mean what I say
Then baby walk out that door
I know your heart's been hurt so many times
And you don't want to fall in love again
Let me dry each tear you cry
I'll show you how to love again
I know your heart's been hurt so many times
And you don't want to fall in love again
Let me dry each tear you cry
I'll show you how to love again
And you don't want to fall in love again
Let me dry each tear you cry
I'll show you how to love again
Let me dry each tear you cry
And you don't want to fall in love again
Let me dry each tear you cry
I really wanna touch ya and lay you down
Massage your body down to the ground
Just tell me baby where you want me to go
And it's all about the freaky things
There ain't nothing that can keep me from you
You like the thing that I do
I always see you inside my dreams
So baby don't be shy it's only me
I know you'll like the way I feel
So come on baby let's just get with the feel
And it's all about the freaky things
There ain't nothing that can keep me from you
You like the thing that I do
And it's all about the freaky things
There ain't nothing that can keep me from you
You like the thing that I do
Fear no more for I bring you tidings of joy
May this time in your heart never fade away
For I know how long you've waited
Just to see the savior
For I know how long you've waited
Just to see the savior
Under the moon of love
You kissed me oh so tenderly
And I knew this was love
And as I held you oh so close
I knew no one could ever take your place
When I hold you in my arms
I don't ever want to lose your love
I want our love to last forever
You kissed me oh so tenderly
And I knew this was love
And as I held you oh so close
I knew no one could ever take your place
Under the moon of love
We gotta few things we need to figure out
Memories of the night we kissed
Now it seems like we don't exist
You change your mind about a thousand times
Girl I know you're kind
Now when we're alone and I'm kissing you
There's no place that I'd rather be
Baby believe I'm so into you
You say STOP when you really mean GO
You tell me YES when you really mean NO
If I'm not what you want baby that's alright
Just stop giving me the green light
Spending hours at a time talking on the phone
Telling me that maybe I could be the one
So stop giving me the green light
Stop making this bigger than it is right now
If I'm wrong well then tell me why
If I'm not look me in my eyes
Like the way you always change
I'm not saying that I'm ready for this thing to end
You say STOP when you really mean GO
You tell me YES when you really mean NO
If I'm not what you want baby that's alright
Just stop giving me the green light
Spending hours at a time talking on the phone
Telling me that maybe I could be the one
So stop giving me the green light
Girl you say stop when you mean go
You tell me yes when you mean no
Giving me the green light
Girl you say stop when you mean go
You tell me yes when you mean no
You say STOP when you really mean GO
You tell me YES when you really mean NO
If I'm not what you want baby that's alright
Just stop giving me the green light
Spending hours at a time talking on the phone
Telling me that maybe I could be the one
Another lonely tear falls
But I can hardly see the page at all
When I look in your eyes
And I don't see me anymore
That you still love me
If you take your love away from me
I don't know what I'm gonna do
I don't know how to live without you
You are the first song
You know it's all for you
Heaven sent an angel to me
At a time when my heart couldn't see
I used to pray for heaven to sent me a love
Cause heaven knows a lonely man can't get enough
But I'd still be home all alone by my self
In a world where the rain could last forever
My heart was crying for some
That's when my angel came along
Heaven sent an angel to me
I'm in paradise when I look in your eyes
At a time when my heart couldn't see
I used to wonder what it would be like to touch the sky
Someone to love me and wipe away these tears I cry
Held up my hands and hope one day my heart would fly
But I didn't know God was listening to me
In a world where pain could last forever
My heart was crying for love
Heaven sent an angel to me
I'm in paradise when I look in your eyes
At a time when my heart couldn't see
With every moment and every smile she brings
I'm on my knees thanking God up above
Just how good it feels to be loved
I'm in paradise when I look in your eyes
At a time when my heart couldn't see
At a time when my heart couldn't see
Friday evening and the sun is going down
Friday evening and the people in my neighborhood
Gonna be breaking some hearts before long
All week long you've been putting in your time
Working hard from 9 to 5 yeah
All week long you've been waiting to unwind
I know you're ready for this
Your love will turn the key
I would wait forever for those lips of wine
This love will shine girl
Your love will turn the key
I just wanna be your everything
Open up the heavens in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me
And not some puppet on a string
I'll do anything to be your everything
Your love will turn the key
I just wanna be your everything
Open up the heavens in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me
And not some puppet on a string
I'll do anything to be your everything
I just wanna be your everything
Open up the heavens in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me
And not some puppet on a string
I'll do anything to be your everything
I just wanna be your everything
Open up the heavens in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me
And not some puppet on a string
From the moment I saw you
From the moment I looked into your eyes
That you were once in a lifetime
A treasure near impossible to find
And I know how lucky I am to have you
And when it comes to shooting stars I have seen a few
But I've never seen anything as beautiful as you
I can't believe that I have you
I can't believe that you're here in my arms
And I've dreamed about you
Pictured in my mind who I would see
But I never imagined just how beautiful you'd be
And when it comes to shooting stars I have seen a few
But I've never seen anything as beautiful as you
I've seen rainbows that could take your breath away
And when it comes to shooting stars I have seen a few
But I've never seen anything as beautiful
But I've never seen anything as beautiful as you
From the moment I saw you
And you tried to not see me
But as our eyes said hello
I wondered if we'd ever be close
Telling me you're feeling me
I just want to believe you're down with me
But I can't let myself be so naive
What's it gonna take to make you serious
Baby won't you take a chance on us
How can I make you feel just the way I do
I keep giving you the sign
But you gotta open up your eyes
You called me to explain
Why you couldn't talk to me
You said that you needed space
And now you say that you still want me
If it's love you want
If it's love you need
And everything that you need
Girl open up your eyes and you will see
What's it gonna take to make you serious
Baby won't you take a chance on us
How can I make you feel just the way I do
I keep giving you the sign
But you gotta open up your eyes
Girl I wish that you would just make up your mind
Baby I'm tired of all your alibis
And I wish that you'd just open up your eyes
What's it gonna take to make you serious
Baby won't you take a chance on us
How can I make you feel just the way I do
I keep giving you the sign
But you gotta open up your eyes
What's it gonna take to make you serious
Baby won't you take a chance on us
How can I make you feel just the way I do
I keep giving you the sign
Take a look at myself
And realize just what I've done
It's not that I'm better than
I played the odds and I won
So I have no right to complain
Or feel sorry for myself
When so many more have less
And somehow it makes them believe
That as long as you dream
No matter what life may bring
With God you can do anything
There may be times when the world
And times when I cannot rest
Of all of the places I've been
And people that I've met
A lifetime of memories I'll never forget
When and where did he come from
Girl I don't even care anymore
All that I know is I'm never gonna let you go.
I can't remember life before you
And I can't imagine life without you
And I wouldn't want a life after you
Any reason to live at all
Since you've walked in my life
The warmth from your heart brought my love alive
And I know that I will never love this way again
That this feeling never goes away
I can't remember life before you
And I can't imagine life without you
And I wouldn't want a life after you
Any reason to live at all
You stole my heart the day I laid my eyes on your face
And your love does something special to me
No one else has ever moved me quite like you do
My heart belongs to you
And I can't imagine life without you
And I wouldn't want a life after you
Any reason to live at all
I can't remember life before you
And I can't imagine life without you
And I wouldn't want a life after you
Any reason to live at all
And you've given me wings
And I'll fly away with you wherever you go
And baby I want you to know
If there's one thing in this world that I know is true
It's the love that I feel when I'm thinking of you
Cause no one can take away someone who lives in your heart
All out hopes and our dreams are alive
I'll carry you with me through distance and time
Nothing in this world can keep us apart
No one can take away someone who lives in your heart
And I know there's a million stars between us
But they won't stop my longing
To hold you and to kiss you
And I'll find my way to you wherever you are
And your love will carry me on
If there's one thing in this world that I know is true
It's the love that I feel when I'm thinking of you
No ocean or mountain could keep us apart
All the hopes and the dreams are alive
I'll carry it with me through distance and time
No one in this world could keep us apart
Your love will turn the key
I would wait forever for those lips of wine
This love will shine girl
Your love will turn the key
I just wanna be your everything
Open up the heavens in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me
And not some puppet on a string
I'll do anything to be your everything
Your love will turn the key
I just wanna be your everything
Open up the heavens in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me
And not some puppet on a string
I'll do anything to be your everything
I just wanna be your everything
Open up the heavens in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me
And not some puppet on a string
I'll do anything to be your everything
I just wanna be your everything
Open up the heavens in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me
And not some puppet on a string
That God would send your love my way
Pray that he sends a love so sweet
Someone to take good care of me
Someone to take my heart
And make it their own
And love only me alone
That's when I found you
And I know that it's true
God gave me you cause...
God would come through
When you're in my arms I feel so blessed
With every song that my heart sings
I owe to the joy that your love brings
Now I'm gonna take your heart
And make it my own and I'll never leave you alone
Thank God I found you
And for all that you do
All this came true cause...
God would come through
Somehow I made it threw those times
You came and you changed my life
And I know that you were sent from above
God would come through
They read you Cinderella
You hoped it would come true
And one day a prince charming would come rescue you
You like romantic movies
And you never will forget
And all this time that you've been waiting
You don't have to wait no more
I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
I never make a promise
I don't intend to keep
So when I say forever
I'll be holding nothing back
You dream of love that's everlasting
Well baby open up your eyes...
I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
If you want tenderness
And I see through to the heart of you
You don't have to look very far
I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
I can love you like that
I can make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
My heart my heart my world
I can make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
My heart my heart my world
I know I was a fool to let you leave my side
And let the most important thing slip slowly by my eyes
Won't make the same mistake twice
I counted every minute since we've been apart
I want so bad to tell you girl what's in my heart
I want to touch you baby and hold you again
Give me one more chance to show you
Another chance to kiss and hold you
And if you need someone to love you
And you know I'll always be there
Baby I'm here 4 you if you change your mind
And I promise you it will be better this time
Baby I'm here 4 you won't you let me try
When I wake up in the morning
Want you here with me
Want to wrap my arms around wanna feel
Just we like we used to be
You never miss your water
I don't think that I can make it...
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance to show you
Another chance to kiss and hold you
And let you know how much I care
And if you need someone to love you
So you know I'll always be there
Baby I'm here 4 you if you change your mind
And I promise you it will be better this time
Baby I'm here 4 you won't you let me try
If you change your mind
And I promise you it will be better this time
Baby I'm here 4 you won't you let me try
Too many times I treated you unkind
Now I have to wonder what
The hell was going through my mind
I guess I was afraid to let my true feelings show
Now things have changed because I'm not the same
I've been a different man ever since you went away
And baby if you come back I swear I'll always be true
And I just want you to know I'm here for you
Give me one more chance to show you
Another chance to kiss and hold you
Show you how much I care
And if you need someone to love you
So you know I'll always be there
Give me one more chance to show you
Another chance to kiss and hold you
I want a sweet love like you
And if you need someone to love you
She sits alone in the alley way that she calls home
She doesn't cry herself to sleep
That she has faith that He will keep His promise to answer her prayers
And take her away from all the pain she feels deep inside
And always be there to let her know that it's all right
Even though she has no place to call her own
She knows that she would never have to be alone
And she will be so thankful for the air she breathes
A family sleeps inside their car
And with their gas they can't go far
They have no way to go
They don't complain about their needs
They just have faith that He will see everything that they are going through
And take them away from wrong and pain they feel deep inside
And always be there to let her know that it's all right
Even though they have no place to call their own
They know that they would never have to be alone
And they will be so thankful for the air their breathe
There so many people hurt every way you go
But you need to try and be strong
Even though they have no place to call their own
They know that they would never have to be alone
And they will be so thankful for the air their breathe
From the people I call friends
Thought my girl was to blame
I blame myself in the end
It's time we recognize
I'm not gonna run away for ever
Trust you'll like it better
Take a little time for me
Things I see in others
If you wonder where I'll be
Then how will you know
That's just one more reason
I've ever felt this free
But I knew things had to change
The revelation is clear
It's time for a cleansing
I'm not gonna run away
Looking for better days
While I take a little time for me
I'm on your side. when times get rough
Like a bridge over troubled water
Like a bridge over troubled water
When evening falls so hard
Like a bridge over troubled water
Like a bridge over troubled water
Your time has come to shine.
All your dreams are on their way.
I'm sailing right behind.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind.
Like a bridge over troubled water
The one thing I believed in has failed me
When everyone was looking from the outside in
I got to know you behind closed curtains
And be the one to make sure that you're safe and warm
How could you leave me all alone in the cold at the door
And now my love won't survive
How could you leave me all alone in the cold at the door
Throwing rocks at your windows
And once more tried the handle
And the telephone's disconnected
No more electricity I'm assuming
With our prints in the cement remember when we were six
Wish we could be there again
When everyone was looking from the outside in
I got to know you behind closed curtains
And be the one that made sure that you're safe and warm
How could you leave me all alone in the cold at the door
And now my love won't survive
How could you leave me all alone in the cold at the door
Your heart don't live here no more
How could you leave me all alone in the cold at the door
And now my love won't survive
How could you leave me all alone in the cold at the door
When you take her out try showing up on time
When you pick her up don't just wait out side like some taxi ride
So if you want her to want you
Here's exactly what you gonna need to do
When a man opened doors
And would give up his coat when she's cold
When a man knew how to romance
Just remember what Aretha said you got to show her
So if you want her to want you
Here's exactly what she's gonna need from you
When a man opened doors
And would give up his coat when she's cold
When a man knew how to romance
Flowers and candies and diamonds are nice
But give her the things that money can't buy
When a man opened doors
And would give up his coat when she's cold
When a man knew how to romance
When a man opened doors
My friends told me we'd never last very long
And I would just tell them that they were dead wrong
They said your true colors would start to show
I said this conversation's over
How they gonna tell me I don't know ya
I don't regret never ever telling you lies
Regret that I ever fell for you
I don't regret not hanging out with my crew
Regret spending all my time with you
And I don't care what all of my friends say
You're the best thing that's happened to me
Since I've met you everyone says I've changed
I don't regret never ever telling you lies
Regret that I ever fell for you
I don't regret not hanging out with my crew
Regret spending all my time with you
And I don't care what all of my friends say
You're the best thing that's happened to me
See I don't miss the single life
A party for me is you by my side
Please believe that no one's more special to me
I don't regret never ever telling you lies
Regret that I ever fell for you
I don't regret not hanging out with my crew
Regret spending all my time with you
And I don't care what all of my friends say
You're the best thing that's happened to me
Regret never ever telling you lies
Regret that I ever fell for you
I don't regret not hanging out with my crew
Regret spending all my time with you
And I don't care what all of my friends say
You're the best thing that's happened to me
Even though you're right here by my side
The distance between us is growing too wide
I'm so afraid that you're saying it's over
That's the last thing that I wanna hear
But if your heart's not in it for real
Please don't try to fake what you don't feel
If love's already gone it's not fair to lead me on
Anything you ask of me I'd do
But I won't ask you to stay I'd rather walk away
If your heart's not in it
You say that you love me
But baby sometimes you're just saying the words
I'm so afraid that you're saying it's over
If your heart's not in it for real
Please don't try to fake what you don't feel
If love's already gone it's not fair to lead me on
Anything you ask of me I'd do
But I won't ask you to stay I'd rather walk away
If your heart's not in it
How I wish I could take us back in time
I can't make you change your mind
If your heart's not in it for real
Please don't try to fake what you don't feel
If love's already gone it's not fair to lead me on
And if your heart's not in it for real
Please don't try to fake what you don't feel
If love's already gone it's not fair to lead me on
Anything you ask of me I'd do
If I was single still I would stay and chill
If I was single still I would stay and chill
But I don't wanna mess up
Won't take the chance of losing
Every thing that I have for a one night affair
If I was single still I would stay and chill
If I was single still I would stay and chill
I know you're hurting but at least tell me that you're okay
Admit to my mistake and you should know
I wrote this letter but I'd rather say it face to face
Winter turns to spring and I am changing
I wanna tell you but you never answer my phone calls
I'm writing letter's but I'd rather see you face to face
Then you can go on with your life
If sorry never comes my heart will not go on
In a story book love affair
And the love that we choose to share
Starts where all those fairy tales end
And I know they'll be times
That I might make you cry
But always remember that
There are things I could work on
There are things I could change
But the love that I feel for you
So If you're down for the ride
I'll stand by your side
As long as you know that
And I won't expect more out of you
That all of us make some mistakes
But love conquers all even when we fall
You're perfect for me
I've been feeling like this girl just might be the one
I'm gonna be with her until the day we're both old and gray
And if I never see nobody else that's alright with me
By denying me the right to take part in his life
That ain't fair to him and it just ain't right
And I know you think that I don't deserve it
Don't make him choose between us
Remember the words that I told you
He's gonna resent you when he's older
He's a part of me that you know you can't deny
You can't tell me he don't ever ask about me
You have to know that it's not a game
My blood runs through his veins
Just because you and I weren't happy
Doesn't change the fact that I'm his daddy
So just try to put yourself in my shoes
You have to see the things we did right
Now let me see my child
His heart fills with hate
We've got to work it out
He needs me in his life
I gotta show him how to be a man
The day I found your love was the day life began
Could never understand beauty till I held your hand
The day I found your love was the day life began
Never knew why people liked butterflies or watched the setting sun
To stare at the sky seemed like a waste of time until I found the one
Who opened my eyes and made me see all the beauty surrounding me
The day I found your love was the day life began
Could never understand beauty till I held your hand
The day I found your love was the day life began
Frozen from all the things that my broken heart has known
Then heaven shined on me the day I found
Could never understand beauty till I held your hand
The day I found your love was the day life began
The day I found your love was the day life began
The day I found your love was the day life began
I never been the kind to shy away from a pretty face
But now I'm trying to talk myself into the perfect way
Of maybe telling you this could be love
You got me so gone that I'm not strong
Every time you're right next to me
I've never felt this way before
And I want you more and more
And you're the one who can contain this fire
You got me so gone that I'm not strong
I've never felt this way before
And I want you more and more
I've never felt this way before
And I want you more and more
I've never felt this way before
The one thing I believed in has failed me
When everyone was looking on the outside in
And be the one that made sure that you're safe and warm
Wish we could be there again
When everyone was looking on the outside in
And be the one that made sure that you're safe and warm
Without a key to your heart
What can I say when I can't find the words
And then you came in my life
And now I am living proof
Of what the gift of pure love can do
When I needed an angel it was you who made the sacrifice
Just in the nick of time
When I needed an angel I didn't have to look to the sky
Sometimes I cry when I think about everything you've done for me
And I still can't believe that I can live my life
That's a promise I'll keep
And each night I think of you
And how your gift of love pulled me through
When I needed an angel it was you who made the sacrifice
Just in the nick of time
When I needed an angel I didn't have to look to the sky
Maybe one day everyone will say that I wanna be somebody's angel
And I will tell the world about this miracle
When I needed an angel it was you who made the sacrifice
Just in the nick of time
When I needed an angel I didn't have to look to the sky
When I'm lost in the rain
When my world is going crazy
You can turn it all around
You're always there giving me all you've got
For a shield from the storm
To keep me safe and warm
For the strength to be strong
For the will to carry on
For everything you do
For everything that's true
When I lose the will to win
I just reach for you and I can reach the sky again
And when I need a friend you're always on my side
Giving me faith that gets me through the night
For a shield from the storm
To keep me safe and warm
For the strength to be strong
For the will to carry on
For everything you do
For everything that's true
For the arms to be my shelter through all the rain
For truth that will never change
For someone to lean on
For a heart I can rely on through anything
For that one who I can run to...
For a shield from the storm
To keep me safe and warm
For the strength to be strong
For everything that's true
For a shield from the storm
To keep me safe and warm
For the strength to be strong
For the will to carry on
For everything you do
For everything that's true
When the world's older
Someday we may yet live
And greed will not pay
This bright millennium
Our fight will be won then
We'll stand in the sun then
That bright afternoon
On days when the sun is gone
And we'll wish upon the moon
There are some days dark and bitter
Seems we haven't got a prayer
But a prayer for something better
Is the one thing we all share
When the world's older
Someday we may yet live
And greed will not pay
This bright millennium
Taking advantage of the situation would be wrong
All the wrong reasons
Every time you walk into the room
And end up feeling like a fool
Pride ego selfishness
Trying to fill some emptiness
For all the wrong reasons
I could give him up so easily
And move in with my sympathy
For all the wrong reasons
You trust me like a friend
And tell me all the little things he does
If you could read his mind
His love is just a lie
Taking advantage of the situation would be wrong
And I wish I never knew
There are times when I look in your eyes
I see the love that we share I see the joy inside
But I didn't see the feelings you hide
And now your saying goodbye
Cause your love is died
And all I can think about is you
The way you say you love me to
And every time I close my eyes I see your face
Why don't you come back to me
Why don't you love me anymore
You know I still care for you
You know I will love you for ever more...
There are times when I kiss you goodnight
I feel the love that we share I feel the joy inside
And now you saying goodbye
Cause your feeling is died...
And all I can think about is you
The way you say you love me to
And every time I close my eyes I see your face
Why don't you come back to me
Why don't you love me anymore
You know I still care for you
You know I will love you for ever more...
What I'm gonna do tonight
I called my boys to see if they
Wanna a go and chill tonight
Now it's on so we're to the spot
Where the music's cool and the girls are hot
It's Friday night I'm feeling good
I cashed my paycheck and I should
Go and spread myself around
Find a girl and get on down
Either by themselves or with someone
I know you didn't come to stand around
So if you want to groove then let's get down
The girls in the place are just so fine
I know you didn't come to stand around
So if you want to groove then let's get
My girl is fly she knows I like
I don't really care if we dance all night
So don't be shy nobody cares
Throw your hands up in the air
Find a girl and get on down
If it's been awhile since you had a real good time
So if you want to groove
Then let your body move
Get into the groove and let's get down
You don't have to hurt me no more
You've done quite fine my love
Left my heart here on the floor
You don't have to worry no more
Know in your heart that we are through
It's been so long since I
Looked in our eye's and knew you
How did it come to this when a love so rich
Cause there's nothing left but goodbye
You don't have to hurt me no more
You've done quite fine my love
Left my heart here on the floor
You don't have to worry no more
Know in your heart that we are through
It's just so hard for me
Sometimes I play this game
And I call your name hoping that you hear my cries
Now there's nothing left but Goodbye
You don't have to hurt me no more
You've done quite fine my love
Left my heart here on the floor
You don't have to worry no more
Know in your heart that we are through
This crazy word Goodbye
Can make you laugh and make you cry
And it broke my heart in two
Another illusion I chose to create
And found out a little too late
I was acting as if you were lucky to have me
But then you were gone and it was all wrong
Had no idea how much I cared
Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
Instead of getting easier
You found someone else you had every reason
Two people together but living alone
I was spreading my love too thin
After all these years
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
Instead of getting easier
I guess I thought you'll be here forever
Another illusion I chose to create
You don't know what you got until it's gone
And found out a little too late
I was acting as if you were lucky to have me
But then you were gone and it was all wrong
I didn't know how much I cared
Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
Instead of getting easier
It's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to ya baby
You're a hard habit to break
You found someone else you had every reason
Two people together but living alone
I was spreading my love too thin
After all these years
But deep in the night it's an endless flight
I can't get ya out of my mind
Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
Instead of getting easier
It's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to ya baby
You're a hard habit to break
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
Instead of getting easier
It's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to ya baby
You're a hard habit to break
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away from each other
Hold me now its hard for me to say I'm sorry
And after all that you've been through
I will make it up to you
Couldn't stand to be kept away
Far away from the one that I love
Its hard for me to say I'm sorry
I really wanna tell you I'm sorry
After all that we've been trough
I will make it up to you
And after all that's been said and done
Like a seed becomes a mighty oak
And a mother's smile brings a child hope
Or ideas born in a daydream
You are so much more than you see
Like the last one chosen by the worst team
You're so much more than you see
You became unstoppable
Even if you gave a world's speed
You're so much more than you see
What you did was so unbelievable
You've inspired us who dared to dream
You are so much more than you see
You said he was a friend to you
He was someone that you could talk to
But for me it wasn't hard to see
That you were spending more time with him than you were with me
Then you said it was all in my head
Just another illusion
Hook Lies are all you ever gave to me
This love that we shared was just to fantasy
Why did you try to comfort me
When you knew that the truth would set you free
Girl I tried to give you all my love
But now I realize that it was not enough
All of those times that you said you loved me
You tried to play me like a fool
Every time that the phone would ring
Now it's time for me to see goodbye
Lies are all you ever gave to me
This love that we shared was just to fantasy
Why did you try to comfort me
When you knew that the truth would set you free
Girl I tried to give you all my love
But now I realize that it was not enough
All of those times that you said you loved me
Girl I gave you all my heart and my soul
And all the love inside of me
Was there at your control
Tell me why you do these things to me
Then you turn around and lie to me
They read you Cinderella
You hoped it would come true
And one day a prince charming would come rescue you
You like romantic movies
And you never will forget
The way it felt when romeo kissed Juliette
And all this time that you've been waiting
You don't have to wait no more
I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
I never make a promise
I don't intend to keep
So when I say forever
Well I am no Casanova
I'll be holding nothing back
You dream of love that's everlasting
Well baby open up your eyes
I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
If you want tenderness
And I see through to the heart of you
You don't have to look very far
I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
I can love you like that
I can make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
My heart my heart my world
I can make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
My heart my heart my world
Show you you're everything
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
And I swear like the shadow that's by your side
I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure I know my part
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes
I'll never break your heart
And I swear by the moon
And the stars in the sky I'll be there
I swear like the shadow that's by your side I'll be there
Till death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
I'll give you every thing I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the wall
You won't have to ask if I still care
Cause as the time turns the page
My love won't age at all
Till death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
Till death do us part I'll love you
With every single beat of my heart
Ooh girl I'd walk a hundred miles
To see your pretty face each time you smile
My eyes on you I thought I would die
Now I'm walking with my head to the sky
You came in my life just in time
I just can't find the words to say
This kind of feeling don't come every day
Girl you light up my life
Having you by my side
My eyes on you I thought I would cry
And I'm still walking with my head to the sky
They don't shine as bright as the light in your eyes
In just a few hours I'll be holding you tight
But I saw clearly on that day
A perfect picture a perfect view
A perfect person a perfect you
And yesterday becomes today
And tomorrow becomes forever
The beauty of you remains engraved
In my heart and mind forever
Yesterday I had the sweetest dream
She taught me how to live and how to trust
Showed me the meaning of being in love
She placed he footprints across the sky
This angel took my breath away
Like a kid on Christmas day
To my surprise my angel is you
II can't believe this dream came true
I found a perfect love
I've searched so far and wide for you
I can't believe this dream came true
Her voice is like a song in my heart
I play it every time that we're apart
She soothes my body with just one touch
I know that's why I really love her so much
She stole my heart with just one kiss
And made me fall so deep in love
Just can't seem to get enough
To my surprise the angel is you
I can't believe this dream came true
The more I see you the more I love you
The more I think of you the more I want to be with you
I can't stop saying that I love you
Then a friend came to me and told me God could set me free
Since that day I knew that God love me
And he is always there
Feels Good to call your name
And know that you'll be there
Feels good to hear you say
You watch me everywhere
And when I am down I know that I can always come to you in prayer
Just to know I can always count on you
I remember driving home late one night
I didn't know how I stayed on the road but somehow I made it through
The only thing that I could do is lift my hands to you.
Feels Good to call your name
And know that you'll be there
Feels good to hear you say
You watch me everywhere
And when I am down I know that I can always come to you in prayer
Just to know I can always count on you
For God loved the world that he gave his only son
It's been 2 weeks and I heard today
You told your girl you got rid of me
Baby we need to set the record straight
It didn't have to be you verses me
But now I'll let them know why I let you go
And the only one who cared was me
Girl I thought that you said that we were through
But you're paging me and still calling me
It ain't hard to see that you still wanting me
No matter what you do girl I'm through with you
It didn't have to be you verses me
They asked me how I knew
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
Smoke gets in your eyes
To think they could doubt my love
I am without my love.
Now laughing friends deride
What's it gonna take to make you see
You're the only girl that's meant for me
I think I'm in love with you
You got me in the palm of your hand
Girl I gotta make you understand
I think I'm in love with you
Saw you at the beach late last night
I've never seen a girl look so fine
You are the one for me
And I don't even care about your man
Because he could never treat you like I can
Girl what's it gonna be
Baby can we meet later tonight
Girl you know it's just right. This love you can't deny
Baby what's on your mind
I'm so glad that you are here with me tonight
Do you think that we could take a ride
And stroll down by the ocean side
So I can tell you how
Can't believe I'm here with you tonight
And it feels so right
Baby glad you know it's plain to see
If there's anything you want my baby
I could love you like no other man
And fly around the world with me
Love you like a Superman
Have you ever wished upon a star
Have you ever listened to your heart
Do you want to wake up to my idea
Open up your eyes girl here's your prime
Standing in front of you
With my arms to the sky
If there's anything you want my baby
I could love you like no other man
And fly around the world with me
Love you like a Superman
Wish you could see how I feel inside
And how you have caught this heart of mine
If you only knew how safe you would feel
Falling into these arms of steel
Soaring across the sky
No one else by you and I
Falling in love's so hard to be
Since I met you my life's complete
Girl can you understand
I was made to be your Superman
If there's anything you want my baby
I could love you like no other man
And fly around the world with me
It's all because of you
I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away now my life is just a rainy day
How much you'll never know
You've gone away and left me lonely
Seem to keep haunting me
That once turned all my gray skies blue
Now my eyes are filled with tears
Soaked with love all my thoughts of you
Now that you're gone I just don't know what to do
If only you were here
You'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine once again
You'd be mine oh mine
You and I will never be
That since you've been gone there's such an emptiness inside. I miss you and
Wish you'd come back to me
If only you were here
You'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine once again
You'd be mine oh mine
You and I will never be
I realize that love is blind
Sometimes we close our eyes
And when we look we hope to find
Someone who's there to change my life
Take a wrong and make it right
So I promise you a love that's true
I can love you for all time
And I pray that you'll be mine
Will take my hand and love me
I can't wait to spend my life with you
A better man I hope to be
Whenever I'm with you
I know that you will always be
The one who's there to share my life
And through the years I'll cherish
Every moment with you
I can love you for all time
And I pray that you'll be mine
Will take my hand and love me
I can't wait to spend my life with you
I can't wait to spend my life...
It's starting with Alley
Or you starving for patties
I'll make that moonshine shit that'll dry up your liver
So you know Alley Life gonna keep that Mary Jane man
I want you to take it all off
Nothing dropped in your drink
It's not what you think
So when I meet a broad
If you straight with that
Come to your spot and probably blaze a bag
I can't mess with no lick if I can't profit
Or have sex with some chick if she ain't topless
Out with the old in with the new
Straight from the streets
Run and tell them new kid
Who this press don't be a stupid
A. L. K. still be the truest
And all I wanna do is just make music and get paid
Like the Slim Shady dude did
Being in a band it's hard to survive
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Get drunk throw up right before shows
Yeah I'm thug and down to throw blows
Cool with it too bound to go go
If I can't get one pound of the dough
Blaze and get laid round the whole globe
Yeah I like women we take the whole row
Do whatever in the morning and go go go
Being in a band it's hard to survive
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
And not salute a soldier
Found you ain't hard then your life gets scarred
Turn around and player hate my... Private attention
They'll be coming through the dark
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I blow nerve gas through chicken wire at your ass
A slow process you must undergo
See if you can bang like this
Sagittarius archers serve as my ground force
My posse on Broadway catching bodies
Can you handle the heights
Start spitting some lyrical shit that I could listen to
Can you handle the heights
Start spitting some lyrical shit that I could listen to
Ignite flows like a candle stick when strictly out my manuscript
What I do for success is considered a threat
So when I dictate my dialect the science is revival
Was in your shoes I would save up some funds
Do knowledge of self then reflect in a pair of new ones
So you would know how it feels to appeal the dome
You value your heart and sole more then your cushion insoles
So I could write you off on taxes every time that you speak
I was born to compete amongst a swarm of unique intelligent emcees
While your destiny is prone for defeat
Can you Handle the Heights
Start spitting some lyrical shit that I could listen to
Start spitting some lyrical shit that I could listen to
Burn them and send Hallmark post cards to the sermon
Dirty vermin with shiny crowns in the Dirty Glove
Words escape like inmates from trapped between ears
Detroit West burglars with murderous logic
Serving multitudes of fraudulent emcees be the conquest
Can you handle the heights
Start spitting some lyrical shit that I could listen to
Can you handle the heights
Start spitting some lyrical shit that I could listen to
But ain't mentally spiritually lyrically physically fit
You are not accustomed to my blows to the chest
I wear you down like post traumatic stress
I got too much mental capacity
For an uneducated street punk to fuck with me
Peep the rhyme scheme and the way I annunciate
You ain't even gotta be considered talented to be considered exceptionable
And every Joe lip professor
Before you open your mouth make sure you can run that route
Before you get knocked the fuck out
Before the power leaves the whole universe in one blast blown
They're submitted for your approval
I'm deadly like feeding ducks at the park pond
It arose and started to eat cruel men
Often the streets they wonder about my musical instilling
I'm medieval a wing red dragon who in the countryside eat a lot of people evil
There in the air attacking you from the East of the Chapel
He emits flame Indian jewelry and after though...
Keep ya hot body grooving
Keep ya hot body grooving
We don't walk just stride
We know how to sell it
All the fellas say hi
Here with all the people
That we're meeting inside
It's gonna be our night
It's gonna be our night
When I hear the dance floor
It's gonna be our night
It's gonna be our night
When ya shake your body
If ya hands are dirty
Then take off your shirt
And the floors vibrating
So if you're ready for me
Come and sing it with me
If ya feel me go oh oh oh
As I slither and I slide
I've got what you want
What you've always desired
Can you feel the beat
It's the weekend oh oh
It's gonna be our night
There's somewhere I gotta be
See I've been waiting for this bus
I've been waiting for this bus for such a long time
Now I don't know if it will ever show
Guess I might as well just take another line
I need to get myself down town by quarter to 3
If this bus gonna show
I don't know if it's gonna show on time for me
Are you coming here for me
There's somewhere I gotta be
And do you know that you have a soul
It's worth more than gold
Sometimes you got let some sunshine
I wanna get off my chest
The drugs the streets the thugs that beat they women
The hate and the violence the guns the bullets that sent them
The ice the jewels the fools that's killing to get them
Or heist with tools strategically placed in their denim
The tenement builders with roaches just chilling in there
The silence is never the sirens be scraping the air
It kills to ignore it but it doesn't hurt you to care
It hurts to ignore it but it doesn't kill you to care
It kills to ignore it but do you
And it's worth more than gold
That are worth more than gold
If heaven is a place on earth
Then there ain't no way a dollar could replace your worth
I hope you know that you're priceless
This life gets the point that you feel like
You could point your steel right to the temple
The capitol hill is the capital killers
Bills passed to bill us back for stamps and keys
The system is so diseased
Ain't a vaccine to cure it
Until we can birth a new nation
Mature it to the level of ancient African civilizations
Half of us up in this nation
Now I know about the hoops we share
Peace to my people who's already there
And it's worth more than gold
I'm throwing it around
The hate you handing out
I throw it to the ground
Never thought that I would sit and write a song to this
But what you expect when a hunger in your stomach so strong
That when you hear the radio you wanna vomit
And when you look at the TV your heart plummet
Sometimes people say things
That they don't really mean.
They just might call you names
To lift their self esteem.
That it'll never work.
Because inside they're trying to hide
How much they really hurt.
But as long as you know who you are
And what you're about
Nothing they say can shake your pride
The beauty you have in you
And when they give attitude
You can tell them like this.
And I think it's about time to tell you this.
I'm gonna be the best me
That I know how to be.
One day you learn how much it means
To believe in yourself.
So take these words and share these words
To help somebody else.
You just might make a friend.
Tell them again and again.
And I think it's about time to tell you this.
I'm gonna be the best me
That I know how to be.
And I'm special and I think it's about time
To tell you this. I'm gonna be the best me
That I know how to be.
Bad times are coming and I reap what I don't sow
I had a job but the boss man let me go
But he gave me my last paycheck and he sent me on out the door
Maybe it's inside the bottle...
And my good old buddy whiskey keeps me warmer than the sunshine
Something special happened today
I got green lights all the way
With no big red sign to stop me
See I was driving over the moon
In my big hot air balloon
Floating high into the darkness
I hope I get there soon
It so many things to do
So many people I need to talk to
And they've all been waiting for me
Well I gotta make it through
Something special happened today
I got green lights all the way
With no big red sign to stop me
Thank my stars for air that we breathe
You have no I dead of what it means... no no
To a man whose always traveling
Whose seen the things that I've seen
I don't know what's yet to come
Not sure of anything that I've done
Really makes that much a difference
Well I hope it has for some
Something special happened today
I got green lights all the way
With no big red sign to stop me
Well I was driving over the moon
In my big hot air balloon
Floating high up in the darkness...
I promise that I'll make it to you very soon
She's a little faster than you think
Now I don't know if she got my number
But she's been calling all through the summer
Saying she really need to see you brother
Now don't that make you wonder
Can't you see you're getting played you fool
She's letting everybody take it as cool
All up in the backyard shooting pool
And I don't mean to sound cruel
You should hear the things that she's been saying
Well the word on the street is that it won't be long
Before she packs up and moves on
She's just using you like a comb
Now don't you think it's wrong
Look what she's doing to you
She's playing you for a fool
Her daddy was a very rich man
If you wanna take my little girls hand
Its downright danger to another
Before me and mama fortune got wed
And I decided what I wanted was the bread
But the problem with having everything you want
So I suggest you take my heed.
And you know that I'm a very rich man
If you wanna take my little girls hand
Its downright danger to another
Unfortunately just like her mother
I'm sure I could turn your daughter around
See what she needs is someone who can take control
Let the girl know her place and how to play her role
Tell her all the money in the world cannot replace her soul
And she need to stop acting like she's 12 years old
I still took his little girls hand
And its downright danger to a brother
Brothers you must proceed with caution
All I wanted was a little dance with lady luck but she won't give me a chance
All I wanted was a little dance with lady luck but she won't give me a chance
Brings wars and other cells of upheaval.
All the men who leave home dying in the war zones
And the women do it all they own.
It reminds me of the ghettos right here
Everywhere that I've been in the is country.
They both got brand new clothes to wear
What it's like to be left out in the snow
The struggle to fight
I don't bye that line that it's nature's design
Your mind ain't too strong
Your daddy ain't from here
And the list goes on and on and on and on...
You never thought that you'd ever get caught
With your hand up in the cookie jar
Playing spades with the devil
You know they make up the rules
You think you playing the game
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
Know it ain't right sometimes
But we running all through my mind
I know it ain't right
Don't believe it when they say justice is blind
You've been working all on my nerves
And I've been thinking every day
I'm gonna give them what they deserve
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
Well if I die before I wake
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
All I want is a different end
It's not hard to realize
Just look into her false colored eyes
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks
You're written in her book
See the way she walks
When you know it should be thrilling me
When I'm with you I still feel real lowly
You don't ever put your trust in me
You don't make me feel like anything
Now I never knew you'd be so evil
How did you get to be so evil yeah
When you know it should fulfill me
You know that it should make me happy
In return you never give me nothing
Here's the news about loving you
Well it's something that I used to do
Looking my heart all over the ground
I never knew you'd be so evil
How did you get to be so evil yeah
When you know it should be building me
Why the hell you make me feel like that
In return you never give me nothing
Here's the news about loving you
Well it's something that I used to do
I never knew you'd be so evil
How did you get to be so evil yeah
I'm able to love myself instead.
Ever since you've been gone.
I think its safe to say
No work coming in so my money's spent
And I still got bills to pay
But through it all you're right here with me
Its nothing more then the love that you give me
Keeps me from drowning in tears
Come through and save the day
In a very special way
People keep and ask me
Where I'd get my joy why am I so happy
In these trying times when a frown is the fashion
I'm beaming like the sun now how can that be
See the answer to the query is very simple
I'm always grinning from dimple to dimple
Because you love me unconditionally
Come through and save the day
Said if I sang a song
Would you fall with me
All of these things I do for you
And if I asked for you to change
All of these things I do for you
Give me a chance to prove to you
That I would lose my way.
And she came right away.
And here's what I say.
I don't think I can cross this road by myself.
I don't think I can cross this road by myself.
Wanted to make my own way
I don't think I can cross this road by myself.
But the revolution will not be televised
And we put the script on you
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
Didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
Go ahead and tell everybody
I believe every lie that I ever told
Paid for every heart that I ever stole
I paid my cause and I didn't fold
Somewhere I heard that life is a test
I been though the worst but still I give my best yeah
God made my mold different from the rest
Then he broke that mold so I know I'm blessed in the name of God
Stand up now and face the sun
Won't hide my tail or turn and run
It's time to do what must be done
Be a king when kingdom comes
Go ahead and tell everybody
Go ahead and tell everybody
I got all the answers to your questions
It's a thin line between love and hate
I'm a soldier standing on my feet
Stand up now and face the sun
Won't hide my tail or turn and run
It's time to do what must be done
Be a king when kingdom comes
Go ahead and tell everybody
Go ahead and tell everybody
Go ahead and tell everybody what I'm saying y'all
Go ahead and tell everybody what I'm saying y'all
Go ahead and tell everybody
Go ahead and tell everybody
Go ahead and tell everybody

No jobs to occupy my time
What else you expect me to do except crime It ain't stealing if it's something I just find Refuse to lose with this trouble on my mind
Johnny Law come knocking at my door
But the police don't scare me anymore
I've been in that back seat so many times before
I don't want no more trouble from these fellas no more
Broken hearts everywhere
From stepping on love we don't care
Somebody tell me what we gonna do
Even though it's plenty to share
People hungry in the streets life just ain't fair
But you never think about it until it's you
Now I'm gonna say how I feel
And what I wanna say is love is the only thing that's real
Now I'm gonna tell you what to do
Just believe that love is the only thing we have that's true
Love is the answer to the questions in your mind
If you looking it's the answer that you'll find
It's the only thing that everybody needs
It's the only thing that makes us truly free
Friends nowhere to be found
To help you when you are down
But you know that you're the one to blame
We know what's wrong from what's right
Nobody wins in a fight but still we play the game
Love is the answer to the questions in your mind
If you looking it's the answer that you'll find
It's the only thing that everybody needs
It's the only thing that makes us truly free
Just look around the whole wide world
So many beautiful things to see
All I know for sure is that nothing is forever
And all that matters is how we get along together
Life is harder every day that I get older
I hope I figure out why I'm here before it's over
And I've had those days where trying to make money was a waste of my time
I've had shiny brand new leather penny loafers
All I know for sure is that nothing is forever
And all that matters is how we get along together
Been from five star hotels to cockroach motels
And Rodeo Drive retail to thrift store resale
I wanna be with you I wanna be with you I wanna be with you I wanna be with you
When I'm looking up at the stars I often wonder why
You're sitting here with me and not up in the sky
But I ain't gonna complain I got myself a good thing
There ain't no doubt about it I'm addicted your drug
No I can't go without it
I'm a fiend for your sweet love
When I'm driving my car I don't wanna get too far
So I put your pretty picture on my steering wheel Now when I'm rolling I'm enjoying the view
When I'm old and gray
Until the pigs learn to fly
Until politicians stop telling lies I wanna be with you
Until hell freezes over
Until tiger blood gets sober I wanna be with you
Come on lift your spirit
To all the good times
And just remember it ain't where you're from it's where you're at
It ain't who you know
It's whose got your back
Here's a friend someone who drops in
Or a face on a telephone screen
When my chips are down and I'm feeling low
Who's gonna help me stand on my feet after I fall
So ladies and gentleman and boys and girls
This one goes out to the people who helped me most in the world
To all the good times
It ain't where you're from it's where you're at
It ain't who you know it's whose got your back
It ain't where you're from it's where you're at
And whose got your back
It ain't who you know but who knows you
And whose got your back
I told my secret to a friend I thought I could trust
He swore he'll keep it on his momma and the Lord above
All the time I've come to find my business all in the street
I still try to forgive that low down double crossed nerdy G
So ladies and gentleman and boys and girls
This one goes out to the people
Who helped me most in the world
Hey brothers and sisters
I dedicate this to the people whose down since way back when
To all the good times
And just remember it ain't where you're from it's where you're at
It ain't who you know but who knows you and whose got your back
It ain't where you're from it's where you're at
And whose got your back
It ain't who you know but who knows you and whose got your back
It ain't where you're from it's where you're at
And whose got your back
After everything we have been through and what's to come
For every time that you called that I didn't answer
I want to take this moment that I've got the chance to
For the whole world to see
In my red velvet seat
You can sit next to me
Got a bouquet of lilies and daisies and roses
In my red velvet seat
A box of chocolates and a little champagne
And that you want to be
In my red velvet seat
You can sit next to me
Got a bouquet of lilies and daisies and roses
In my red velvet seat
Girl close your eyes and open your ears
Let the sound of the city ease your fears
This carriage is made for king and queen
You can have everything that you dream
In my red velvet seat
You can have anything
Shoot the sun until the sky is black
Now I don't know if the sun got rhythm
In the nighttime I'm camouflage
But girl I wanna know if you can move like this
But I wanna know what your name is
Gonna make me fall in love with you
If you keep on shaking your hips
I know you think that you can move
But can you groove the way I groove
Shoot the moon until the night is gone
I sure hope that moon got rhythm
He should know that the day is mine
I know you think that you can move
But can you groove the way I groove
Come along and dance with me
I know you think that you can move
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep your calm and carry on
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
The sun may never rise again
The question ain't if but when
The see will boil and the sky will fall
The sun may never rise again
The silent war has begun
We're staring down a loaded gun
No refuge found on solid ground
This human race can't be won
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep your calm and carry on
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
And it's about to explode
They're reaching in my pockets again
The ice we're standing on is thin
Making plans with greedy hands
They're reaching in my pockets again
The future is a dying art
Laying in a ditch in the dark
The beating of a broken heart
Don't wait to say goodbye
You're running out of time
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep your calm and carry on
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
And it's about to explode
And it's about to explode
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
And it don't care what side you're on
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep your calm and carry on
You think you're so sophisticated
Your life is so complicated
You're looking through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe
Through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe
I remember the things you hated
The people that smiled and cheated

And in nine months she'll have the number 5
She only need one thing to survive
She gives them how is she traps it low
And you know how the story goes
Don't chase the money
And the money don't run
And leave dirty messages on my phone
When I come home they're at my door
Telling me they the one they're looking for
When I'm on stage all the ladies scream
But all I'm thinking of is fairy creeps
Don't chase the money
And the money don't run
The teller told me I was overdrawn
Sorry Ms. Perfect but your money gone
Sorry if you're flat but your money's gone
Now I got to forward and get my payment on
Don't chase the money
And the money don't run
Said the money don't run
Don't chase the money

Don't chase the money
You can't chase the money
Don't go chasing the money

The hand is quicker than the eye
And sometimes the truth ain't no better than the lie
One day you on top of the world and the next day you're on the ground
I was the one that all of the ladies wanted to see
And I was the one all the fellas wanted to be
The hand is quicker than the eye
And sometimes the truth ain't no better than the lie
But the hand is quicker than the eye
Sometimes the truth ain't no better than the lie
Are you waiting for something better
You think something gonna come your way
You never was gonna stick around
You never meant to stay
I see you looking and you keep on staring at the front door
But I hope you find what you're looking for
The hand is quicker than the eye
The truth ain't no better than the lie
I thought you were my lover
I thought you were my friend
How dare you find a lover
You used to call me sweetheart
You used to hold my head
You'll get what's coming to you
I'll get my sweet revenge
Sometimes you'll find the situation ain't exactly what is meant to be
You can't always believe in what you hear and everything that you see
Keep your dear friends close and your enemies even closer
Because not everything is gonna turn how you figuring that it's supposed to
The hand is quicker than the eye
Where will I be without the pillow on my bed
Where will I be without the roof over my head
So thankful for the prayers that you sent
When I need someone I can depend on
When I need a little help looking my lights on
When I need someone to call
You was the one that everyone could trust
You were the only one who would always keep in touch
I remember all the times you sent a letter just because
All the times you would take to show a little extra love
When I need someone I can depend on
When I need a little help looking my lights on
When I need someone to call
How can I thank you for opening your heart
You were gone but you had a brand new start
Now I sing a song to the world in your honor
Go ahead and tell everybody

Paid for every heart that I ever stole

You see what you believe
Through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe
Through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe
Through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe
Through the eyes of a child
Through the eyes of a child
This is dedicated to the number one thing in my life
So close to me that you could call it my wife
It's dedicated to the one that I wake with and sleep with
Every morning I get up and I brush my teeth with
The one I sip tea with and used to climb trees with
Dedicated to the one I fell out of them trees with
One love to the thing that kept me most out of trouble
Invested time and effort and it paid back double
I dedicate this to the culture and people and the music
Dedicated to the old school it just don't stop
This is a dedication to hip hop
We battle for beef but always leave the street with a pound
Taking the crown for the fame and representing the name
Late night meet at the tracks to rock the Santa Fe train
Pull out your sketch or freestyle it if you think you got game
Don't even wait for it to dry just take a flick and be out quick
Make it to Unity before the line gets too thick
Back in the day it used to be a Lincoln just to get in
Nowadays you lucky if less then ten
Meet my boys on the inside greet them with hip hop salutations
Made up of hand shake combinations
Looking for the spot where the circle is formulating
The true essence a symbol of the hip hop nation.
I don't know what life would be like without hip hop
Without the kick and the snare without the pop lock
Without the chirp and the flare without the up rock
Without the fist pump and head bop when dope beats drop
I don't know what I would do without a microphone
Without the underground spots and feedback tones
Without the different crews that be representing in every zone
I don't know what I would be without the culture
Without the battle between east and west coasters
I don't know where we would be without the beat box
With the music I play
So I just gotta be strong and keep moving on with it
With refined rhymes like diamonds that shine
With a pen to make you see clearly my troubles
All of my trifles the pressures that try to stifle
Simply to let my music reach to every country
Where scholars will translate it on scrolls and archive it
Where students in the classrooms of history relive it
After it leaves my hand to the ink on the papyrus
And after I been on the stage and let the lyric fathom bust
Dropping like a bomb on the planet it's the verbal atomic
They say it's gonna stop
Got people telling me I'm wasting my time and that
I don't believe it though all my life I seen it grow so I
That I be hearing from all the haters and perpetrators
So everything they say
Is just a bucket lies to get me out the way
With knowledge to share and thoughts to digest
One of the freshest in the land of the west
I measure it with message and who spit it the best
Follow the quest like I'm the last man searching for a companion
Because when I'm dead and gone my books will still be standing
Out of the polluted skies full of California dreams
People running at full speed and running out of the steam
On the fruits of the earth and give generous
But really men are just animals and like cannibals we been in lust
This is just my way of life and
I got a call from my girl last week
She telling me about that time of the month and how it may not come
Dropped the phone right before she said I might have a son
And I started asking God how come
Trying to hit reset knee deep in debt
Trying to figure how to feed a mouth that ain't got teeth yet
How the hell am I gonna show a child to be a man
But last year I was just in cuffs
I'm looking down at my stomach and mine is grumbling too
Won't somebody show me there's a few things my poppa never told me
It's a few things my momma never told me to mold me
But her soul is so golden the way she floss it
And I ain't mad at their secrets though
It's a hard sell to tell a young child about your deepest low
But I done seen through they weakness so
I understand a little bit on how the defeat can slow
And everyday gets colder when the breezes blow
Have patience some things take time
Lift the soul when you crying till you reach the gates of heaven
Like your chariot is carrying children who going blind
Believe in everything that you doing and just like that
It's bright enough to spread grace over a million graves
Over a million slaves to bring honor to the elders
Who held us away from danger when the danger would have killed us
They never failed us but they souls have peace
Without rolling through Beverly Hills
I don't need weed to ease me when I'm stressing for real
I just close my eyes and try to think how heaven feels
How to shoot fools and take their dough from them
That's why I try to give my soul to them in lyrics I spit
They're getting sick and tired of fighting over serial gifts
In the guns and the women and the fun living in cribs in the burbs
The ticket and they get it and run with it
To play straight by the rules
I'm trying to stay out the news
And make cake to buy food
Fuck jewels I think my soul glows bright enough
And fuck whips I learn more when I ride the bus
And fuck gold it's bad enough that we fight for bucks
And fuck hoes cause in the end I need a wife to love
Plus heaven is the life for us so God
Because the weather man said that you have to have one at all times
Because it's going to rain cats and dogs
See it in my liner notes
The kind of ideas make it seem like the thoughts took 365 nights
I picture the high life
They say old soul with kids energy
Steals off of my torso with enemies
Seems the only safe place is Venice Beach
Try to write my songs
Shine lights but the night is gone
Daybreak becomes the encore
Can't tell the day to stay because I'm on tour
I grew up with nervous skaters
Some headed for greatness
Others served as waiters
Steel that ain't stainless
It's back to the beach bitch where Miss Taylor raised him
Stems from the Norse mythology
Cats were believed to represent the wind
And dogs represented rain
Different animals represented different weather
From the sky to the sea to the air that we breathe
From the depths of the earth to the stars
Run like you're born to fly
Live like you'll never die
Dare what you dare to dream
And everything in between
Looking at the endless star filled sky
Sing out your bed and cry
Under the stage and sky
United we feel inside
I am the best rapper alive
Sombre nouvelle est ma RS
Te mets pas en bikini
When the bullet leaves a barrel you can't take it back
That's why you shouldn't give no ammo to a crazy man
I see the long arm of the law is just a shaky hand
Piggies defined as lions make me laugh
If I run away from one I make police sweat
And if their station blows up then I'm to blame
To me a cop is nothing but a damn fool
With a blue suit full of shit like a bag or fast food
Take that blue suit off son and put on some pink
Cause music was all that I had
On all the music that I be mixing
Yeah I can rap and I can sing
Go ahead and give me a ring
I can make a beat for you in 10 minutes or less
Then Ill have you all stressed
Go ahead give me a test
I don't need no one to make my music
And to those who have money
But wouldn't bring me up
Now can you tell me what
Is with blood sweat and tears
Make you love what you hear
Letting no one in this world
Still be in your town
Bump this shit in your stereo
You gonna go hysterical
Who said they put my foot in the door
Now it's me they ignore
And I didn't know what was in store
They told me I was worth
They said that I deserved my big change
So I signed a contract
Now I'm set 10 years in advanced
To those who don't give a suck
Now can you please tell me what
Plea the fifth no perjury
Haters beware haters be scared
I like it when you lick right here
I like it when you touch right there
I like it when you run your fingers through my hair
Oh you do it so right
The way you hold on me we don't ever have time to fight everything is so
I like it when you lay me on the center sheet the way you pull on me the way
And boy don't even try lie
Seen you at the hotel
It's time for me to say bye bye
Is play game with my mind
But boy I don't play games
For the simple fact that
I don't have the time
I kept it real with you
But you didn't keep it real with me
So here's the keys to your car
I think it's time for you to leave
You tell me to call you
But you ain't ever home
Tell me hit you on your cellular
But your cellular ain't ever on
Who would be by your side
But I got sick and tired
So you want me to be your second Ms.
It wanna turn around and hate a fool well while you slay me I'll slay you so
When I will show you exactly how I feel here's the keys get in your ride take
Take your key get in your ride
Ya better open up your ears and
Oh you think this is a joke
No ooh whoa whoa whoa whoa no
Took away my pain and gave me your smile
And then one day I realized
That you were the one for me
And I'll get on both my knees and I'll beg you please
I wish that I could turn back the hands of time
If I had to die a thousand times a day
The pain that I have given you away
And boy don't even try lie
Seen you at the hotel
It's time for me to say bye bye
Is play game with my mind
But boy I don't play games
For the simple fact that
I don't have the time

Oh you think this is a joke
No ooh whoa whoa whoa whoa no
If you down we can split
I guarantee that you can feel it
Giving you all my warm embraces
And if I give them to you
I guarantee they won't be wasted
Touch on your face wit my fingertips
Kiss you all over your body
I whisper little things in your ear
Tell you all the little things
That you love and deserve to hear
I'm always looking in your pretty eyes
Telling you I love you
When I tell the other fellows lies
And that's the way it's always gonna be
And you don't even have to be asking
Who'd be giving thug passion
The only girl that will have you
But baby you ain't even gotta trip
I promise on everything I love
They ain't even gonna get
Cause your the one I wanna make your heart skip
Give you chills all the way from your neck
Giving you all my love
That is given you some satisfaction
Who I'd be giving thug passion cause
I need you in my life
Show you things you've never seen before
Kiss you on your neck
Putting your body all in check
Boy you ain't seen nothing yet
Loving you to the day I die
Giving you good love that make you cry
Hit your switches side to side
Cause giving good love with a little bit of twist
On your body your gonna love to feel my lips
Making your body shake from head to toe
Make you say oh no no no no no
When I do romantic things like that
Especially when I slide my necklace
Up and down your back
Cause your talking to a true
You talking to a mack
So when your body get off guard
I'm gonna put it back on track
Cause you the man for me
The only girl that'll have you leaving
It's been five months
But it wasn't good enough for you
From the Heavens above
To wipe the tears from my eyes
But after all that I still loved you.
But now there's something I have to do.
And my eyes are all out of cries
Now you had me on my knees
To send you back to me
You even made me feel like I could not breathe
When I... all I wanted to do
And to give you all of my love
But you took my love for granted
But you can't have it
Wipe the tears from my eyes
God send me an Angel from the Heavens above
You can come on in and close the door
Chrome bars in the back
Got a kit on the bottom
Yo that shit is tight
Rolling up to the club
I got parking reserved
Got money in my pocket and it's all to the good
Paparazzi got me dizzy
Ain't a damn thing getting any easier
Stop letting people keep teasing you
Yeah you rolling it up
Got it in between your lips
Got me banging in your ride
And you're cranking it up
And you're bumping them up
Got my records in your shop
And you're picking them up
Can't catch me Friday nights
Yeah it's like that uh
Player haters see me and they just can't stand it
Way ahead of the game
Leaving you so stranded
Make you say goddammit
Waited for this record
And it finally landed
No one or nothing can hold me back
Won't forget where I'm from
So I know where I'm at
My game is all illegal
Plea the fifth no perjury
You can open up your eyes instead you blink
The keys to the Mercedes
Slang that on the fever
5 on Lily and Anthony
The love of my life went away
And I can't sleep at night
Why can't you see that I miss
Why can't you see that I miss
And ain't no body ever gonna do
The things I do for u
Tell me why when I call you at home
U say you're with your friends
Why can't you see the love
Why can't you see that I don't want
That I can't understand
I don't want it to be wasted
Look at your sexy body
Every night I go to sleep
I want you to be the one right beside me
Boy need you in my life

Loving you without no lies
There are times that I'm with you
All I want to do is touch you

Tell me tell me what it'll be like
Boy need you in my life
Ooh why is love so much pain
When all I was told was lies
To know someone I gave my heart to
A love that is endless
Memories no one can take away
The pain that I will feel each and every day
And it's gonna be hard but I will pull myself through
To know someone I gave my heart to
A love that is endless
No one to be by my side
Stuck with misery and pain
You were the one to blame
To know someone I gave my heart to
A love that is endless

You can come on in and close the door

I pray to god I don't forget who you are you mean everything to me...
Your were in my dreams before I even knew there was a you and me
Now I can't wait till I see your smile when I wake up each day
It makes it worth while what kinda love you have in side...
Especially the kinda heart as empty as mine
All the soft tenderness is the one thing I don't wanna miss...
I pray its time for me to say goodbye
Ill never forget looking in your eyes
I pray that I feel your touch and if god doesn't forget our love
I pray when I close my eyes I can still see visions of you in my mind
Everything that you've given me only comes in a fantasy
It seems like life go so fast and this time I wanna make it last
I hate that you live to die... but only god knows why
We all have a purpose and to see you again will all be worth it
I pray its time for me to say goodbye
Ill never forget looking in your eyes
I pray that I feel your touch and if god doesn't forget our love
I pray when I close my eyes I can still see visions of you in my mind
I wish that I could stop I wish time that
Of my life and ask god on my hands and knees
To never let me forget all my special
Memories see I'm only promised today and if it's my time to go
I don't want the love of my life to ever fade away so one
Last time let me open my eyes to see what my life use to be like oh god
I pray its time for me to say goodbye
Ill never forget looking in your eyes
I pray that I feel your touch and if god doesn't forget our love
I pray when I close my eyes I can still see visions of you in my mind
I need your love baby.
You been giving me so much lately.
Your love I'll never deny.
And I'll still need more.
Until that day is here.
Finally we can be ourselves we don't have to be alone.
Why would you walk when you can run with it
Baby take all my love
The whole world stops and I forget to breathe
Suddenly we can ourselves you don't ever have to leave
Ain't no mistake you can't go wrong
A love like this don't come along
I've got a hold on you
You've got me torn in two
Why would you walk when you can run with it
Baby take all my love
Baby close the door and grab a hold of me
I can feel you so deep inside of me
God send me an angel from the heaven's above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
Cause all I do is cry
God send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes
Left without a word and nothing to say
Wonder why now I want to up and leave
See it's all about you it's not about me
Break me down for a minute now
See I knew from the jump see I had some doubts
Should have known then you would never stay true
Should have known then that I could never change you
Now I'm on my knees and I'm begging god please
And I try to open up my eyes I sure do try to see
But this man got my heart in a box and I can't even find the key god please
God send me an angel from the heaven's above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
Cause all I do is cry
God send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes
No matter what I do it stays the same
Still I couldn't see I was stuck in the game
Told me to leave my key or the locks gonna change
You wanted a new day one without me
What happens when your ride or die chick is living every night with some good
Just want to kiss your eye lids
One more chance take a trip to Hawaii
She just looked at me and started sighing
I guess this is good bye
Still not realizing what it all means
Still got the dreams that included you and me
Got me on one knee willing to do anything to make it right
I'm trying to get doctor Phil's number for advice
Never thought so many times you'd make me cry
Deep down in my heart I used to believe that I was meant for you and you was
But without trust there is no love
And I'm sure gonna miss them kisses and hugs
Got to let go or I never will
Can't wait for the nights where I can't stay still
Say that you won't but I know that you will
Deep in my heart I know you'll never change
And everything you do I'll always be the blame
God send me an angel from the heaven's above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
Cause all I do is cry
God send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes
God send me an angel from the heaven's above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
Cause all I do is cry
God send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes
Oh god... send me an angel
Send me an angel from the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my heart from being in love
Come on in and take off your coat.
All your clothes are soaked.
Would you like me to put your shirt and your pants
Don't worry I got a top that you can have.
You in all my thoughts
I can't understand how you do the things you do.
You make me feel good inside.
You look into my eyes.
Just one kiss on my lips
And this love I know this is definitely it.
This is definitely it.
You make me feel like I need
It makes me feel like I need more.
I couldn't ever let no one come and take your place.
Unconditional love I finally see.
See a world with a whole new place.
I see his love and it's written all over his face.
You make me feel like I need
It makes me feel like I need more.
I couldn't ever let no one come and take your place.
Sometimes I sit and I think about
Without love and affection.
Direction to stay on my feet.
Without your love my life has no meaning.
You make me feel like I need
It makes me feel like I need more.
I couldn't ever let no one come and take your place.
You break my heart you think
That I don't love you If you look
Deep inside your heart you know
That I really do care so when you
Need me I promise I'll be right there
I dedicate this song to the
Love of my life lately I know
Going right but you know
I'm the one for you and you're
The one for me that's why I sing
This song to tell you that I love you
Lying in my bed tears
To God that our love don't
And these words that I need to say
Oh you're the one that
I adore and no matter
I love you forever and more
So you say that you never miss
A good friend till they're gone
Well if you love me like you say
You do then show me the way
Back to your heart and that's why
And it's time for you to leave
How could you do this to me
Whatever I had I gave you my last
How you gonna do me like that
Can you tell me what's going on
Now you want to turn and walk away
You tell me that you don't want to stay
Can you tell me what's going on
Leave a message and I'll call you back as soon as possible
Why couldn't you tell me the truth if you didn't want me to kick it with you
Can you tell me what's going on
From all the long fights in the middle of the night
To all the hard work to try to make it tight
You're the one I want for the rest of my life
I need you here babe. You're so sincere babe
Want to give you all of me
Push pull I love what you do
Its Friday night we was geared from head to toe
The moment I leave his side
She tries to creep up from behind
I seen her with my own eyes
Why you trying to lie
There's plenty other guys
Why you gotta fuck with mine
See hoes like you get fucked up
After the club its on and that's what's up
Go ahead and look yeah I know hes fine
Trying to run up but he's already mine
When he looks at you he laughs in your face
Silly hoes you should know
You can never take my place
And drop it like its hot
No matter what you do
Don't try to be sneaky and keep it on the low
You should already know
To him your just another hoe
She said what you mean
I came to the bar to get me a drink
Shit you was on my man
Faster than I can drink
What you think I'm a fool
You think he's gonna leave me
You an average chick stop grabbing him
I'll cock back my hand
It will be a one way trip
You should last and this is it
All my ladies out there
You know what I'm talking about
If you got a good man you better look out
Tell them hoes you better push on
They on a mission better listen to what I said
Stripper up in the club
The can look but they can't touch
Paid for college up stage
Even though your dropping loads
Don't be afraid throw up your shit
If your the type that like to ride out
If you go shopping every week
Keep the heat underneath your seat
Still got 2 cars and a fat crib
If you work two jobs a day
Get that money girl stay pay
Never let a man bring you down
You're a queen girl here's your crown
Yeah you got it going on
Tell me have you ever loved someone so much that it makes you want to cry
Tell me have you ever loved someone that no matter what they did you needed them by your side
Baby I know that I can't live without you in my life
But baby why can't I just do all the things that's right
O baby I know that I can't live without you in my life
But I can see it when I look at you
I can see it now that I don't deserve you
So many nights I sat and fooled with you
Not even realizing that I might lose you
Never admitting that I make mistakes.
Not having no more of them tears falling down your face
Why can't I just run and hide from all the blame that I've given you.
Tell me why because I don't deserve you
Baby I know that I can't live without you in my life
But baby why can't I just do all the things that's right
O baby I know that I can't live without you in my life
I don't deserve to feel your touch...
O I don't deserve to feel your love
O baby I know that I can't live without you in my life
But baby why can't I just do all the things that's right
O baby I know that I can't live without you in my life
That I don't deserve you
Tell me have you ever loved someone so much that makes you want to cry
That'll do all the things that you do.
Make my heart skip a beat.
By the way that you kiss me.
This is the way that love's suppose to be.
Candy kisses all over me.
Always want to come back for more.
Always seem to take my stress away.
We got the sweetest love in the whole
No I can't be without you.
Don't ever want to think about you loving
This is the way that love's suppose to be.
Candy kisses all over me.
Always want to come back for more.
Always seem to take my stress away.
We got the sweetest love in the whole wide
Candy kisses on my mind.
Candy kisses on my mind.
This is the way that love's suppose to be.
Candy kisses all over me.
Always want to come back for more.
Always seem to take my stress away.
I can see you never loved me like
I can see that I wasn't the one you wanted forever with
Please tell me that I'm wrong
Tell me this ain't what you felt all along
Baby are you happy all alone
Cause you will never find nobody like me
Now it's time to say bye bye
Took this heart and for the last time
Is it really worth it
That you will never find nobody like me
Cause you will never find nobody like me
Now it's time to say bye bye
Took this heart and for the last time
How could you do this to me
How could you do this to heart that was yours
How could you do this to me
I can still see visions of you walking out that door
You'll never find nobody like me
Cause you will never find nobody like me
Now it's time to say bye bye
Took this heart and for the last time
Lately I know me and you been going through some hard times
Swim the deepest sea just to keep you mine
And you don't really know what I feel when I feel your touch
It makes me wanna get on both my knees and tell you take all my love
Baby take all my love
Baby please don't leave
I know I said a lot of things
I couldn't stand to wake up each morning
And not see your face anymore
A feeling real deep down inside it makes me wanna cry
I ask myself why did I
Do those things that I didn't mean
It's not too late baby we still can see if it was meant to be
Baby please don't leave
I know I said a lot of things
I couldn't stand to wake up each morning
And not see your face anymore
Everybody makes mistakes
But baby please don't let this wait
I can spend my life without you
I wouldn't know what to do
When you go through this
I wanna feel you next to me
Baby please don't leave
I know I said a lot of things
I couldn't stand to wake up each morning
And not see your face anymore
Nobody knows what you're going through
But I know this much is true
I need you in my life
I need you by my side
I wanna see your face
And I know that if it's meant
I don't wanna let you go...
I don't think that I can take
I'm feeling the worst
Lord give me one more chance
I wish I could turn back the hands of time
I wish that I can take the pain
This pain and suffering out of your life
Now I'm here in memories
Of how things how used to be
Can't hold these tears from falling from my eyes
Can't hold this hurting inside
I don't think that I can take
I'm feeling the worst
Lord give me one more chance
It's not supposed to happen this way
You're supposed to live to see many days
I swear the angels can hear you from many miles
In my dreams he tells me but I already know
I just don't wanna let you go
But I don't wanna let...
I don't wanna let you go
I need everybody all around the world to listen
Many days I done cried myself to sleep
Many days I done asked God to take me
25 years old and I'm losing my mind
Sometimes I feel like I just wanna breakdown and cry
Sometimes I feel like I just wanna breakdown and cry
Quick to cock back ya hand and call her a bitch
Sometimes I feel like I just wanna breakdown and cry
I can make you feel real good
Tell me all the things you would like to see
All the things you never felt
Take off your shirt loosen your belt
Keep touching on your face
I'm on my way lets go for a ride
I can make you feel good
I can make you feel real good
I can make you feel real good
Let me lick your neck
All over your chest is where I wanna kiss
Turn off the lights and take off your clothes
Close the door and just relax I've got a plan and that's a fact
I'll fulfill all your fantasies
I'm that one in everyone's dreams
The dream where you wake up soaking wet
Where you find yourself with me in the bed
Pull my hair touch on my back
I can make you feel good
I can make you feel real good
I can make you feel real good
Let me lick your neck
All over your chest is where I wanna kiss
Turn off the lights and take off your clothes
He call me up on the telephone
When he feeling nasty
You already know you can have me
You wanna touch and grab me
Now he on the telephone sending me a text
Tell me how much he love me and miss my sex
He like it that I do it slow den I do it fast
I can make you feel good
I can make you feel real good
I can make you feel real good
Let me lick your neck
All over your chest is where I wanna kiss
It all started March 2002
About to take it wit some people imagine you
Tell me what I'm gonna say huh
Tell me what I'm gonna do
I seen you once or twice
I seen her in your eyes
I see it on her face she think she got you now
But I'm here to take her place
But there's one thing I need to say
These arms of mine they are yearning from wanting you
These arms of mine they are lonely from missing you
Best kept secret on the low
Didn't really see didn't really know
How much I wanna have it
It was just like a quarter of happy
You might think that you do but you don't know what the half is
Don't know if I'm wasting time
Can't tell if your running game
Can't tell if your throwing a line
Every time that you leave ill miss u
Wen the next time ill kiss u
Nobody would have ever thought that I would leave my guy to be wit u
But I know this time in tell you its true
Its time for me to pursue all my thoughts and dreams
These arms of mine they are yearning from wanting you
These arms of mine they are lonely from missing you
I give you everything to the last drop
You don't need to stop
You ain't messing wit no immature
But I already know you can handle her
I would have never thought twice in the back of my mind
That through all these year you would finally be mine
These arms of mine they are yearning from wanting you
And out of the 5 years all the shit that
You done put me through
And I can see now love will make you
No matter what you've done to me
I took you back anyway But now
I don't see myself getting back wit you
And every single way I think about those
Done went and found somebody new
You didn't appreciate the things that I've done for you
And god knows I tried to make it work but
Try to tell myself why should I feel so bad inside
When the only thing you've done to me
Was tell lies after lies
Now it's time for you to see all the things that you've done to me
You can nice so we can be naughty.
I'll make you feel good I can love you too
We got the sweetest love in the whole
No I can't be without you.
This is the way that loves suppose to be.
Always seem to take my stress away.
We got the sweetest love in the whole wide
Candy kisses on my mind.
Candy kisses on my mind.
This is the way that love's suppose to be.
Always want to come back for more.
Always seem to take my stress away.
You can nice so we can be naughty.
I'll make you feel good I can love you too
We got the sweetest love in the whole
No I can't be without you.
This is the way that loves suppose to be.
Always seem to take my stress away.
We got the sweetest love in the whole wide
Candy kisses on my mind.
Candy kisses on my mind.
This is the way that love's suppose to be.
Always want to come back for more.
Always seem to take my stress away.
I dedicate this song to the love of my life
But you know I'm the one for you and you're the one for me
That's why I sing this song to tell you that I love you
Praying to God that our love don't fade away
I dedicate this song to the love of my life
But you know I'm the one for you and you're the one for me
That's why I sing this song to tell you that I love you
So you say that you never miss a girlfriend till they're gone
You'll show me the way back to your heart and that's why
I dedicate this song to the love of my life
But you know I'm the one for you and you're the one for me
That's why I sing this song to tell you that I love you
I dedicate this song to the love of my life
But you know I'm the one for you and you're the one for me
That's why I sing this song to tell you that I love you
If you down we can split
I guarantee that you can feel it
Giving you all my warm embraces
And if I give them to you
I guarantee they won't be wasted
Touch on your face wit my fingertips
Kiss you all over your body with my soft lips
I whisper little things in your ear
Tell you all the little things
That you love and deserve to hear
I'm always looking in your pretty eyes
Telling you I love you
When I tell the other fellows lies
And that's the way it's always gonna be
And you don't even have to be asking
Who'd be giving thug passion
The only girl that will have you
Leaving you on your knees
For your keys to your Mercedes
Now I be the type of girl who walks in the club
I promise on everything I love
They ain't even gonna get
I wanna make your heart skip a beat
Give you chills all the way from your neck
Giving you all my love that you're laking
But here's some satisfaction
Who'd be giving thug passion
Show you things you've never seen before
Kiss you on your neck
Putting your body all in check
Boy you ain't seen nothing yet
I be the one that be by your side
Loving you to the day I die
Giving you good love that make you cry
Hit your switches side to side
On your body you're gonna love to feel my lips
Making your body shake from head to toe
When I do romantic things like that
Especially when I slide my necklace
Up and down your back
Your talking to a mack
So when your body get off guard
I'm gonna put it back on track
And I'm the A M A N D A P E R E Z
The only girl that'll have you
For the keys to your Mercedes
Let me see your body move
Don't just sit there get your groove on
Never miss a beep from a freak with a big behind
Take your hoe to the honeycomb hideout
Baby it's a 304 thing
Let me see your body move
Don't just sit there get your groove on
Used to make ends with the birds and the bud
Let me see your body move
Don't just sit there get your groove on
Will put you in a twist and they don't miss
Just a piece of the game
And some wanna get high but I gets fly
From the Coast with the most to the best thigh
And I can't forget Chicago and Frisco
And all the rap superstars and they crews
Cause baby it's a 304 thing
Let me see your body move
Don't just sit there get your groove on
When your jam's at the top of the charts
But you can't play me like a game of spades
I came with a few and released my flow
Long haired freaks with pretty eyes
Now give me that joint to hit
Every girl was a bitch and a bitch ain't shit
The world was a pussy and it's all for my dick
The freaks and the fleas and the G's was gone
I gotta get back on track
Cause some ladies wanna choose and abuse
And a lot of y'all probably can't handle this
Cause you don't think y'all act scandalous
And you never been checked like this
But bitch I been around the world
I been around the world...
I been around the world...
I'm no joke when I stroke for a client
G with the high top fade
You looked like you ain't been pumped in a while
And have your money in a big ass stack
Bend your ass on over and touch your toes
This dick of mine ain't friendly baby.
Probably because I'm 19 years old
I fuck hot pussy until it's cold
A big old butt and a smile and her rear up
So when a hoe want to fuck to the flow of a teenage pimp
I wanna see that rim so
Motherfuckers out there can't fade me
And bitches out there don't phase me
I clock the dough while I slang the blow
G's gonna do it to you slow
While you sing along hoe.
It's a 304 thing baby
It often means vagina miner get to the moaner
I didn't know a rap song could make your jock that long
Got to turn the other cheek
So now I got damn groupie on my snoopy
In your Gap and your tight clothes and your fake gold
For a ride in a Benz or a Beamer
Won't luck fuck for a trunk of stuff
Some of ladies wanna know why I say bitch
To get rich or to make a point about a trick
A bitch is a woman who sucks and fucks
A hoe is a girl that'll do the same
Or wrap it up tight in a jimmy hat
So this is for the college and the high school crew
Yeah... y'all stay tuned
Or somewhere with a blunt in your mouth
Till we both get up the mountain and just pop like guns
Pull apart when you get silly then just eat on ya belly
I graduated from ya cock and took the course again
Jawbone like no other and quick to get another
Hooker just like her to come stroke y'all bird
One day I bumped into her at the car wash
Demo tapes to my new CD
I'm still the God to your Vertical Joyride
When I smack that ass don't forget ya chips
The women fight even though they are dikes
But one of my balls was stuck up in the sugar walls
Y'all had to pull and push
Mixed with Belvedere and Red Bull
And tried to stick my other nut up in her butt so she can...
Gimme some baby or maybe
Call me when you're momma ain't home
I get a lot of play because I get a lot
I try to get ahead when I get behind
I wish I was a pair of panties full grown
So let me get a sip of this night train
So we can do the right thing
I tend to be a big butt freak
And you're all that with your feminine fat
Star struck little hooker with a rump
Hey you need to ride with me
She said as my head shook no
Had to go and get the hooker from the Wood
And that's how it goes you know
Bout to go to the suite and hit my favorite hobby
As I walked in the door to get the booty Hobbes
She fell down to her knees and gave me props
Got a number two fiend for the jeep to creep
I clock dough when I rock shows
In the Jeeps or the fly Mercedes
She gives me tonsil action
And just let it flow and open ya throat
You can never catch her on her back
Back with the hoe you know
It's the pimp of the century
The dog from around the way
But let me get straight to the facts
So they all eat a dick up well
So we can have a big Three's Company
Two big booties in front of me
The whip appeal is a joke
I scoop a freak like you're frozen
But you gotta be more than a trick tramp big booty hoe
And I'm glad you ain't got a man
And I'm glad you ain't quit the band
And I can't wait till you're through
Make it go round and round
Make it come all way down
Make it go round and round
You got the kinda look in your eyes
That makes me wanna marry you
But first let me carry you... to the California king
Intelligent lady with class
You make me wanna tattoo your name on my ass
And you look so good to me
Make it go round and round
Make it come all way down
Make it go round and round
I wanna get you wet like you wanna get
When I dip between your hips with a thousand licks
Make it go round and round
Make it come all way down
Make it go round and round
One time for you mind
Said he even had a Benz
Found out he was a dummy
And the pussy made him sway
And it wasn't no different hoe each and every day
Now he's on the way to player's court
I got a homey who calls me a captain
Cause the hoe that he with I already boned
Now he got two babies by her and he still
With a coach bag full of cash
You can call me cheap
Yo momma told me that you was a hoe
Yo momma answered the phone
And opened up her big mouth
Come to think about it every time we ah did it
You know what she said baby
You wanted to love me down
Make them bitches say they blew it
Take my baby out to Ruth's Chris
You said I wouldn't be shit
You said I wouldn't be this
There's some shit I probably shouldn't say
Trap money that I put away
Don't you hit me for the discount
I been out here moving mountains
Hit these bitches with the curve
All these bitches say they love me
Tell them it'll never work
Broke boy get money now
Grey days turn sunny now
Baby let's just be honest Let's just be honest I used to pull up in that ghost sometime And go ghost sometime If you love somebody that you love sometime
If we making up take it off right now
Stop checking on the phone when the boy lie down
Drunk enough to write a song about you
Only writer say those words about you
Only writer keep it true for you
You look so desperate right now
Only writer say those words about you
Drunk enough to write a song about you
Only writer say those words about you
I ain't got no time Quiet for all that I'm on a ride
I ain't got no time Quiet for all that I'm on a ride
Crib got a view with the tower and the sunset
I ain't got no time for the talk of who up next
I don't never hear the phone ring
Need Ms for the whole team
Coming with the fake shit you get the real me
I don't never hear the phone ring
Need Ms for the whole team
I can't trust a girl that's heard it all before
Lost a good girl for a bad one
I can't trust a girl that's heard it all before
Lost a good girl for a bad one
You too fine to blend in with the rest of these hoes
I'm just another guy that tried impressing you though
Bite my tongue until it bleeds
Ain't really adding up to much
That's too much to ask
I just went and copped the half
Passing through for the band
I don't care what you care about
Good girls turn to dancers
Bad bitches need a savior
Leave no liquor for the chaser
Spilling liquor on the sinks
I been filling up the safe
Ain't no tint up on the Wraith
Let these bitches see my face
Golden child in the projects
Kicking women out the studio
Hoes be fucking up the process
This ain't the time and the place
Flooded the time and face
Telling them lies out the face
I don't care what you care about
Good girls turn to dancers
Bad bitches need a savior
Leave no liquor for the chaser
There's some things that I ain't said yeah
There's sometimes I wished you stayed yeah
Miss you every single day I
Think about you when I drink alone
Pop a pill and call you on the phone
That's that over thinking when I'm home
Losing focus when I'm all alone
You don't love yourself
You don't trust yourself
You don't love yourself
You don't trust yourself
You don't love yourself
You don't trust yourself
I know fights and I know pain
Got a cup full of that purple rain
Only way that I can turn the page
Hope these lyrics find you on the way
If she gone I can tell y'all
You don't love yourself
You don't trust yourself
You don't love yourself
You don't trust yourself
You don't love yourself
You don't trust yourself
I flooded the Rollie just to mess with you
As long as my brothers is straight
Free all the partners upstate
Just wait till all of my partners is done with probate
I kinda sorta had enough with ya
Might go back on what it was wit you
We just need some keys just to put them inside it
And it'll be straight
You adjusted to the road
You talk a lot just to say that you have it
Tied up with the talk and the drama
Sometimes I gotta shit on you
Routines bringing all the bitch out you
You ain't never seen it all
I be leaning with you later
You're the one that I wanted
You're the one I get high for
You're the one that I lean on
You're the one that I lean on
You're the one that I wanted
You're the one I get high for
You're the one that I lean on
Fuck the who's who and the what's what now
I don't even know what you're tripping about
There's no too often these days
We're going running and running around
Just want the respect
I'll go for me and my set
You heard it all before
You heard it all before
You know that it's you when I sing about you
Can tell that you care when you crying
Can tell that you gave up on trying
I'll go for me and my set
You heard it all before
You heard it all before
You be in the birds throwing up the bees
Sitting pretty in the drought
Black on black lenses in broad day
You be in the birds throwing up the bees
Smoking something right for the wrongs now
Make these bitches sing along now
Don't let them lyrics leave you wanting now
I'm still fucking all them broads now
I lost patience in a waitress
She been living too complacent
All them rumors make me anxious
Cause every time I'm around you
You be acting different you ain't acting like yourself
Here's a bullet for your pride babe
Cause every time I'm around you
You just got some bad news for me babe
Here's a bullet for your pride babe
To you I'm just a struggle rapper
I hear the chatter and the sudden laughter
Now I got it like I said I would
Used to never say you proud of me
It's awkward that you doubted me
I just copped the whip and a house for me
Cause every time I'm around you
You be acting different you ain't acting like yourself
Here's a bullet for your pride babe
Cause every time I'm around you
You just got some bad news for me babe
Here's a bullet for your pride babe
I can't trust a girl that's heard it all before
Lost a good girl for a bad one
I can't trust a girl that's heard it all before
Lost a good girl for a bad one
You too fine to blend in with the rest of these hoes
I'm just another guy that tried impressing you though
Bite my tongue until it bleeds
I tell you what you wanna know now
I tell you what you wanna know...
I lose my voice telling you to stay now
I tell you what you wanna know now
I tell you what you wanna know...
Even if she won't life me on my way down
Won't let your guard down
Now I took you seriously
Tell you what you wanna know
I hope you finally find yourself when I'm done though
I lose my voice telling you to stay now
I tell you what you wanna know now
I tell you what you wanna know...
I lose my voice telling you to stay now
I tell you what you wanna know now
I tell you what you wanna know...
And I'm way down town yo
And I feel like it's about to me
Won't find love in the hills
Won't find love in the valley
Had a one night thing
Found love parked up in an alley
Don't listen to anything they say though
Tell me all them stories that you made up
Pretty women singing trash songs
Put these bitches in my sad songs
Won't find love in the hills
Won't find love in the valley
Had a one night thing
Found love parked up in an alley
Caught you slipping in the mix for like two days
Caught you slipping in the mix for like two days
Bout to hit you with the fashion
If you ain't know then it's you're bad
Bad bitches only can taste it
She don't wanna waste no time
She just wanna waste my time
Won't find love in the hills
Won't find love in the valley
Had a one night thing
Found love parked up in an alley
Wonder why you ain't called yet
Wonder why you ain't called yet
Wonder why you ain't called yet
Wonder why you ain't called yet
I used to wake up in cold sweats
I been territorial but now you free
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
I'll clean it up in the morning
I'll clean it up in the morning
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
I'll clean it up in the morning
I'll clean it up in the morning
None of you bitches acknowledge me
I'm breaking up like it's bad service
Paranoia make the past surface
I used to wake up in cold sweats
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
I'll clean it up in the morning
I'll clean it up in the morning
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
Let it be bad tonight
I'll clean it up in the morning
I'll clean it up in the morning
Ain't no make up out here gonna make you
Sometimes I think you want this
Just don't ignore the signs
I'm just an audio clip with some truth
When we don't speak it speaks volumes
My pockets looking blessed up
All that talking never stretched up
They talking like they jealous of me
They talking like they never loved me
They talking like they next up
Champagne showers on the way
Ain't no fingers left to count my blessings now
I'm naming all the hearts I've been breaking
I'm naming all the hearts I've been breaking
Champagne showers on the way
Now you look so defeated
If I knew what I know now
Tell you I ruined you
You hide tears with a smile
Don't let your pride hear me wrong
Don't let my drive steer you wrong
You hide tears with a smile
Don't let your pride hear me wrong
Don't let my drive steer you wrong
I'm still on the table
I'm still on the table
Must've heard everybody that I care for say I don't care for you
You hide tears with a smile
Don't let your pride hear me wrong
Don't let my drive steer you wrong
You hide tears with a smile
Don't let your pride hear me wrong
You said I'm different
All I need my baby and a cigarette
All I need my baby and a cigarette
Watch you get done up and tell me it's for me
All I need my baby and a cigarette
All I need my baby and a cigarette
All I need my baby and a cigarette
All I need my baby and a cigarette
Broken heart to broken promises
Broken hearts to broken promises
Baby you a beautiful stress
I don't got a cigarette yes
I just got a match and a fuse
I could really use a distraction
I could really use a real one
Real you when you show up
Real me and you grow up
I take the blame for the drama
I take the blame for the jealousy
I take the blame for your enemies
I take the blame it ain't the same love
I take the blame for the jealousy
I take the blame for your enemies
I don't even know what to say
Pull up to the crib with some Roses
My good intentions go to waste
Pour my heart out to the floors now
Kept on shooting just to prove that you ain't know now
Hope it stings just a little when it cuts through
Kept it distant from the women that be telling lies
I don't get enough credit
I make it work either way till the peace stop
Let them bodies hit the floor now
Let them bodies hit the floor now
Pour my heart out to the floors now
Kept on shooting just to prove that you ain't know now
In the bottom of this bottle I go drunk now
I'm still open I'm just hoping you ain't shut down
I can see your soul and I'm looking in your eye
Let the bodies hit the floor now
Let the bodies hit the floor now
Pour my heart out to the floors now
Treat your feeling like a target bring your guns out
Kept on shooting just to prove that you don't know now
Let the bodies hit the floor now
To go higher first gotta dig the depths of the Earth.
We dug the roots of evilness like a hex or a curse.
Plant the seeds in the fertile soil of resistance.
Do know what you love
Simultaneous death and the birth.
Ultrasound to wearing a crown to the burial ground
From the bottom up we horizontal.
More than organized form the rivers ocean ponds flow
Crisis type of opportunity timeless like clock's broke
In a flash they could crash like a stock market
Went from chicken shit ho to magnificent pro
Then she slid me some bread like
So if you need something don't be ashamed
All I need is good love
Dick in this bitch's stomach
Spending this bitch's money
Dick in this bitch's stomach
Spending this bitch's money
I copped some white in the 5th and pulled up right on a bitch like
So if you need something don't be ashamed
All I need is good love
Dick in this bitch's stomach
Spending this bitch's money
Dick in this bitch's stomach
Spending this bitch's money
I was riding down 6th and got stop by the pigs
I'm like pop up this dick
I looked up at the light like what the fuck is my life
They said my plates ain't legit so they opened my shit
She had stolen the whip and this bitch had warrants and shit
And this bitch pulled multiple licks and this bitch had bodies on burners
And when I called her from my cell the only message I heard was
But no you wanted to spend the money
You got new sneakers and all that
So now you deal with them bricks
All I need is good love
There's no need to wear these shades when I drive
I need to see the leap before the stride
There's so much more that can happen
I'm sure that you can imagine
Them two legs will get you right for action with good brain
That get you all the answers
Tell me where you wanna go
But I don't really think that it could get much better
Put your feet in the water
The city belongs to you girl
So when you're living the dream is it hard to see
Does your heart beat heavenly
I think it's much more than the green leaf but it helps of course
There's only one season
Can you believe the way that they talk about my paradise
Don't tell me where you're from girl
Tell me where you wanna get to
Put your feet in the water
The city belongs to you girl
Don't tell me where you're from girl
Tell me where you wanna get to
Put your feet in the water
The city belongs to you girl
And we ain't even smoke but you swear I got that dope
Said even if we don't puff
Won't make a difference
My body's leaning to the right baby
You tell me go on and spend the night baby
I know enough to get you high baby
I got about a half an ounce of that tree
Got about a half a cup of that lean
I said go on and kick your feet up
And we ain't even smoke but you swear I got that dope
Before my high comes down
Though I don't even know ya
I got about a half an ounce of that tree
Got about a half a cup of that lean
I said go on and kick your feet up
And we ain't even smoke but you swear I got that dope
And we ain't even smoke but you swear I got that dope
With a bad imagination
I want a love sensation
I make the body wait for it
You could be the right one
With a little dedication
Gotta make me follow through
Gotta make me chase it
Oh I want a stone groove
I want a love sensation
Just wants what it needs
Car keys in the cake dish
Gotta take the pipe work
Gotta make me taste it
I'll take you all places
I want the world stage
You got that good conversation
You're such a cold piece
I wonder if you're taken
Just wants what it needs
I just wanna know who put you on it
Knowledge is the motherfucking key
Remember when you only knew how to ride on it
Now you be tossing it like Serena
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nothing
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nothing
I be steady drinking with you baby
Long strokes to the promise
Remember you couldn't take it at all
Tell me when the hell you got so long winded
Talking and walking just like a diva
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nothing
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nothing
Who put you on to that
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nothing
Who put you on to that
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nothing
I'm naked down to my socks
All this shaman I got
Ride around on my block
Okay back to my thesis
Okay bases are loaded
Then she make it to Parker
She MVP with the trophy
But it's made with a fender
I had no time to play pitches
Since the type of my sentence
Motherfucker I'm ready
I can't stand what you got
I can't help but to watch
Collard greens in my pocket
All these clouds I think I finally see the top
And motherfucker I'm ready
Motherfucker I'm ready
If you got a problem we can light it up
If you got a problem we can light it up
If you got a problem we can light it up
If you got a problem we can light it up
I don't miss her one bit
Some days I think about it
But I get over it real quick
It's too late to make amends
We can never be friends
I don't miss her one bit
She didn't care about the reach
But if you leave then I might roll.
We walk to your home...
Soft lights a bitch sounds
From your first dream that be a sinner
Back and forth of course it's never no one
I just want to run it on the canvas
Brushes stroke is stroking but she go nuts
Speak of me as something you can ride on
Guess how many pages put you open up the gate and get it
Soft lights a bitch sounds
From your first dream that be a sinner
Excuse for me not to to keep you creaming
Take it till you say it
I am going to open up your place and paint it
Soft lights a bitch sounds
From your first your first dream be a sinner
Looking like you woke up got a dreaming
Fishing where you living but there's no luck
Who can paint the picture like dale
I just want to run it on your canvas
Stroking but she pushes stroking but she go nuts
Speak of me on something you can ride on
Guess how many stages put you open up the gates and get it
She don't give a fuck
She don't ever stress me
All we do is sex and leave
She don't even like me
Said my lust for life and these lights are bright and I love these women
Said we bopping slow and we do the dance like we more than winning
Said she off the beat but she's fine as fuck so I find the rhythm
I don't know this bitch but I love this shit and we both are splendid
And she loud as fuck so I grab and touch and she don't get offended
Grinding and biting and kissing me
She don't give a fuck
She don't ever stress me
All we do is sex and leave
She don't even like me
She don't give a fuck
She don't ever stress me
All we do is sex and leave
She don't even like me
We must've been together
I bet you knew just who I was
Somewhere around your second lifetime
We danced on Persian rugs
We fucked and fell in love
And that is who we are
Energy carried on and on
Energy carried on and on
With the Scope on I can kill them all
We can be lovers two souls in a different life
But you know we done here been here before
How did you know we only sip clear liquor
Type of shit that get that shit
Flown across the pond
I think I love you ooh
We must have been together
It's something like I thought it was
And with the last impression
You left me with an open door
Energy carried on and on
Energy carried on and on
In the night I can't quite put my finger on
We believe that we are star crossed
Forgive me if I am wrong
Energy carried on and on
I'm so tired of good health
I'm so tired of this roof and my bed
I'm so tired of cooked food and good moods
I'm so tired of making love
I'm so tired of being kissed
I'm so tired of making money
I'm so tired of one night stands
So tired of living lavish
Two birds and one nest and being notorious
Even when you're gone I can still feel you
I want it more than air
The only thing you ever really loved
Even when you're gone I can still feel you
I want it more than air
The only thing you ever really loved
I'm so tired of this scene
So tired but can't close my eyes to find sleep
To have it all but not at all complete
Wanting you is all that ever drives my being
It's all that ever drives my being
Even when you're gone I can still feel you
I want it more than air
The only thing you ever really loved
Even when you're gone I can still feel you
I want it more than air
The only thing you ever really loved
Baby this right here's a world of fun
But you can get this hit whenever you want
And it's on right now
And it's on right now
Suddenly suddenly suddenly
Sending it sending it sending it
Cooling it cooling it cooling it
I'm lifting you off the ground
Suddenly suddenly suddenly
Sending it sending it sending it
Cooling it cooling it cooling it
I can move it to wherever you are
We can live this life forever more
Baby this right here is a one on one
But you can get this dick whenever you want
And it's on right now
Suddenly suddenly suddenly
Sending it sending it sending it
Cooling it cooling it cooling it
I'm lifting you off the ground
Suddenly suddenly suddenly
Sending it sending it sending it
Cooling it cooling it cooling it
Suddenly suddenly suddenly
Sweep the fear from your heart
If you need it then go there
Sweep the fear from your heart
If you need it then go there
A bird with the word came to me
The sweetness of a honeycomb tree
And now my luck was taking over me
Couldn't fake it if I wanted to
I had to wake up just to make it through
I got my patience and I'm making do
I learned my lessons from the ancient roots
I choose to follow what the greatest do
A bird with the word came to me
The sweetness of a honeycomb tree
And now my luck was taking over me
Couldn't fake it if I wanted to
I had to wake up just to make it through
I got my patience and I'm making do
I learned my lessons from the ancient roots
I choose to follow what the greatest do
We see the same things
We sing the same songs
We feel the same grief
You grew up in the home beside me
I always had a friend to call
I pray I leave before you're gone
A bird with a word came to me
The sweetness of a honeycomb tree
Couldn't fake it if I wanted to
I got my patience and I'm making do
I learned my lessons from the ancient roots
I choose to follow what the greatest do
A bird with the word came to me
The sweetness of a honeycomb tree
And now my luck was taking over me
Couldn't fake it if I wanted to
I had to wake up just to make it through
I got my patience and I'm making do
I learned my lessons from the ancient roots
I choose to follow what the greatest do
Working my fingers to the bone
But keep your eyes on me
Your heart don't stand a chance
It feels like it's been far too long
Your knees can't hold your legs
Your feet just want to pace
The eyes keep me all in a trance
Would you leave it all in the back of your head
Ain't nobody holding you back
Your heart don't stand a chance
Your knees just want to break
Your eyes keep me all in a trance
I know the approach is so far from what you're used to
And I'm not closing my tab
Your heart don't stand a chance
Spinning the greatest hits of Hall and Oates
Open of chronic smoke
I know my time will flee
But your heart don't stand a chance
It feels like it's been far too long
The moment is all that we have
My meter should be up by the half
A ticket is the least of my cares
Mind on a tip of a cloud
Your heart don't stand a chance
I'm waiting for the white flag
You're talking with the blunt in your hand
The sunlight cover your wounds
But I'm hoping that I look the same as the way you always knew
But I'm not over what we had
Your heart don't stand a chance
I remember being tumbled around and not being able to get to the surface where the air was
Working hand to hand and no avail
So I got leaned like codeine and pills
It's been a while but wow you still care
And I can do anything but move backwards
The hardest thing is to keep from being distracted
My big sister still claim me on them taxes
Tell Uncle Sam I just need a second to add this
Gave my momma ten racks
And she packed and went to Chumash with it
Could triple the worth and give me half of it
Half of it I took in the back of the air mattress
I'm glad that you finally made it to the future but you're late
If you want you could wait outside the building
Stepped in the waters
I bring you greetings from the first church of Goon Baptists
United Fellowship of Free Nationals
And the first lady is a bad bitch
With slanted eyelids and sick hashish
Sweating on my Patent Leathers
Pressure turned their feather weight into a Cinderella
I ain't seen the ground in days since I grew propellers
Word to the liquor that killed my grandpa liver
Only a handful will go the distance
I swear I seen this shit coming as if I was living up under the plumbing
I was cooking gumbo whipping the voodoo
I was in the jungle running with Zulu's
We was looking past the struggle while life was moving so fast
To the top of the food group
Doing what I want and how I should too
Stepped in the waters
But it didn't touch my soul
Stepped in the waters
But it didn't touch my soul
Would you boys mind explaining the cause
Of what made this great park go underneath this hood
My faith is buried somewhere underneath the town
If I didn't love you then I damn sure love you now
Say ain't shit change but the bank statements
Spent the summer in the rave with the beach babies
Went from playing community ball to balling with the majors
But I'm short on my patience
I spent years being called out my name
Living under my greatness
But what don't kill me is motivation
My faith is buried somewhere underneath the town
If I didn't love you then I damn sure love you now
That is if you're still living
And get on down before the judge give the sentence
A few more rounds before the feds come and get you
Is you gonna smile when your date gets issued
You know them feds taking pictures
If cash ain't king it's damn sure the incentive
So they don't force you into some hole
Generations of harsh living and addiction
I came to visit during the seven year stint
But they wouldn't let me in because my license suspended
Now I'm scraping the pennies just to kiss you on your cheek
It's gonna be a couple weeks before I get it
And one of these is my rise
One of these is my downfall
And I'm the one to make it right
I wanna make it right
And one of these is my rise
One of these is my downfall
And I'm the one to make it right
I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right
Both my hands are tied
Afraid of thinking I dug my own grave
Fuck around with this
I don't mind this pain
They'll never know just how long it takes
And put it all on the line
It must be what you put me through
It must be what you put me through
A little while longer
There's a point in which I'll lose my self restraint
I fancy throwing it all away
I see it to my own demise
It must be what you put me through
It must be what you put me through
It must be what you put me through
It must be what you put me through
You can open your palm
Waiting to catch a break
The cards will fall where they may
They wanna know where I'll be in five
Get up and move your feet
You know I love what you do
You know I know you love what I do
And I should take this heart and pawn it at the auction
I had dreams that I would blow like a Nintendo Cartridge
I'm from the city where they wear bikinis in the water drought
You know I love what you do
You know I know you love what I do
And even though I heard around the town from all the gossip
I was the one you counted one before you stacked your wallets
And you contemplate how to get me back like Liam
You know I love what you do
You know I know you love what I do
You told me your whole life story in a few shorts
Alone with my own thoughts
The combination of all my life's complaints and a few strong dreams
I don't remember the parking lot
I just remember it's all the same
And it's all the same
Bring the corners from left to right
Coming closer to midnight
Couldn't wait to get you naked on the first date
So it takes one to make one
The compromise we made
I don't recall the parking lot
I just remember it's all the same
And it's all the same
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be like that
You don't need me in that light
It's all right with me
Just send it off and I'll give it right back
Right down to the last face
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be light weight
You know I really can't fuss about it
You know I really can't funk without it
You know I really can't funk without it
You know I really can't fuss about it
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be like that
You don't need me in that light
It's all right with me
Just send it off and I'll give it right back
Right down to the last face
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be light weight
You know I really can't fuss about it
You know I really can't funk without it
You know I really can't funk without it
You know I really can't fuss about it
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be like that
You don't need me in that light
It's all right with me
Just send it off and I'll give it right back
Right down to the last face
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be light weight
This stuff is getting harder to get
Baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
It's easy and wholesome when no one's in the way
Well if no one's in the running for the part
I'd love to pick a day
Cause baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Well if no one's putting numbers on the board
Cause baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Maybe it's too much smoke in the room
And she don't want that Mary Jane in her Vidal Sassoon
Baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
I can't wait for the moment you can take off
I pray you don't have to cut my time short
I would rather not say much
The gods have approved
The universe is in tune with me and you
That's why we here involved
Your body moves and fluid motion
I don't know if I'm the one you want to stay with
But I know that I'm the only one who makes you cum
And as soon as I break down the wall
I'm riding the wave of your waterfall
As soon as I break down the wall
I'm riding the wave of your waterfall
As soon as I break down the wall
I'm riding the wave of your waterfall
Don't use it all at once
Don't use it. Timing is all we got
She dumb as a brick but she pass all her classes
She told me a story as long as the last
Oh what a hopeless romantic
Fucking with jokers and addict
She told me everybody close to her age is full of mad shit
Short attention span and little patience
Don't be fucking up your scholarship
I can't help you with grants
As God is my witness if you don't jump back in this bed
Don't use it all at once
I only want to do what feels right
I have to be gone before the midterms
Don't use it all at once
Don't I make it look good
You gonna have to back it up
I might never come down
You know I might never come down
You might not never come down
You might not never come down
You may never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Can't see her with this pitch black Gucci pants on
Let me take these bitches off
That's a whole lot of reefer
You gonna have to back it up
I might never come down
You know I might never come down
You might not never come down
You might not never come down
You may never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
You may never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
You gotta be shitting me
All that body that you came with
But where are you mentally
I know he hit all the time
But you ain't gonna hit for me
I just wanna focus on and love this
They say the heart is underneath
Underneath and guarded in securities
I finally found the key
Underneath the garments that's the double D's
I don't mind them little bitty berries
I don't need nothing to distract me
From this connectivity
You know I see it all the time
The same old shit to me
I just wanna know what's under
They say the heart is underneath
Underneath the guard of insecurities
I finally found the key
Underneath the garments that's the double D's
Before you go and pop that bottom baby
Before you go and get butt naked baby
I know you gotta little bit of baggage baby
Two jugs I'm gonna start grasping you baby
Separation between truth and the fake
You can get a new rack for five k
You can get a rapper by Friday
For me I can't live in the Northern Hemisphere
Time never cares if you're there or not there
All you ever needed was a simple plan
So let's celebrate while we still can
I saw my son today in the likeness of a full grown man
So I'll celebrate while I still can
I remember when I couldn't even see the point
Of stepping out the motherfucking house
How many others have walked the same ground you have
You'll be wise to pay attention to your old head
I spent the whole day throwing records in the deep end
So let's celebrate while we still can
So let's celebrate while we still can
I remember when I couldn't see the point
But now I'm at the point where I got it figured out now
Do not be concerned about the money in your brother's hand
I was under the impression that we all want the best of life
So let's celebrate while we still can
And the body of the fellow that is doing the maneuvers
I enjoy some of the old and I enjoy the new
I'm on my fifth brew and my rents due
One for the occasion and get ya good suit
Fuck your reservation
Since a little baby skating in boogie boards
This one's for all the little dreamers
And the ones who never gave a fuck
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Mama always kept the cable on
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Fuck your reservation
This one's for all the little dreamers
And the ones who never gave a fuck
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Mama always kept the cable on

This one's for all the little dreamers
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch

This is the music that you gotta feel
Gave you the truth before I got a deal
Used to be scared of all my fears
Till I woke up from this nightmare
Now until we leave this earth
The music make your speakers burst
I always put my people first
It's deep how when I speak they say
I'm preaching like I lead a church
No proper opposition. Competition gonna need a nurse
My job as an artist is making miracles
To show you how to struggle poetic and make it lyrical
Crystallize the thought to make it clear to you
And make the revolution irresistible
This one's for all the little dreamers
And the ones who never gave a fuck
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Mama always kept the cable on
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Oh my gosh guys calm down
And I doubt if very few people are able to find these types of conditions again
Due to crowds and controls and much bureaucracy
Yeah you a g g g g g g g

Blaming mother fuckers like you for the demise of hip hop
And that's the way it goes
Fall back while I flow
Put your drinks in the air
Know that your city taken over and your bitch thinks I'm Casanova
While I'm blowing up the club I'm at
Don't aggravate cause you never elevate
Took the world in my hand
Feel like throwing up the triangle
Me and the crew doing what we got to do
Never held down again
Fuck regrets and mastered the past
So we celebrate everyday as if it's our last
My boy b said we gone take it to the top
I told him we will never stop
That's the promise held
With the mindset of a king
Now my phone going ring ring ring
Singing all the way to the bank

You've never seen a real MC kick it like me
So I'm telling you g's how to mother fucking see

Pilots be dropping out the skies with diamonds in their eyes
Spies be trying new highs to claim the new prize
That's why I sympathize with there lies
Real and fake split between too realities
Claiming they got patron but it's just water in the glass
Making my mark in my city ain't easy
Seems to me your lyrics don't appease me
Head down to red rooster get yourself a quick fix
Shoes are a rappers reputation
Bring me those force ones
You know I only be rocking them in perfect condition
My kicks will leave you smashed out a like military forces
Don't start to grin or ill put you head first in a bin and notify your first of kin
These kicks give me true flow no blow
I'll make it snow swag you be acting all mad
Hard with these kicks
Golden G when I creep
You know I only be rocking them in perfect condition
Chicks spill that bub
I'm the mother fucking man
Ideas turn to objects
You know I only be rocking them in perfect condition
Fucking with the flow of motherfucking century
Y'all fucking with the flow of motherfucking century
Spilling these black bottles
Pulling up in that new Beamer
My flow keeps on going and flowing
All day and all night boy

They really want to know what we be doing
Man I got my business on my mother fucking mind man
Playing with this shit like I got a cigar
Got grind up like yeah we this far
They really want to know what we be doing
They really want to know what we be doing
I guess that I'm truly driven this is just my decision

You know I'm drunk as hell and I'm high as fuck
Got Bangs in the studio
We at the parties in the hilltops
They all wanna leave with me
Smell cologne and grab your phone
Let's get you home and get it on
I'll make you see it's meant to be
Hand in my arm where you post to be
Best friend on the phone honey make it three
No know time is money when it's time for me to shine
Next time I come I know who's with me
And let me get to doing my time
I suppose let me take you there
Want it all to stop and just to groove
Yeah girl you got me in the mood
I just don't know how to choose
I know you were abused
That smile got me amused
So let's keep it going and fuse
Do you really have the heart to commit
I'm not really trying to catch you
And I'm really not trying to fall
Money isn't an issue as far as I'm concerned
I'm just riding with you
This life's all I got so I gotta live hard
Give it all I got so I gotta live it up
This life's all I got so I gotta live hard
Give it all I got so I gotta live it up
That's all right I give it all I got until the death of me
Give it all I got and live it up until it's over
I'm only getting better you can watch me take over
You can only make me stronger you can hear it in my lines
You can only make me stronger you can hear it in my lines
This life's all I got so I gotta live hard
Give it all I got so I gotta live it up
This life's all I got so I gotta live hard
I don't think they are
It's crazy every time I'm up in the scene
I'm pulling up in that brand new limousine
But you've got to come equipped
The life where everyone judging you
You can be the sidekick to the mac
Born to go and get it straight back
For these meet and greets
We ain't got to worry about them at all
Let's get it going so they knowing
Everywhere the cash be blowing
There's champagne bottles flowing
And a few bad ass models that be elbowing
I think you know who you are
I think you already know what this songs about
But in case you don't
Now you gone know this
I guess you want to know why I don't talk to you no more
Why it's only one word answers
Going natural born sinner
3 weeks got you feeling like a lifetime
But it's not the right time
I told you its flight time
Now you gone know this
I feel lost on the inside
If there was one girl in this mother fucking club now
Yeah you asked to come with me
It all started when you at my concert
Yeah I was that dude that made your night work
Yeah you know you wanted to flirt
That relationship got you fucked up
These nights out got you thinking
That boredom got your mind ringing
Now you gone know this
If there was one girl in this mother fucking club now
Up in the club right now
Doing what we doing right now
Doing what we doing right now
Doing what we doing right now
Doing what we doing right now
Y'all know what we do
Doing what we doing right now
I'm on top of my flow like motherfucker I'm gifted
That friend zone it never damn existed
I'm still the type of dude to get lifted
That top contender like I'm really with it
I should have taken my chance
Now I'm about to pass it back like pass it pass
Yeah I guess I'm that ass
But fuck you for making shit public
Now your dealing with the wrath like its tragic
Even your cousin said you weren't good for me
I heard getting fucked in the backseat was uncomfortable
Yeah it's ever so likely
While you still owing and your car needs towing
And I've been grinding on the daily
But you're still acting so shady
I couldn't stand being round you knowing that you cheated
Plenty of fish in the sea is what they say though
Getting morphed into knowledge like like play dough
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
When you find a real woman she will treat you right
Everything is all worth it when there is a fight
And I've been grinding on the daily
But you're still acting so shady
You always hit me on the late night
You think I'm down for that midnight
But I ain't naive anymore
Throwing your shit right out the door
You pulled the trigger but I'm holding the gun
And I've been grinding on the daily
But you're still acting so shady
Let's get this shit like we do it
Coming through these streets like it's one more time
Got these bad bitches like it one more time
Man you don't really do what I do so here we go
These rappers be talking like they in the studio
That's really rude of y'all
I flow way harder than your other other man
Just another another jam
So I'm asking how long until we ball
How long until I roll
Let the haters hate all day
Fuck you when your feelings like I don't care
Ya momma would be proud see you with a star
At the same time that they judging
Raising all the flags like a referee
Not everyone was born for this limelight
How long do I gotta do it right
Have you ever felt so
Confident within your own abilities
That you gonna make a crazy ass song
That you gonna make some crazy ass changes in your lifetime
Well if you ever have
Is all they screaming when they see us
When we coming through these streets
When they listen to you one time
Is all they screaming when they see us
When we coming through these streets
When they listen to you one time
You ain't really in the same league
You not really on the same team either
We pull it out like its tandem
Got these other rappers acting random
So keep it chill while we chill
Is all they screaming when they see us
When we coming through these streets
When they listen to you one time
Is all they screaming when they see us
When we coming through these streets
When they listen to you one time
Those that don't still run in fear
Is all they screaming when they see us
When we coming through these streets
When they listen to you one time
Is all they screaming when they see us
When we coming through these streets
When they listen to you one time
Fucking with the flow of motherfucking century
Y'all fucking with the flow of motherfucking century
Spilling these black bottles
Pulling up in that new Beamer
My flow keeps on going and flowing
All day and all night boy
They really want to know what we be doing
They really want to know what we be doing
Man I got my business on my mother fucking mind man
Playing with this shit like I got a cigar
Got grind up like yeah we this far
They really want to know what we be doing
They really want to know what we be doing
I guess that I'm truly driven this is just my decision
Your bitches is like a 7 my bitch is like a 10
Remember back then with them backpack snap back
Everything in this world has to be destroyed
Yo I'm looking to fresh
So we looking real blessed
Yo I'm looking to fresh
So we looking real blessed
Nightclub yeah y'all know what we balling
Yo I'm looking to fresh
So we looking real blessed
Yo I'm looking to fresh
So we looking real blessed
If you thinking possibly I'm here to tell you no

You ain't ride till the wheels fall off

Sitting on the throne like it supposed to be
I ain't got no time for these fake dudes
You ain't ride till the wheels fall off
You ain't ride till the wheels fall off
You ain't ride till the wheels fall off
Hair under my ass cheeks feeling the fucking pain
But I can balance the barrel enough to make you
Now this ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh
They run up on the side of your ride and then blast
When it pops off it happens that fast
If you soft you just won't last
I was born in Los Angeles city
Sun shines but sometimes it's dark and moody
Whatever you do to me you won't stop my grind
Someone takes away from your stacks
Nowadays it's a struggle to hustle
So I came with the rain to boost it back
Real life is a struggle but we used to that
No matter who you are or who you be with
Now this ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh
They run up on the side of your ride and then blast
When it pops off it happens that fast
If you soft you just won't last
And you wonder why they found another body in the streets
No AC packed in a car eight deep
But the taste of revenge is oh so sweet
Your boy won't sleep till I'm up in that Benz
Same old blocks is the spots where I hang
On the stoop with the vets but your boy ain't changed
Now this ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh
They run up on the side of your ride and then blast
When it pops off it happens that fast
If you soft you just won't last
Even the strong get chin checked tested and blasted
More single mothers than brothers than we got on the street
Fame is lame but life is lost in an instant
Hit the fence then sprint through the neighbor's yard
Now this ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh
They run up on the side of your ride and then blast
When it pops off it happens that fast
Then we never care about what you say to us
We grow the crystal freely from dirt up to the ceiling
We flip it in the valley out here in southern Cali
Analog or digital it's spiritual and physical
In literal or literally industry down here in Cali
Analog or digital it's spiritual and physical
Analog or digital it's spiritual and physical
In literal or literally industry down here in Cali
Analog or digital it's spiritual and physical
In literal or literally industry down here in Cali
In the club or on the corner don't play with us
In the Limo shut the window and break it up
If you try to take it from me it's dangerous
Analog or digital it's spiritual and physical
In literal or literally industry down here in Cali
Analog or digital it's spiritual and physical
In literal or literally industry down here in Cali
You ain't got no game
Coming through like a train
Looking to take over the world is my goal
It's like inch by inch and step by step
I'm closing in on your position and destruction is my mission
It's like switch when I bust
Now you're whole crew is dust
The real scream team on your scream scene
It's like showdown on the range
Go tell me who wanna tangle with the
Insane like a runaway train I'm in your lane
Like it's only 3 seconds to score to win the game
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
And you are type strange
And I got my eye on you
Get up out my way is what you better do
My tactics is unsportsmanlike conduct
With hang time like a coat hanger
Lightning strikes and the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Every step I take shakes the ground
Cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
23 ways to make a pay
I'm 28 light years old
Here's an example of how I can stress your full court press
I'm gonna mingle in your face and take the lid off
Just use your head and forfeit the game
Throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot
We'll leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
With nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip
Through the blinding road
And you expect to see a weakness
You're fucking leaches
Pretend to a friend of me
But you stab me in the back
When all I did was pick you up
And spit venomous words
Used weapons you heard
Would damage my whole world
But you must have mistaken me
Because I do to your ass
What you do to yourself
And now you can't win one
You taking it all in son
You can cry now but you will not smile later
They got a fund for the gun
And a ghost in the machine
They police the crack fiend
But protect the dealer
Rob you with the lawyer
Fuck you with the handgun
Throw you in the lineup
Then arrest the wrong one
It's just the way they do it
Unless you got some money
Cause money makes amends
And sometimes peoples get murdered for friends
It all depends on how much you spend
It's the land of the free
And the home of the gun
Where they kill for the dollar
And they worship the son
Dear god I really hope I ain't the only one
All up in your nugget... Ha... You can't fuck with it...
Straight from the Psycho Ward
They all wanna raid my spot and take hits
Actions allowing the words to barrage in
Can't keep my head straight from the laws I break
For those who really don't understand
Only to survive all these street cop killers
It ain't no thing but mad
The only reason why I say this
Till all the screws in your head are loose and worn
Think I need to rehabilitate
Psycho assassins smashing your membrane
To take the Emperor's temperature
Pass the blunt from East to West
Where I'm from the Man of Steel is made of Teflon
Even if my eyes shut and jaw swollen
You always smile when I frown
I keep it real no more beef with Cypress Hill
No matter what I do the billy it's gone flourish
Or it's styles that flow like Hudson River debris
Next MC that claim to keep it real
Criss cut clean numerical order bills
The best thing since grits and fake tits
I'm so fly when I walk I levitate
My caliber's first rate
Exceptional above great
Hip hop has plenty of Steel
Nobody move stay still while the Masters build the Track
Immortal thought for the recorder
Consider the picture deliver the scripture still hit ya
If the shoe fits ya wear it
You'll inherit the culture
Let me break down the whole structure
Just real no outrageous fantasies
Conceived in the Bronx
Born and raised but on the real
Feel me if ya got the skill
Faster ghost like Casper
Like Steel hard to penetrate
Generate dollar signs you follow mine
Come in peace money I will bless that
Bring the noise leave you on the Fourth
Where I rest at For real
That's the sound of EMS
Pick a single any single
What I bring you makes you tingle
It's the lingo from the star like Ringo
Over the dub sound buzz
It's all the same son get it correct
Then I'll collect a check and you can expect
Something you'll never forget
Lyrical flex cash checks
I step through the brush like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
We rock in places where alcohol's for all ages
In the dark night the torch that enlightens
With the energy needed to turn a seed to weed
Yo we serve a full spectrum of flavors that's robust
Hustle in the same industry I don't trust
I know California dig it like a gold rush
Make way for the prophets of rage
While they engage to let you know we're in a new age
Cause that's a dangerous man that can speak with his hands
I'm on the next train to your thought that's caught
And now you rocking with the camp that rocked last at Tramps
From the body to the mind like I'm Jesse Ventura
Want a party all night to the breaking dance
So give me dancing dancing all night all night
Hey DJ just play that song
Want a party all night to the breaking dance
Just still to move and money
En el party like daddy
Hey DJ just play that song
Want a party all night to the breaking dance
People getting confused
Me and Tony come with the hash shit
Mary more than fast why furious
Of war drums and suicide missions
And electric chairs marking you with the stamp
Situations escalate in the date of 2000
Invasion dreams reoccurring
But it's the same one everyday
Televisions trackers citizens massacres
The new order with no border renegades
The rule over the new age Malaise
This dream never goes away
I wish I knew the meaning of all this
Premonitions of war cloud my every thought
But I refuse to believe we all go down in flames
I wake up in the middle of combat
From the attack of the bomb killing on impact
Disintegration over the whole nation
When all the world is safe within their dreams
An empty feeling creeps within my soul
Looking for some company
Hit me with the truth motherfuckers don't sell me
Your enemies see a weakness and you look ripe
You slip one time you a victim of crime
In hopes of a brighter day for children of the night
And if I ever have to heat it up you might get warm
It's no wonder how we cross roads and get divided
The streets got you clutched in the cradle of doom
You get out of pocket they make you invisible dude
We never know what peace is
We all about war for the money and the violence increases
I never thought about it when I was younger
I never thought about we all just numbers
I only thought about the food on the table
I was taught to make moves when you're ready and able
Sometimes you feel alone and you just simply go for self
And you don't care about anybody else
For money and power then they seem to lose control
When I hit the corner all you see is the light from the Chevy
That's why I'm quick to put these chickens on blast
They twisted fingers say you know who we are...
He started firing and then he just charged...
I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Believe and you can see
I crack the mac back and pop off rolling
I haven't seen my mama in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me
Fuck that I ain't give a fuck about the law
You would think that they wore bra's
Believe in all the things that you never saw
So feel the need to bleed
All you hear my enemies going
They twisted fingers say you know who we are...
He started firing and then he just charged...
If Snoop a keep a foot on the streets
And lead and cover the sheets
You never seen a thug like this
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace in fact
I could be beast of the East motherfucker.
I never hesitate to blaze
It's ashame but somebody gotta die
They say it happens state to state
They twisted fingers say you know who we are...
He started firing and then he just charged...
BBC you know them was gun shots
BBC them was gun shots
We finally got a piece of the pie
And get your back up off the wall
You see the boy at the bar
When I'm done baby doll
Of course I do my two step
I drop ashes in my cup
I got my arm around this smut game
I got the drank and the smoke
It's going down understand me
I like my birds nasty
I burst in them cats cage
And you know what I came for
Let me on the dance floor
I party like it's my birthday
I came to shake a load off
So take your clothes off
I'm buying drinks and they love it
Gucci bag and Gucci buckets
He don't know how to act
In the club with a sack
The speakers is off the meter
You can't help but to clap
You made enough for the night
The throw them gang signs
I don't remember where I'm parked
Looks like were stuck in town
Get get get get get down
Get get get get get down
Get get get get get down
Get get get get get down
I Got No Choice Let Me Just Do This For Love.
Like it like it like that
We will rock the floor

Warning warning warning warning

Blue and gray and light
Right here by my side

When you fall in a deep sleep
Let me be the one that you seek
Make you dream pleasant things
Thoughts of love as angels sing
Make you see a clear blue day
Watch the sun shine our way
Make you feel no signs of fear
But only treasure the pleasure
Now we'll never be apart
I wanna be your guiding light
Be the one you feel is right
When you give your all
Fly you to a place rarely seen
Breathe the air smell of spring
Through miles of white sand
Take a look out at he sea
Enjoy the view of harmony
Roll in tall green grass
And make the moment last forever
As we kiss and we play
That kind of love your dreaming of
Shine bright as flowers

Welcome to Fear Factor
But I've noticed that
It's not professional

I think I wanna tell y'all a little story
Always playing games but never had a toy.
Middle finger to the sky like I don't give a god damn.
You need to go to college and you need to do this
And I was like no sir I'm straight on it I ain't trying to spend
40 thousand to be 50 thousand in debt when I graduate.
But I ain't in the streets so I gotta slang beats
Then I sold my first beat got a couple stacks
Got a couple diamonds got a couple hats and
Filled up my closet with some shoes and some slacks
Now I am back to square one where I'm at now
Being a honest man I'm just trying to make it out.
And I don't have a job
I don't know why I say these things
But it's the reason why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
I don't know why I say these things
But it's the reason why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
I don't know why I say these things
But it's the reason why I sing my song
I don't even know why I'm in this goddamn booth
But it's the reason why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
I don't know why I say these things
But it's the reason why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
I don't know why I say these things
But it's the reason why I sing my song
If you ain't noticed I don't really give a damn
So I decided to do music just to make some fans
I just think of crazy shit and try to make it jam
Just to show y'all how y'all can benefit if I'm generous
It's 4 o'clock and I don't even think I'm finished yet
But it's the reason why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
I don't know why I say these things
But it's the reason why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
I don't know why I say these things

Went to her school where the kids that she did meet
Did not treat her friendly
His pockets are empty
He just ran away and then he moved to the city
And had a daughter named Lizzy
There's a girl so depressed
From the drugs and the stress
All the diamonds on her dress still can not relieve stress
That she faces from the world
All she want is happiness
But all she know is big success
Maybe in your dreams you can fly away
Maybe in your dreams you can fly away
It's right around the block.

But don't it sound so
I'm playing out the left
Was raised up in Decatur
So I'm straight up out the deck
And so they say that I'm obsessed
I grew up in the struggle so
But being in the struggle is what
This ain't your imagination
I don't mean what I say
But what I say is what I stress
And I ain't really catholic but
I ain't a Christian rapper or a civil activist
But everybody feel me because I say the realist shit
I see why haters get all mad I don't brag
So here is what I got to offer
Words of wisdom so that you can get your mind altered
But don't it sound so
I'm lovely like the left field
I know I ain't around shorty but I rep still
Because of the record deal
And stress on my chest
Cause the world ain't right
I'm a keep it 100 to the day that I rest
But don't it sound so
I think I wanna tell y'all a little story
Always playing games but never had a toy.
Middle finger to the sky like I don't give a god damn.

Dirty hair full of lint from the carpet.

On that east side Howdy do

Hops out this car and he fixes his shirt

Well I done sacrificed a lot
And if a tragic happens then I pass my life to stop
Cause a brand new life's beginning
But I ain't intending for it to be tremendous like this
Face to the floor getting so frustrated
Real sharp on my thing like a razor
Blade come clean like a shape up
So guess I got a game of tape up
But can't speak up whenever you face em
Yeah I'm raw you know my flow
Hell yeah I'm all for the cause
Don't get it wrong this track is my own
Watch how you talk when you talk to the man
And told the police I don't know bout shit
Homey hold it right there
Home boy hold it down
Well it started out in the club Jut
When I woke up I took that girl back home
I was too young to know
But I've noticed that
It's not professional
But I've noticed that
It's not professional
But I've noticed that
It's not professional
I'll see you next time
I'll be gone for a while
I'll see you next time
I'll see you next time
I'll be gone for a while
I'll see you next time
I say I can't do no better because this is all I know
Where we get high and ride in sky scrapers
Get money now and ride or die later
Get shot and robbed by your own neighbor
But this cities where I'm glad to be
Give it to you so slow
I say I can't do no better because this is all I know
This is the home of slang and shit talk
They just get on all fours and get big balls
And my clothes turn into target practice
Cause the gas station clerk never saw what happened
Now they in the penitentiary a juvenile
This is for Decatur and this is how I sound
I say I can't do no better because this is all I know
This shit is all I know. Yeah. Born in South Carolina... raised up in Decatur.
I just I just wanna grip your body
I just I just wanna grip your body
I just I just wanna grip your body
And how far I bend ya
I just I just wanna grip your body
I just I just wanna grip your body
I just I just wanna grip your body
I just I just wanna grip your body
Make arrangements girl
I just I just wanna grip your body
I just I just wanna grip your body
I just I just wanna grip your body
Baby we can make plans
Here's a more accurate description
I just I just wanna grip your body
I just I just wanna grip your body
Well I'm trapped on a roller coaster
And they won't let me go so it's totally bogus
Till my mood get low like below the sofa
Somewhere far away where it can't go wrong
There's way too many snakes on this globe
But nobody wants to kill it
To get where I am I can give you directions
I need to leave someone give me suggestions
Built just like a subatomic nuclear weapon
But nobody wants to kill it
But nobody wants to kill it
Hello I'm just a mellow fellow
And I'm a keep it ghetto
I'm just a mellow fellow
I'm real calm cool and collective
So when I walk in they know what to expect it's
Stand in and mister all this hate so it effect it
Now that's what I call interesting
They can't do nothing but respect it
Hello I'm just a mellow fellow
And I'm a keep it ghetto
I'm just a mellow fellow
All about the green ain't worried bout yellow
The cycle is a merry go round so you curse when they cut off your umbilical
I remember when life used to be miserable
Hello I'm just a mellow fellow
And I'm a keep it ghetto
His name pop up when you hit play or on your Google search
Bitches bow they head and bend they knees just like they do in church
Drop doe into her purse before you get into her skirt
Till my pine box drop down into the dirt
Anyone with a pair of eyes can look and see
No legacy will ever be next to me or near by
They probably say I change the music in the dirty south
They say I sound like Dre when I'm rapping my verses now
So just accept me or don't pay me no mind
Either way you're gonna be hearing me all of the time
Whether on Greg Street or 107.9
Just like Brian Nichols I ain't spitting nothing but slugs
Because I'm literally amused by your sentiment
That the likes of the second verse can even
Skull and crossbones and death bandannas
A liquor store on every corner in Atlanta
I could really use some answers
About two years ago everybody was a trapper
Cause slavery ain't change
It's a modern day disaster
Now these are my words from me to you
Everything you do from your shades to your shoes
From your chains to your Coupe
Trust me I would know
I was raised on it too
Cause God won't let me
I used to wear a grill
Because it was the trend
Not because I liked it
I just wanted to fit in
And I tried to get dreads but my hair was too big
I ain't know who I was
What else was there to do besides look like a thug
So in my senior year at Columbia High
I dropped out of high school and I got signed
But you can call me Bobby Ray from this day forth
And I could give a damn about the fame and fortune
Honestly I don't even listen to rap
And if you make good music that's okay
It's easy to see we created a beast
Cause everybody wants to hear what they don't need
And now all the rappers got to struggle to give you
That bullshit music so they can continue
The position that I'm in
Is quite an interesting predicament I admit
Rap about aliens and sing about stars
Till you understand that's what we are
So we ain't got to struggle no more so we don't starve
I swear to God I love you with every bar
We all got problems that need to be solved
This is what happens every time I drive by
When I'm in that double bubble
They give me double bubble
When I'm in that double bubble
They give me double bubble
They weak and scrubbed up
This is what happens every time I drive by
When I'm in that double bubble
They give me double bubble
When I'm in that double bubble
They give me double bubble
That the one in the mirror ain't me
Its kinda me but it's not
Its just a mask that I got
So that I can rap and get off my block
Money and weed is in my shoe box now
Then I find out it was all in my mind
That's why I'm here to end all the fear
I was a man with no name
Now I'm attributing mo fame
But all of this ain't gonna matter when I a die
And say good bye so long
Everyone here gonna die one day
Shit to open up your ears and speak this real
The gold teeth don't really match with the suit
Nowadays folk would rather rap than go to school
But y'all don't really seen that there
After all everybody wanna kick back
I was a man with no name
Now I'm attributing mo fame
But all of this ain't gonna matter when I a die
And say good bye so long
They say that I'm changing
Fuck I don't need nobody but my god damn self
I don't need nobody but my god damn self
They say that I'm changing
Fuck I don't need nobody but my god damn self
I don't need nobody but my god damn self
Since I been in dis game
What comes around goes around
Your friends start enemies
Then enemies fall in your face
But it worked out both ways
That's why I stay paranoid
So I keep my middle finger up until I made it out
They say that I'm changing
Fuck I don't need nobody but my god damn self
I don't need nobody but my god damn self
They say that I'm changing
Fuck I don't need nobody but my god damn self
I don't need nobody but my god damn self
Hate to see me signing autographs
And I'll ask for you to ride my dick
Ain't no hip hop parade
They say that I'm changing
Fuck I don't need nobody but my god damn self
I don't need nobody but my god damn self
They say that I'm changing
Fuck I don't need nobody but my god damn self
I don't need nobody but my god damn self
But I don't need nobody but my god damn self
They say that I'm changing
Went to her school where the kids that she did meet

And that's the truth just face it
So don't get mad and angry
You know you really anxious
You light a cigarette up
Cause you are very anxious
Cause the way I treat females cause...
And I just wanna work you girl all night
Still you know I'm so good
Results from no love hoe
From Head to Toe She like Uh
You already know what world this is
Summer if your feelings are getting hurt my dear
Send me a text when your birthday is here
Just take that as a little donation
And I will see you at the next location
Just don't be everywhere I be I'm a relocate
And now I sing sing sing sing sitting on top of the world
Man I remember before I say that wait let me issue this statement
No way should reflection be mistaking for glorification
Still laughing and tripping still having the bitches
I'm rapping now reminiscing and god damn it we did it
From trapping standing and pitching with rich we stand in the kitchen
Splitting it eight ways flip it in 8 days
I ain't lying the pleasure was all mine
Have big work to move but we served the small time
Who would have thought we would be arguably the greatest of all time
Around here we developed such a sound down here
But duplicate it off the steel it can only be found here
Only listen to G's that other shit I don't hear
Shit they so far in the rear how would I even care
But talk about it for years and now we finally here
And now I sing sing sing sing sitting on top of the world
They say what goes up must come down but I ain't reached my cruising altitude
Take a look at what I did but can you imagine what I'm about to do
The places I'm bout to go and the money I'm bout to see
Gave bill gates some binoculars and said look out for me
Exceeded expectations even at def jam
My momma quit her job and now she works with six figures
Private planes help me travel in peace
To four cities in one day and four countries in one week
Put one of my partners right through culinary art school
Now he my personal chef so that bread he get it
Put them all in houses cleaned up all of my friends credit
And now they witness all the glitz and the glamor
Catch us eating at straits Atlanta with women with table manners
Order in Singapore and lobster
And now I sing sing sing sing sitting on top of the world
I know them haters don't stop plotting and wish you would fall
I see you down there to y'all this ain't like I got it all
Say I'm doing too much shit I say I ain't did enough
Remember saying damn if I could just get to a million plus
And now I'm like shit what the fuck is a million bucks
Triple that on my bond thanks to bigs and run
But never mind what I've been through just look at what I become
All the shit I've avoided what I done for my sons
And daughters and momma just call her
I sold dope and dropped out of school seems it's all they can see
They don't notice none of my family did that since me
I broke that cycle now my family live a life of
Mandatory minimals but not when the judge sentence them
Cousins in college where you think they get tuition from
Just for standing around wishing huh
And while you standing around looking dumb
I make it happen taking action over time got damn good at it
I say I can't do no better because this is all I know
Where we get high and ride in sky scrapers
Get money now and ride or die later
Get shot and robbed by your own neighbor
But this cities where I'm glad to be
Give it to you so slow
I say I can't do no better because this is all I know
This is the home of slang and shit talk
They just get on all fours and get big balls
And my clothes turn into target practice
Cause the gas station clerk never saw what happened
Now they in the penitentiary a juvenile
This is for Decatur and this is how I sound
I say I can't do no better because this is all I know
This shit is all I know. Yeah. Born in South Carolina... raised up in Decatur.
We know who they wanna hear
It's easier to sing than put my soul on a track
Cause the media has made a competition out of rap
I try to grow freely but they hold me to my past
Every single song is the same old track
And everybody wonder why the kids so bad
I'm like Superman in Metropolis
As I fly high over the populace
The only thing that I see is the irony
Think about the past and the life I lived
All of the days and the nights I spent
In the bottomless pit called poverty
You need more than your vitamins
The rap game ain't a lottery
Cause you still gotta deal with the politics
It just don't make a lot of sense
So I just stay positive
Then it's a prison of the mind you in
I stayed up on my game and my business I'm paid now
Tyler bent on his ass now
I'm the head of my class now
I prefer to keep hands down
I'm super psychedelic
Cause drugs have inspired every musical visionary
And this ain't even the album
So the thought alone should be scary
I do this for the geeks who feel they need to compare me
And everything gets blown and everybody gets buried
And reach out to the kids who the doctor prescribed with Ritalin
So this for all of my aliens and all the Indigo Children
And anyone who said I would never see this position
Allow me to drop my pants and turn around for you to kiss it
But that was the motivation I needed for me to get it
I mean... presentation...
A long time coming but I know
So I reach out to the listeners
Our fear of a free mind is hearing your spirit can die anytime you need to cry so you hide it deep inside
Easy don't focus your brain on what they mentioned
So when I take a break I go ape come back and play fool
We've been pompous ever since Columbus couldn't work a compass
We've accomplished what we conjured up while conscious
And consciously we conquered all the eye can see
Constantly concocting more options but jobs are still obsolete
It seems so odd to me and odyssey how honesty is honestly the rarest thing upon us its astonishing
Leaving us a laundry list of problems to acknowledge
While plotting with my phonics me and sonic and Bob
Non chomp and vises as I sit down and sketch my rhymes
Stretch my mind to figure out what's next in line
But I know change gonna come
Completely ignoring the fact that this is way more than rap
Some people wish you well man some people turn against you
But that ain't even my focus man that hate ain't on my menu
I'm in a different city about to rock a different venue
The hardest thing for me is to keep my composure
And even the people that swear they love so bad
Will go and put your dirty laundry on the cover of mags
And then everyone sees it and gets a good laugh
They only think about the rumors and the mistakes you made
Everybody's a fan if you boo me or applaud
Put my next to anyone in this industry
You still will never find someone that's in my league
Reality television fiends addicted like crack and smack
And then my business is put on the map
The more you start to pay attention to my sentences
The more you'll realize why I am lyricist
And why I sacrifice my time for this experience
And why my album still isn't in your speakers yet
Down side ... came off ...
Mad ... got ... to the money
Turn a war on ... then I ...
. Down for the zombie
Blue curly chain like it came from ...
What you say don't pay so sincerely I say
When Muhammad Ali came out of Cassius Clay man
He don't wanna see the crystal
Tell him to play at the at at at
Grind Time rap game bang bang bang man
His name pop up when you hit play or on your Google search
Bitches bow they head and bend they knees just like they do in church
Drop doe into her purse before you get into her skirt
Till my pine box drop down into the dirt
Anyone with a pair of eyes can look and see
No legacy will ever be next to me or near by
They probably say I change the music in the dirty south
They say I sound like Dre when I'm rapping my verses now
So just accept me or don't pay me no mind
Either way you're gonna be hearing me all of the time
Whether on Greg Street or 107.9
Just like Brian Nichols I ain't spitting nothing but slugs
Because I'm literally amused by your sentiment
That the likes of the second verse can even
Well she strike like a lightning bolt
She'll shock you up out your clothes
One strike then there she go
I make her strip like Puff did Cassie
Stood up in it and the girl got hype
And right after I plug her
But I don't know if I trust her
Like all up in my head tweaked out
Raising the hairs on my arm when she with me
What her and he did vertically
If I see her with him I pass out
And Led Zeppelin sell it
Sugar in the brain cells on my neurons
Someone gave her a medallion
Which means how she looks is arousing
Built like brick houses
The songs that you are about to hear
The sound that I have been crafting for years
And now I will share them with you for free
That's the only reason I do it
So can we get a systems go
Headed straight to the
So can we get a systems go
Headed straight for the
Well as I'm headed to the sky way up above me
I feel my body spinning feeling free and lovely
On this midnight vibe
And you can feel it if you tune into your radio
Look at the sky look at the moon look at the way it glow
I ain't no ghost so don't be afraid to go
On this midnight vibe
So can we get a systems go
Headed straight to the
So can we get a systems go
Headed straight for the
Like an astronaut floating off into the beyond
I do not need an engine I can ascend into the dark
So can we get a systems go
Headed straight to the
So can we get a systems go
Headed straight for the
But can you afford the cost to pay
Well welcome to the wonder
The land of make believe
That make you believe your safe
Because this is the place to be
You feel all right as long as the famine and war stays overseas
And anyone over the border
You look at like the opposing team
What if I expose my beliefs
That I hold real close to me
But can you afford the cost to pay
When I say the masses
Millions of kids in classes
One of them got kept backwards
For failure to do what they asked em
They will say he was stubborn and acted
Like he wasn't the son of a pastor
So he got him a pen and pad then
Just to make the days go by faster
And one day he decided he had it
And he left and he never look back at
All the relative mathematics
So he took the lies and detracted them
And divided them like a fraction
And he opened his eyes and realized
That he tapped into the galactic
But can you afford the cost to pay
But can you afford the cost to pay
But can you afford the cost to pay
Sing something good to me
And this world's so crazy
Sing something good to me
And this world's so crazy
Much more different then before
From the ceiling to the floor
Started with no books and pages
Just stick it out in the hood I was raised in
Cause see the hood ain't no location
The hood is simply where you place me
See now when I look at faces
I give a damn and a good vibration
Cause there is no reason you should be faithless
Cause look how far a hook can take you
From up here earth looks amazing
That's ram invaded and human races
And there is no reason to debate it
I am the universe and your crazy
Now let's take a new vacation
I was thinking Jupiter Pluto maybe
So just say goodbye and kiss your dreams goodnight
So just say goodbye and kiss your dreams goodnight
So just say goodnight to your dreams
Because tonight is the night of the beast
That's why I decided to B. O. to the B
One time for all the minds hypnotized by TV
Because everything is just a spiral to me
So get your hands up high
Because we will survive
And just kiss it goodnight when the day arrives
Okay this is very simple...
I come in you take your clothes off and I take pictures
She gets up and takes a shower
Now she is in the mirror for hours
By the way she is a model of course
Hair all made up and makeup powered up
10 years later now she's a hoe and
Everybody wonder why does she act so cold
Cause that attitude ain't natural
Because I'm really not into that there for
Watch her take off her bra
Ah she's a movie star
With that runway walk
She from my town far away
Then she moves to the A
To go to Georgia State
Then she got turned out
Now she is a actress to balls
To sang but ain't that pretty
She just trying to mimic the life in the city
But that ain't how she used to be and 2 or 3
Now they wonder if you will see
Everybody loves you girl. Everyone loves you.
Watch her take off her bra
Ah she's a movie star
With that runway walk
Just to make her some daycare money
And to pay for the rent bill monthly
But but 15 years down the line
She ain't the same as she's past her prime
Say goodbye to all the fame
I'm sorry to inform you that we will no longer
Be needing your modeling services darling
That's the way the cookie crumbles
Watch her take off her bra
Ah she's a movie star
With that runway walk
Watch her take off her bra
Ah she's a movie star
With that runway walk
It all comes crashing down
It all comes back around
And every single cloud
And it all comes crashing down
And in the midst of everything I drown
As the sky above comes crashing down
As the sky above comes crashing down
The doc said I need to take these every day
I don't wanna pray I don't wanna meditate
I broke up with my girlfriend yesterday
If I wanted to I could do anything
I could rap a verse but I'd rather sing
Everything goes around like a boomerang
It all comes crashing down
It all comes back around
And every single cloud
And it all comes crashing down
And in the midst of everything I drown
As the sky above comes crashing down
As the sky above comes crashing down
I'm already way way way up there
I'm already gone as I'm way up there
I'm all alone as I'm way up there
I think I need to have somebody come and tell me I'm not as crazy
Somewhere along the way
I done went way too far in space
I done went way too far in space
I'm already way way way up there
I'm already gone as I'm way up there
I'm all alone as I'm way up there
Somewhere along the way
I done went way too far in space
I done went way too far in space
I'm already way way way up there
I'm already gone as I'm way up there
I'm all alone as I'm way up there
Somewhere along the way
I done went way too far in space
I done went way too far in space
I'm already way way way up there
I'm already gone as I'm way up there
I'm all alone as I'm way up there
Tinted windows on the car ain't stock
And you already know how I do when I do it when I hop up out the car they stop
Creative rec on my feet
I talk it how I want to talk it
Y'all better know what the business was
Soon as I hit the club everybody grabbing on me cause
They wish they was I wish I could
Go back when back when I didn't get to much
To show y'all haters how I came up
When y'all ain't pull enough
So I get fresh to deffer than you you
Can't be me don't think you could
Yeah East side that's right on deck
Handle that good man you can have that back
Well I ain't nothing like y'all
Stay fresh from winter to fall
And you already know how I move when I move when I come through the door they pause
With them academic jeans
I walk it how I want to walk it
And to this day I don't play
I want them marble counter tops forget them paper plates
Cause you not me and I'm not like you
A whole bunch of real players in my crew
That you can only trust a few
That more music is coming soon
So make sure y'all stay tuned
Well it was just a dream
Looking down at the sky
I was shooting for stars
They say what goes up
But don't let me fall
They say what goes up
But don't let me fall
That if the clouds were to drop me
Then I'd fall out the sky
I don't really know why I'm here
I guess I'm just here for the ride
So call me whatever you want
Tie me to whatever you like
But let's get one thing straight
Product of my East Decatur home
Trying to keep my toes unfroze
Now I'm in your house
Now I'm in your stove
Everything I seen was a dream just a moment ago
Well it was just a dream
Looking down at the sky
I was shooting for stars
They say what goes up
But don't let me fall
They say what goes up
But don't let me fall
They say what goes up
But don't let me fall
That they can make for this
Then you can relate to this
I just blazed with this
Maybe roll one up then take a hit
Toast to the good life then take a sip
It's easy to see I was made for this
To picture my life boy
You need a higher resolution
I used to cut class in day
Then runaway at night
But now I'm ruler of the upper class
Well it was just a dream
Looking down at the sky
I was shooting for stars
They say what goes up
But don't let me fall
They say what goes up
But don't let me fall
Beautiful girls all over the world
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
It's so much nonsense it's on my conscience
I'm thinking maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant
Beautiful girls all over the world
I've been around and I've never seen another one
No other girl's on my brain and you the one to blame
If you asked me what's on my mind you probably won't believe it
So I play my role and never ever speak it
And all the while you just just to figure me out
But you can't see past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
Well ask me a question I tell you no lies
And I'm ahead of my time but I cannot rewind
The only thing I fear is the mirror in my bathroom
People look and try to see a disguise
But there is nothing that nobody can't see in light
If it's a song with a rhyme or a verse with a line
Then you understand in my mind
But you can't see past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
You know I got two belts the black and the white one
I see in my eye glasses
I can hear him through the wall like walk
I'm a slave to myself and disobey my boss
It's all in disarray this parade I walk
They get amazed when they catch a chain I toss
Amidst disarray are different ways I talk
And it hangs from your brain if my chain you caught
Like I cough without covering my mouth
I tip the scales like the King of the south
Forgot that I was fat I lost my way
But now I'm back looking for the shade I sought
Bobby Ray you know you got my numbers
And them there can't see us like hunters
But you can't see past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
You can't see past my shades
You can't see past my shades
But you can't see past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you're staring at that phone in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel
If you had one chance
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night
Somebody take me back to the days
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Then maybe yo maybe I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
So can I get a wish to end the politics
So here I stand and then again I say
I could really use a wish right now
Put me anywhere on the map with a backpack strapped
Plus they know when I come to the court this is my sport
Bet I'm on a brand new plane
Bet I'm in a whole different zone
I ain't really from this place
So I'm up all night long
Really I'm in outer space
Really I ain't got no home
Impossible to copy like what everybody try to do
We cool as some dudes on them waves out in Malibu
And I'm still representing
Tell me where am I supposed to go
If only you knew what I knew.
Then you could see just what I see.
There's nothing worse than feeling like a ghost.
There's nothing worse than feeling like a ghost.
Tell me where am I supposed to go.
And who am I supposed to believe.
If only you knew what I knew.
There's nothing worse than feeling like a ghost.
There's nothing worse than feeling like a ghost.
The streets don't give a damn
They're filled with such pollution
The kids don't stand a chance
We're trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hand
We're filled with so much hatred
I abandoned my own planet
Some of it was strange but most of it disturbed me
Always in detention for the lack of my attention
You can call it deficit
Really I just didn't listen
And I was always missing
I still elevated to the level that I'm at
The streets don't give a damn
They're filled with such pollution
The kids don't stand a chance
We're trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hand
We're filled with so much hatred
Sometimes it's hard to grow
While living in fear of the unknown
How can he ever give love
Deep down in his sorrows
Will you run and will you share your light
See its when we're giving hope
That we know that we can grow.
The streets don't give a damn
They're filled with such pollution
The kids don't stand a chance
We're trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hand
We're filled with so much hatred
I got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me
I got the magic in me
These tricks that I'll attempt will blow your mind
I got the magic in me
Well take a journey into my mind
You'll see why it's venom I rhyme
See I deceive you with my intergalactic ether
Hey hey do you wanna be famous
They wanna taste that
Fame fame fame fame fame
Most people wanna just taste it
When I'm up on the stage they sing it but soon as I step off they hate it
And I'm saying I really ain't with that complaining just look at the picture I'm painting
If you witness the condition that my brain is in
Hey hey do you wanna be famous
They wanna taste that
Fame fame fame fame fame
Cause everybody just wanna be on MTV or BET or
But I don't know maybe this is just how it's supposed to be
You can go crazy and beat on drums
Hey hey do you wanna be famous
They wanna taste that
Fame fame fame fame fame
Hey hey do you wanna be famous
They wanna taste that
Fame fame fame fame fame
Hey hey do you wanna be famous
They wanna taste that
Maybe one day we can go
Hand in hand down a golden road
And if I get there before you go
In the future hopefully
We'll be together you and me
Don't you worry baby please
Both the hands of time
Still I would never find
Maybe one day girl I pray
We can float off to space
Hold my hand I'll lead the way
And I won't let go and fall astray
Don't you worry baby please
Both the hands of time
Still I would never find
I love her more than myself and still that ain't enough
I'd have countless sky miles
Enough to show my urge for her smile
I'd shout on the curb with a loudspeaker
Maybe one day we can go
Hand in hand down a golden road
And if I get there before you go
In the future hopefully
We'll be together you and me
Don't you worry baby please
Both the hands of time
Still I would never find
I wanna ride on my cosmic highway
Look shorty I can't stay here on the earth no more
Another galaxy we must go.
I wanna ride on my cosmic highway
Look shorty I can't stay here on the earth no more
Another galaxy we must go.
But I can't stay here on the earth no more
Now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
On the first week I did five hundred thousand
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they called me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination
Like I didn't write raps up in all of my classes
Like I never used to run away into the blackness
Now let's pretend like I ain't got a name
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever noticed my face
So let's just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes
And it seems like yesterday
And it seems like yesterday
Let's pretend things would have been no different
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind
Marshall you're never gonna make it
Makes no sense to play the game
There ain't no way that you'll win
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools were changing again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
You need to get your cranium checked
You thinking like an alien it just ain't realistic
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed it
And his alarm went off to wake him off
But he didn't make it to the rap Olympics
Slept through his plane and he missed it
But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even here
The country is in need of me
And I heard there were signs for war
So I'm going overseas
The skies above will cry for you
And I'll be safe so hopefully
I'll come back home for you
Tell me it's not true
After all the love I've given
You found someone new
What you can't replace
That I promised you I would keep
A thousand deaths I died that day
A greater force pulled you away
So I got on my knees and begged
The silence replaced my tears
Tell me it's not true
After all the love I've given
You found someone new
What you can't replace
As I bid farewell to thee
All is fair in love and war
No I don't need no lingo
Yeah shoot it up like a free throw
From the west to the east coast
Lemme get a second just to reload
Don't think that I lost my touch by much
Had to get my papers straight
So don't think that I ain't sick
That I'm in places you can't get
When you're inside of the matrix
High like every race in
Tick me off and I'm like lit up
So I wouldn't do that
Still wouldn't defeat
Then I wipe with an MC
Throw them in the trash
Wait a minute maybe just switch up the flow
I was on a whole different level but now I'm ready to level
With a hellfire venomous flow
I'm in a place you can't really be
And when you inside you just kinda know
And if you will then I know you don't
And if you not then you go for broke
But this a jungle let me go for those
To all my smokers and my hundred blunt rollers
Check me out now. Check me out now
Allow me to introduce myself again
Bob's out the office but Bobby Ray is in
And every time I come around I look like I'm a pimp
Slap her on that booty with a hundred dollar bill
Just so that my job doesn't get monotonous
Put it in the air like I'm levitating shit
The game's in a drought
It was going down the drain
Come back get a sack full of that like whoa
So listen two me rap sit back like whoa
Need to get round two in
I really couldn't tell you what the main objective is
Cause really that depends
On if you got a hit or just a good song that they never ever spin
And then that depends on the genre that you in
If you're a rock artist or a hip hop blend
That's where I come in
They try to box me in
But I am not a square nor a parallelogram
Yes I got several fans through Japan to Maryland
They try to shoot me down but I never ever land
And no man could never ever walk in my pants
Or live what I've lived
All up in this booth try to lay this shit down
And don't turn the dial
Okay Bob hit the stage now
Lights and cameras on
What a spectacular form
From the blood sweat and the tears shed
But I'm just as human as you
And they telling me I have so much dope I won't know what to do with it
I look in the mirror and laugh
Like look at what I've become
Everyone calls me Bob but I'm still my mother's son
It's easy to see I ain't into fame
Please allow me to demonstrate
But no matter what they say
I stay charged up like a triple A
The crowd is rushing the court.
And it seems like they're chanting for...
Put me anywhere on the map with a backpack strapped
Plus they know when I come to the court this is my sport
Bet I'm on a brand new plane
Bet I'm in a whole different zone
I ain't really from this place
So I'm up all night long
Really I'm in outer space
Really I ain't got no home
Impossible to copy like what everybody try to do
We cool as some dudes on them waves out in Malibu
And I'm still representing
Okay so I'm on the beat
I probably shouldn't be smoking so much my mind is over fried
But still I notice how
Them same folks will smile in your face
But behind your back them same folk will frown
I owe it to the streets
And yeah I gotta eat cause my groceries on this beat
And my song will carry on till I no longer speak
My soul is also Kosher added to the fact I'm cheap
And I put that on my grandma Othella so
A many blessings sent from heaven thanking God to be alive
I'm headed to the top I couldn't be more welcome
That's for the crown holders
Never would I dethrone
But if you ever leave home don't worry I keep your seat warm
But is clear with no tints man just check the fingerprints
You'll see we not the same
I got a shit list with lot's of names
Then it's who shot ya man
Finally figured out the game
Wake up now or say your prayers
Put it down your newspaper
Hello there bad news anchor
We don't want no more favors
To the sky is what we aim for
The ticking clock The tick clock
Is counting down counting down
Like 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...
Your out of time out of time
There's nothing to wait for
Don't let it weigh you down... down... down... down...
Release all these demons
They must be defeated
Eventually some time this century
But people will bleed if we don't come to grips with
They never solve it defenseless
And still we so senseless
The ticking clock The tick clock
Is counting down counting down
Like 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...
Your out of time out of time
Don't let it weigh you down
Don't let it weigh you
I step into the place like so
That thing that you need
That thing that you know
If we was at sea I would not be a boat
Right next to the P like L M N O
There is no expression
No word or phrase I know
That would accurately describe
The way I feel the most
You know I like the most
Cause this is my job like it ain't nobody's business
Yeah yeah real dirty real gritty
And you know we like move
Now we change up the tune
I think it's noon and we still ain't through
And it's just so nasty
That's why the sex is so damn fantastic
You ain't gotta ask me
Kids close your ears cause this right here is graphic
Like we in Atlanta in the Caddy
Now my confidence feels awfully fantastic
Well I'm a quit this crazy scene
Cause being famous ain't all what they make it to be
But back then y'all this was my favorite dream
I'm a quit this crazy scene
Cause everything you see ain't really how it be
Please don't believe in that TV screen
I'm sorry kids but there's no such thing
Well I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
Cause this is what I waited to be
And I don't know how to feel
Dream of mine used to be so real
I would anything just to sign a deal
But now I trade it all for a home cooked meal
I'm only human y'all so we all gotta work
But sometimes I wonder why I even came to this earth
I want out of these cuffs
Sometimes I just feel hopeless
It ain't supposed to be so hard
I always said I'd quit if it felt like a job
I'd rather be pissed than pretend that I'm not
And try to play along with the whole facade
It ain't a question to me
I know what I'm destined to be
This is spiritual y'all
And I don't even wanna be famous
And all my close friends become complete strangers
Don't try to tell me this is one of these stages
But still it just ain't enough
It couldn't be more fake
When they wine and they dine and they smile and wave
But when it comes time to decide your fate
They'll sign you on the line right next to Satan
I can look in your eyes and tell you what you done been through
And I could give a fuck because I got bigger issues
So at this point in my life
And use it as a chance to provide some change
Just know I'll walk away at the end of the day
This is my stress reliever
So I get up in this booth and I'm heated
A lot of haters attack but
It's my job to speak the truth on the track
And there you are standing all alone in the rain
And the rain comes pouring down
It feels good when it enters my veins
And every time I wake up it's a similar day
But this is what I get for my troublesome ways
So here comes the rain to fuck up my parade
I ain't got nothing to say
And there you are standing all alone in the rain
And the rain comes pouring down
And as I fall into the rain
Higher than the mountains feeling lower than the plains
And there you are standing all alone in the rain
And the rain comes pouring down
They said hip hop was stacked
I must have missed the funeral
Well see what happen was
They started assuming stuff
So when I am in the room with her
That's what I do to her
I send her ass to Jupiter
And when I'm through with her
I go extra extra hard
I'm in this thing for the bread
I ain't in for friends
And yeah I spit it off the brain
And no I can't pretend
Okay so let me tell you what I'm interested in
Well you know who it is
You ain't even got to ask it
I am not the best I am the next level past it
And they say I'm like a zombie
Cause all I want is brains
Cause all these dimes
But baby this is all I can provide
I'm on top of the world and I'm so high
I gotta drop down just to catch my flight
But I rock with this stuff
So my stocks just went up
But since you critics want to be that adamant
I guess I give you reason to type on your keypad again
My life is not an ordinary story
This is just how I feel about the situation that I'm in
Your girl says she like that country smooth drawl
That's why there's groupies ready to remove draws
They be going heavy duty till that Goose gone
Every single day I wake up to a new song
So to all the people that's about to hate it
So my style is addictive like simple lemonade is
You can feel the tension and the sense of mental stimulation
If she's with me than she's not your lady
Mostly because they raised me
Yeah I'm just saying how I feel up in this booth
Well I don't feel so good today
I guess I'll drift away
Because this system is a cage
Like the prison gates
Then how come Independence Day
Well excuse my expression
But I don't give a fuck today
So there's not much to say
Well I went to my bed
But crazy thoughts kept running through my head
Well if you were my mirror
Then you would see a very sad look on my face
The life of Bobby Ray
Well if I gave you a few words to show my most genuine emotion
They would not describe the way I feel inside
Actually you would have to experience an explosion
From my toes to the top of my head
And in between my shoulders
If ya don't know than you probably can't focus
The youths so blind but they eyes wide open
Saw the girl of my fantasy
She was into finer things
Bathing suits and diamond belly rings
She was something like I never seen
Made me blow the whistle like the referee
Beside her is where I plan to be
And so to get her I'd do anything
Maybe even start a family
Or even get a house in Sandy Springs
She's so lovely like a melody
Like the other side of a pillow
Well come on over to my place
No need to be wasting time
You really must be from outer pace
Cause you really is blowing my mind
Now I done been from state to state
But I ain't never seen your kind
Cause every single time I look at you
Sends a tingling down my spine
Running these laps through my mind so often
The things you do when you brush your hair
When you take it to the side and toss it over there
Like the other side of a pillow
Cool like a pool in the middle of June
I sweep her off her feet
I guess you could say that I give her the broom
And she gets so international with it
Whenever she get in the mood
When she go in for the gold
A lady in the bed but a freak in the room
Like a smoothie in a jacuzzi
The opposite of Judge Judy
And she feeling me too
Like the other side of a pillow
Saw the girl of my fantasy
She was into finer things
Bathing suits and diamond belly rings
She was something like I've never seen
Made me blow the whistle like the referee
Inside her is where I plan to be
And so to get her I'd do anything
Maybe even start a family
Or even get a house in Sandy Springs
She's so lovely like a melody
Like the other side of a pillow
Like the other side of a pillow
Well come on over to my place
No need to be wasting time
You really must be from Outer Space
Now I done been from state to state
But I ain't never seen your kind
Sends a tingling down my spine
Running these laps through my mind so often
The things you do when you brush your hair
When you take it to the side and toss it over there
Like the other side of a pillow
Like the other side of a pillow
Cool like a pool in the middle of June
I sweep her off her feet
I guess you could say that I give her the broom
And she gets so international with it
Whenever she get in the mood
When she go in for the gold
Like a smoothie and jacuzzi
The opposite of Judge Judy
And she feeling me too
Like the other side of a pillow
Like the other side of a pillow
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We got attached to the fact we attracted
You know I'm an addict and
So if you get close then you can't go backwards
I know I'm kinda like a black hole in a galaxy
You are trapped beneath my galactic habits
But I was just so blind
You haven't called up at the perfect time
But I couldn't see it. I said I couldn't see it
Who sadly fell in love
With a girl who couldn't love
With a girl who couldn't love
And now I'm sad in love
For the girl who couldn't love
Yeah I was a fool for love
Yeah I was a fool for love
Yeah I was a fool for love
Lemme tell ya bout my ex
Left with her sister but whenever she left I would miss her
Lady dropped me like a cut in a track
But I was just so blind
You haven't called up at the perfect time
But I couldn't see it. I said I couldn't see it
Who sadly fell in love
With a girl who couldn't love
With a girl who couldn't love
And now I'm sad in love
For the girl who couldn't love
Yeah I was a fool for love
Yeah I was a fool for love
Yeah I was a fool for love
Beautiful girls all over the world
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
It's so much nonsense it's on my conscience
I'm thinking maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant
Beautiful girls all over the world
I've been around and I've never seen another one
No other girl's on my brain and you the one to blame
I really don't know how long I've been doing this shit
I need some space so please someone make me some room in this bitch
Give me those beats I eat those
All day I don't sleep no
I don't even know what I got sheets for
But see I do this beat for
Back in the hood at east shows
So we take hood wherever we go
Yes I committed myself to the game
Don't be letting them tell you them lies
We make the industry real when it's fake
Excuse my language but I'm fed up with the same shit
My momma told me all this back when I was nameless
I ride around and they praise me
I crack a smile and they waving
From the DEC so the east side's up
Fired up so you know when I get to the booth I go Ham
Running at a hundred kilometers
This is not a fucking game
Ain't no referee's involved
This is military combat soldiers standing guard round my yard
I swear I see everything that's a bit
Man I'm fed up to my neck with the stress
I could use a wish Hayley where you at
I guess the only exception to these girls is that I rap
But sometimes I wonder
I don't give a fuck about numbers so I do find it ironic
And they say that I went pop and the streets say
And call me supersonic I shake the earth beneath ya
Hell yeah you heard of me it's quite a emergency
But if you wanna work for me then girl you need your working visas
And if you ain't working then you just should not converse with me
I'm caught up in her Matrix and I think it's time to reload
And if this is what I caught girl I would have to appeal
I think that the defendant have some things that must reveal
Had the kind of... into her motor roller
This bout to get scary like the end of October
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
So cold like a hobo wearing no clothes and it's snow globe when the temperature is below froze
Man I'm already famous historically so my story is already glorious
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
They wondering how I deal with the fame
Shout out to all the ladies
I don't know why I have to say this but
I'm into deep sea diving
I go deeper than the Navy
I'm crazy crazy crazy
They say I'm amazing but
Todays world the craziest
To make the main page
Just to be a daily topic of a conversation
So call me Dr. Bob yes I'm on the job
She say I'm like a teacher before she lights my yard
Stick to the script take a shit in your draws
And I don't need to take you number girl this ain't no casting call
And if this where we battle we would be worthy opponents
I had to get up on it
Kinda how you do a pony
It's kinda like a bank
Who get down in Atlanta
This here should be your weather
I'm a still be hear when the sun comes up
When the sun comes up who'll still be here
With ball and a bat give me one more plaque
So I guess I might as well turn things up
All the bad girls in the building just shake it
I'm a bring you home with em
But I'm a just go fast like a baseball throw
Hell yeah she know she bad
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
Dude never lose even when you think he can't even win
Hurry up somebody better check our temperature
On the fire titan like the movie they remember us
Look mama no guns and I'm still G
And keep it real we try yet and still we die out in the battle field but don't nobody feel me
I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
So when you talk about the greats you got to mention me
Flawless with symmetry
Empty refrigerators all I see up in my memory
So cold with it you would think that I invented it
All day back and forth like tennis is
Another day at the office to handle business
From the beginning I sprinted knew where the finish is
I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I heard the tip I won't and shame on they ass
Since the presence is a gift I won't refrain from the past
I'm a young stunner focused and ready to smash
If my feet don't fail me I shall be crowned
But they never failed me before why would they fail now
I'm the one to call on look how they kept it down
I made they ass I'm made to last
I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
You may not know my name
But by the time I leave you
Remember the B. to the O. to the B.
And every single dot that's in between
And every time I hop up in the scene
I'm ready for whatever
If you feel me let me know
But I don't even sweat it anymore
I get up in the zone as I coast
Gravity better hold me tight
Your relativity don't mold me right
On every single kick every snare every line
I'm down for the gamble like a red pair of dice
You scared of the fight
When you lay down and prepare for the night
I'll be in the air on a flight
I don't even care what the time
High in the days of my mind
Making every nightclub jump like raves
East side Atlanta that's where I stay
Higher than you've ever been
Higher than you've ever been
Cause there's a place
Higher than you've ever been
What am I to tell you
Streets never gave a drunk number
Do it for the date till there ain't none left
Beat a bitch back like a trunk full of amps
Posted up drunk on the streets like lamps
Say they want beats instead of shows on the wall
Know every time that I hit that stage I don't do it for myself
Man I do it for us all
They wanna go high so I take flight
Higher than you've ever been
Higher than you've ever been
Cause there's a place
Higher than you've ever been
Higher than you've ever been
Higher than you've ever been
Higher than you've ever been
Just when you won't find a better medicine
I would highly recommend that you smoking in the suite
Everyday I wake up and I try to set a trend
Now I'm in a country that you've never been
Haters turn me in when it comes to green
Get your dog shot like a veterinarian
She's probably yo girl if she's cute and petite
Higher than you've ever been
Higher than you've ever been
Cause there's a place
Higher than you've ever been
Put your seat belt on then adjust your position and lean back
While you in time frozen
With a bad broad that'll pull fire
Underground King due to my empire
Higher than you've ever been
Higher than you've ever been
Cause there's a place
Higher than you've ever been
Shoot up the television with Rutgers and demolition
It's time we fucked the system in missionary position
It's my intention for giving this transition
Come up in my position
The product of my condition
Put a business plan in my hand and a vision of a politician
It's funny how we're never what we witness
Cause this is broadcast television from the villa to the village
On your corporate main frame
We don't want that watered down
Take back that Diet Coke
This is not a protest
Better yet a gang bang
I'm in a distant realm
I beat the game already
Now I'm just trying to coach
The signal is gonna fade it
The television is a berry
Well we all live in the belly
Inhabitants of the concrete jungle to Silicon Valley
A holographic anatomy
Really I'm on the ship with the Planetary Academy
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost
They gave me nothing but doubt
First they waited then hated then counted me out
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck
They say I lost my way
Right in front of their face
Well this is the world that we living
One minute you the hero the next you the villain
We got up in this game just to try to make a living
We hit you with the truth while you watching television
But still these are the cards that we dealt
They kick you on the ground when you most need help
Until you dried up and they sit you on the shelf
Then you start to cry because you all by yourself
So just know if you are aware of the belt
The only way to excel is the soul that you sell
So I could care less about the clothes on myself
I'm trying to drive straight on a road made of nails
Or else it would be another story to tell
I'm getting to the door I can tell
I'm just waiting on the day till the glory prevails
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost
They gave me nothing but doubt
First they waited then hated then counted me out
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck
They say I lost my way
Right in front of their face
Used to wanna have the bricks on lock
Till we went to prison saw we couldn't pick them locks
Listen if I ain't the realest ever done it I ain't off by much
And it's a marathon pace yourself
I'm looking back and laughing this life of mine
Bought me all the way here form my life of crime
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost
They gave me nothing but doubt
First they waited then hated then counted me out
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck
They say I lost my way
Right in front of their face
I'll be on the top 40 with a big hit
And then after that I'll be famous
And everyone I know will tell me that I'm changing
And then my cell phone will never stop ringing
And I'll be all over magazine pages
Yeah and they'll play my songs till they boring
And if I ever do stop touring they treat me like a foreigner
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost
They gave me nothing but doubt
First they waited then hated then counted me out
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck
They say I lost my way
Well me and her were the 2
Me and her were together like glue
But we lived packed in a shack
Like the old lady who lived in a shoe
And we ain't really know what to do
So we got together with the crew
And planned everything with the T
We got gloves and guns and bags and masks
And anything we would need
So we scoped out the facility
Really waited a couple of weeks.
Till it was time to kick in the door
Everyone down it's a robbery
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You left me cold tonight
But nobody suspected a thing
It was quite a spectacular act
So we get to the safe out of everyone's sight
So I take off my mask and ask
The look she had on her face was cold as ice
Before she could she could say the next word I heard the sirens pull out outside
She was on the clock so I guess nobody would think she was in on the crime
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You left me cold tonight
So I realized it was over
When the SWAT team kicked in the door
And they took me into the station
And they started the interrogation
Ans I stand there in amazement
Trying to find an explanation
And the cops come in and restrain me
How can you turn your back on me you're selfish I hate you
All I ever wanted to do love you
So I snatched the gun from my officer
And I cocked it and I aimed it
With 55 hundred to go
When you love a girl who is as cold as ice
Eventually you'll get froze
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You left me cold tonight
32 degrees below zero
You're like 31 flavors you're oh so cold
Feels like 30 straight days of falling snow
You're like 32 degrees below zero
Or like 31 flavors you're oh so cold
Feels like 30 straight days of falling snow
You left me cold tonight
You're willing to sacrifice our love
The same thing happened eon's ago
To know exactly you have to read up some more
Everyday technology speeds up some more
Some roll with angels and demons and ghosts
And y'all ain't seen shit but y'all already scared
But you'll probably be the same one hating
Saying every rapper is in the Free Masons
So do your research and make ya own mind up
While the clock keeps handing y'all hours
But pucker up because the truth gets sour
More sour than the sour diesel I devour
When I brain storm it's like a shower
So pull out your towels
And if you good at something make sure they pay you
And if not take a thank you
It's all about the attention that they pay you
Y'all on that grape drink
Shouts to Grand Hustle
We got that break through
Really there ain't no one else ahead of us
It's the representer from the east side of Atlanta
That's known as Decatur
I got my own lane but I can't see the road
My rear view mirror's full of haters
It's me they cannot battle
Yes I am what they after
I'm a natural born disaster
I'm the reason your momma tell you not hang with rappers
But your momma is a minister and I'm her favorite rapper
I wonder what she's after
But don't get it confused
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
It's just a different day with the same shit
It's just a different day with the same shit
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
Things just ain't what I used to know
Things just ain't what I used to know
And groupies fall in holes that gold diggers dug
I don't need no pencil though be consider a general
Girls be jigging on they tippy toes
So she take me in like her vitamins and minerals
Leaping over barriers like this was a triathlon
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
It's just a different day with the same shit
It's just a different day with the same shit
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
Things just ain't what I used to know
Things just ain't what I used to know
Now I'm the everyday topic
I'm under the microscope so I'm feeling microscopic
My shit was fading to black
But made it to the next step like recovering alcoholics
Veins filled with Novocaine
So I ain't even feeling y'all
I ain't even hearing y'all
Fingernails on a blackboard
They say the pen is way mightier than the sword
Till your faith is restored by the lord of this rap shit
Let's line up all the factors
Grew up in the hood but was raised in the burbs
Real pops wasn't there
So the military made me a man
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
It's just a different day with the same shit
It's just a different day with the same shit
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
Things just ain't what I used to know
And I put on my shades
But everyone knew that I was lying
If you look at my face
And the way that I behave
You will still see a disguise
It's not that hard to find
Cause most of the time
I'm American sleeping
The average listener is blind to the fact
That my mind has been tapped
I carry the World as it lies on my back
Please pay me no mind as I laugh
This is all a stage every line is an act
Killing the American dream with a trap
I'm a put it in the back of the black Cadillac
Some say that I'm throw like a javelin
Then break off the mold to normalities
People called the election a tragedy
Looking at the screen like this can't be happening
I ain't saying that I'm some kind of activist
But something be attacking us
I was filling my time just posing
Like a mannequin you pass by
Where the girls ain't hard to find
All the time I was just searching
A plastic promised land
But a dream is nothing
And it's everything at the same time
So you never know when you might wake up
And find you was just living a lies
He the freshest from his fitted down to the shoes and socks
A reminder for those of you who forget
177 Aston Martin cash and carry off the lot
We're gonna be smoking the city when I come kicking come and witness
Catch up with me suckers gonna need a solid month of Wendy
Many moons will it take you buffoons and many goons
Or maybe you've been sleeping or snoozing on me before
And everybody surprised now
3 years down the road
But where was everybody when albums wasn't in stores
Who cares if it ain't fair
Talking record labels corporations this is entertainment
You don't see the star in me
Pressure becomes combustible
Wheels squeezing the arteries of haters
Plus my uncle is Quincy Jones so pardon me
Block you like a histamine
This is really history
Like Elmo y'all tickle me
Why I still be ripping beats
Well this is the mysterious case
Looking after her patients was her only obligation but
That was back before back before the situation
Before she got a visit from an agent
He introduced himself as an employee of the nation
He asked would she'd be willing to offer cooperation
You fit the job description and all the qualifications
If interested I need your signature on this paper
She signed the dotted line without the slightest hesitation
She then received a letter stating the rules and regulations and the military bases where she must be relocated
She is not to discuss any business that's work related
On a classified location
Before border control
Before a illegal immigration
Chemicals are manipulated
She's very concentrated
But her concentrations broken
When she hears a conversation
Small talk about destabilization and
Inside a unlocked office she did some investigation
She breaks into a file with
Top secret information
Probably some of the most disturbing documentation
She ever saw in her life
The article simply stated
A study being conducted on human civilization
Deep down inside she wished it was all her imagination
She couldn't doubt it
Cause there it clearly stated
She works in a facility where viruses are created
But member when she had her patients
She wrote out prescriptions for what she thought was medication
Her office was really just a part of the operation
She wipes her eyes as they water full of frustration
How a victim of government experimentation
Where's the justification
Where's the justification
Where's the judge when you need him
Hes probably on a vacation
Probably inside of the same countries that these events takes place in
But as the puzzle pieces fall into proper arrangement
Yes we began to see the intentions of these creations
The patterns of epidemics like
Biological chemicals designed to be contagious
Can't say her name but we were two
I grabbed her waist and we would move
And then one day we were through
And by the way I must be true
Cause all I ever wanted was to act on my attraction
I never meant to hurt you that's just my natural reaction
Okay okay okay okay I know I know
Well I liked you I ain't just want sex
First time you walked by everybody scream hair squad on deck
But you still was cool I'm a get real with you
Which one appeal to you
But I ain't too mad cause at the end of the night
But this the least I can do
So this right here's for you
Cause all I ever wanted was to act on my attraction
I never meant to hurt you that's just my natural reaction
You the one at the bar in the back
And all that ass got you caught us fast
And you came back with us and we all got smashed
Funny how an autograph turned into all of that
Just call me the bedroom bandit
Cause after one night stands I vanish
And no I can't understand it
I don't think one man on this planet does
Cause all I ever wanted was to act on my attraction
I never meant to hurt you that's just my natural reaction
Well if you're trying to stop me it don't matter
I got the power of a 40 caliber
Better call you a police and ambulance
Slower than four legged animals
And I leap in the air like a catapult
Look way up there it's a bird it's a plane
No it's the savior to change the game
Getting a little bit now
The neural path I've traveled has immediate reaction
A fraction or a fragment of me actually is present
Freedom isn't found inside a visa or a crown
Mortals are immortal when their soul has been imported
This is the warmest moment of a poet turned heroic
Tie the game like a shot from outside when it's 95 to 98
So I can't spell and can't mail it out
And went and took all the bitches of the athletes
And a new fitted cap that I ain't wore out yet
On my last trip to Sydney in the Sheraton lobby
And pull a bottle out that cabinet while that kitchen's warm
I come from the school of hard knocks and overachievers
To be the voice of the people and go against all this evil
Where people say it doesn't matter to be much
I just want to say I remember when
Or things could get heated and you'll get ferociously beat
You know who it is without a doubt of hesitation
If money talks I got my masters in communication
But you can't hold a conversation
Probably find me burning something good you can call that smoking aces
Compliment the chef in the lab making greatness
Ain't a thing changed but the number on the statement
Praise yo solo that the freaks in the backseat
Get a thrill off the alpine when it vibrate they ass cheeks
I'm Bobby Ray baby an all American athlete
I run and leap and jump and like a track meet
Yeah that ought to do it
Give it that Carl Lewis
I got the magic baby call me George Lucas
I'm so prolific but my flows so foolish
Clean like a baby wipe
Y'all just a momma boy sleeping with a baby like
My ex say I'm a dick cause my mind frank cocky
Damn right I want a double fried rice
I'm getting bread I put my dick up in your face
I'm looking for pay day
Liquor and wheelbarrow foolish as Will Ferrell
New shit dropping soon Patron and Instrumental
I tap her on the head and tell her you know the procedure
Haters be getting defensive like 4th down and show blitz
I'm the shit so fix the plumbing
I'm smoking on hydroponic some of you call that chronic
Lil C got that beat bumping so you can hear me coming
All my haters rest in peace
I make a hundred on the Monday and go hard the rest of week
See your artist that's a feast
Wait a minute I'm a menace
Shout out to the winners
I bring that order back
This is how my day go
Got a tour bus with a room in it
Yes I put it over a time to mix it
That's school and put the beat it at the school detention
Got me Captain Hook man after low murder make me a burger
I'm so further like the place that you ain't heard of pound worker
See I get out hand to my building I am so ambitious
So when I walk around that's fitness I pass fur when I visit
Overseas ball no pivot you talk about it and I love it
Since day one you heard me
From the underground to the surface
With a booty so big you can probably Google Earth it
It's been a long time coming
And the clock says a quarter to 4
I'm feeling like it's now or never
And your bodies telling me it's a go
On a late night weekend showcase event
Kind of liked you at first but I noticed your friend
So I got my folks to approach both of them
And they both came over and we poured up some hen
Cause you don't have to speak when you know
It's about that time we should go
So allow me to flow as I propose a toast
To the good life on a good night we go
Grab a bottle and go tell her hold on
Yes a beautiful night
But as soon as you went to the room I guess you froze
It's been a long time coming
And the clock says a quarter to 4
I'm feeling like it's now or never
And your bodies telling me it's a go
It's the end of the week but the first of the month
When the moon gets full but the night is still young
With a crowd like this you don't know where you'll end up
And I didn't know what you were thinking
But your eyes said enough
And everything we felt was obvious lust
Which I thought was kinda cool I ain't gonna bluff
But look at the clock
No need to be in a rush
But later you can hit me up so you hit me up
Shoes at the door smoke in the air temperatures up
But I guess when the lights went out it froze you up
It's been a long time coming
And the clock says a quarter to 4
I'm feeling like it's now or never
And your bodies telling me it's a go
There's no need to move or adjust your television
But these American cages have American bars
We hunted for truth so we headed for y'all.
Looking at time move progressively forward
Looking the days just vanish before me.
Now you were killed to put your foot in the tourist
It's a different madness and never look backwards
I want to be a part of it
Breaker breaker 9 breaker breaker 1 9
We ain't waiting on the line for a 9 1 1 9 9
Whatever man I ain't got time for all this nonsense.
Enemy responses ain't a dial tone in our home on the continent
So we break the peace to get a piece of what we want to get
Let them know we run this shit
And let them know just how you feel the way your country is
Now look how beautiful destruction is
Start spreading the news
I want to be a part of it
On the battlefield I am not commandeering
Where's the mainly man...
Busting like Sammy Sam
Niggers can't even see me on the beta
Like a black... standing a bad exam
The more I ball the more the haters run
Reaching out the other artist for a wider view
In reality artists just don't have the time for you
I mean... I'm all about my...
I don't smoke ... and I'm never on a...
So keep up my yard and never touch my...
I'm about to show what a hell is...
So now we gonna see what's up and what's good
I say I throw to the side
I swear tonight I'm doing major damage
But we ride in slow motion
Its whatever I never let up
A house for the freaks
And ill never say never
My jackets all leather
Got peter pissed off cause my pillow full of feathers
Woofers in my cushion ...
If I want it then I cop
What you pop pills for
How bout we get some strippers and go crazy with the cheese
How bout buy some bottles and make movies till we G.
How bout buy some bottles and make movies till we G.
How bout we go to Magic and Onyx in the same night
How bout I get the racks and go shopping everyday this month
How bout I go to Pluto and go crazy with them bands
How bout I go to space and never come back ever again
How bout we sneak the lean inside the club it's time to play
How bout we get some Strippers and go crazy with the cheese
How bout buy some bottles and make movies till we G.
How bout we get some Strippers and go crazy with the cheese
How bout buy some bottles and make movies till we G.
And I've lost my soul
Way too fucked up obviously
But that's what just happens when the bottles are free
Prestige like an older man
I'm laid up in the sweet like Solomon
You all just following.
I do my thing certainly
I'm getting... at the Hon Kong spot
Tell a broad with a big... bring a ...
I can't see you fuck boys...
Hit a freak on one... call it captain Morgan
Getting hurt with the true fucking...
Call it... over no fat Jesus
The way I ride on the beat man
And all we do is light it up
And all we do is light it up
And all we do is light it up
And all we do is light it up
I guess I must invest in the proper form of protection
And all we do is light it up
She could persuade a million soldiers into the dark
As the war between light and darkness continues
Heroes and villains become harder to identify
Kindred spirits separated at birth
Fighting for their place in time to be solidified
The clock ticks faster and faster
The beginning of the calm before the storm
And I swear it's like a fucked up reality
But I don't have to act in it
And they don't make a television that handles the frequencies of my channel
And there ain't no computer that can hack it
It just don't have the capacity
Drink wine out of chalices on Sunday like we Catholics
They call this a game because it is exactly
The world's run by a few people and we never seen them at all
You can be whatever you want
You could be a star with a car with a house made out of gold
Now I be beast mode up on these bars
Freak out a beat and then beat it up raw
Better watch out when you cross my yard
Look at the crowd as soon as I start
Look in they eyes and look in they hearts
Two middle fingers straight at the law
UFOs don't make any noise
As the mask of deception falls off the face of humanity
Unveiling the grim reality of duality
Truth has many shades
You wanna pop bottles until you're on the floor
Hang with all the models and all the centerfolds
She wants them Ray Bands cause them bands are gorgeous
She looking for a sponsor and I ain't talking corporate
She after that endorsement
Ever since she saw me on the Forbes list
She be getting zero's from heroes
She from Atlanta but she on that college strand
Compliments of Bobby Ray
You wanna pop bottles until you're on the floor
Hang with all the models and all the centerfolds
You see business over bullshit's my company policy
So let me know if it's all right
You're losing control
You wanna pop bottles until you're on the floor
Hang with all the models and all the centerfolds
Since day 1 I said fuck the fame and everything it dealt
But the fame is really here just to facilitate the wealth
But the wealth attracts you haters like you mosquitoes to a well
And the waters getting deeper so I'm well set out to sail
That said congratulations on the million record sales
As I'm flipping over furniture knocking shit off the shelf
I told myself I'll never get too deep not to take a breathe
And even more so to sleep when no one cares
Yeah I've seen the valley of the shadow of death
That's why I sing about it
I just try to move on and keep my peace about it
That's why I'm always smiling but on this beat I seem so violent
Just yesterday I was rapping with my brother and my cousin
If you had the stove or toaster on you couldn't use the oven
So all I see is magazine covers in this game
You either surface or you plummet
And it's so hard to breathe
And even more so to sleep when no one cares
And it's so hard to breathe
And even more so to sleep when no one cares
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Ever thought about losing it
When your money's all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that you due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Open up the fridge about twenty times
But still can't find no food in it
And the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
Everybody ain't a number one draft pick
Most of us ain't Hollywood actors
Do it one time for the underdogs
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us
That you could drown in a puddle
For all the times no one's ever spoke for us
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that that's what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath get so deep
And you feel like you're just another person
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
And if life hadn't chosen us
Do it one time for the underdogs
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us
The way I ride on the beat man
And all we do is light it up
And all we do is light it up
And all we do is light it up
And all we do is light it up
I guess I must invest in the proper form of protection
And all we do is light it up
Drinking a German beer with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican bar
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Girl tell me how you feel
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up
You'll be in the high life
Soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I had you living life like you should
You say you never had it so good
You never had it so good
Suffering from first class cabin fever
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza
Still lean to the left like the tower out in Pisa
I'm feeling single baby
I could use a feature
You never had it so good
Well I been feeling singular
We'll Barcelona bounce
You never had it so good
You never had it so good
You never had it so good
You never had it so good
You never had it so good
We only play for keeps
But the drinks are on us
If you with it then pull up a seat
When you're roaming through the jungle
What other rule there's left to break
I guess my faith is a quest for me
Man got a dog and ain't got no leash
Man got a floater that got no brain
Better do your research
Feeling like I fell out of the sky and landed feet first
Now keep them bottles coming by the killer liter
But a dying breed survives and a dynasty immerse
So put it in for out if you entirely concur
And they say that I look higher in person
I lived the actual version of the fantasies they utter
My heart is going cold so I gotta sleep with warmer covers
I made it out alive but still the battle is a struggle
The masters have murdered the game
And their name wasn't in the will
And they jealous of my success cause my shoes cost more than their bill
But I'll never sit down at another table unless I'm invited to the meal
Remember the images in your mirror can be bigger than they appear
And by the looks it's about the time that you had your prescription sealed
There's no debating when you let your numbers make the statement
We only play for keeps
But the drinks are on us
If anybody feeling fresh in the building
I know they feeling me now
And if you too fresh in the building
I know they feeling me now
And I'm still here with a lifestyle you would kill for
And I'm never that hard to find because 420 is my zip code
What would you do in the middle of the winter
And my brother was always fresher
So that's why now this the type of life that I live for
And I'm still here with a black whip from the strange clouds
With the soul of a soldier but even still I don't want no parts
My nightlife's like a soap opera with two chicks like it's Noah's ark
But I always knew I'd go far bike a gas truck with no park
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my fucking mind
Then my brain left and it didn't say bye
So paranoid of espionage
I'm watching my doors and checking my blinds
I am a rebel but yes I'm so militant
Still I'm eligible for disabilities
I am psychotic but there is no remedy
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my fucking mind
When my goons come through and start shooting stars
I'm kinda drunk off blue Bacardi
I told Baby when I get my new advance
That's why they thinking I'm Illuminati
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my fucking mind
I can't seem to come out of it
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my fucking mind
They can take these clothes off my back
They can take my money
Don't care about that
They can't take my words
They can have this fame
As she takes the stand
By the look in her eyes I can tell that's she knows
That she's holding the faith of my world in her hands
This was never the plan
It was never intended for her to end up to defend
And I guess it just happened by chance
You played at the George just to bring that down
Just so you can go back and avoid a disaster
And you could still be holding her hand
Like the last note of the saddest song
We're like the last word at the end of the poem
It's funny how you never know what you got till it's gone
They can take these clothes off my back
They can take my money
They can have this fame
Who if they committed a crime you would stop on a dime and do time for
And that was her that I cried for
Now I'd give it all away to get her back
But there's some things in this life that you gotta do
I'd let it all go but I ain't dropping you
They can take my money
They can't take my words
They can have this fame
It might be wrong or it might be right
But there's no looking back and we won't sleep tonight
We're living while we're young and this is worth the fight
Even if I lost it all
They can take my money
They can't take my words
They can have this fame
Hold me when I'm down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Shining like a chandelier
What's the word if it don't get heard
You can paint it anyway that you like
How can you get the picture if it come out blurred
What life taught me can't be unlearned
Another bridge can't be unburned
Can't wait till you get your firm
Your whole life need a renovation
They say life's about choices
In the face of defeat I declined
That's how you leave a magazine behind
Hold me when I'm down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Shining like a chandelier
Hold me when I'm down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Shining like a chandelier
The world don't stop so we don't quit
So live your life and do your thing
The rain of receipts are guarantees
When it's done there will be no sentence fee
Just a far away dream you've yet to reach
That's why you have to go all out for it
Make a something out of absolutely nothing
That's the definition of a survivor
Hold me when I'm down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Shining like a chandelier
Hold me when I'm down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Shining like a chandelier
So let me be like the trees
Where I can rest on my knees
To join the wind in the sky
Than be your greedy life
Hold me when I'm down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Shining like a chandelier
Just keep me shining like a chandelier
Just keep me shining like a chandelier
Hold me when I'm down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
But she the type of girl drive the whole hood crazy
Nowadays she's the life of the party
You got the whole world chasing you down
Y'all dressed in black black black
And tattoos down your back back back
I just wanna get to know ya
But you turn the other shoulder
Burning circles through membrane
Cause nowadays she's the life of the party
You got the whole world chasing you down
Y'all dressed in black black black
And tattoos down your back back back
I just wanna get to know ya
But you turn the other shoulder
I just wanna get to know ya
But you turn the other shoulder
Searching for an answer up high
Everything is crumbling around me
Feels like the ending of the times
See it's crazy when your friends turn to strangers
But then strangers running up like they know you
And the further away from the other day I go
I can feel the truth getting closer
If you in the fast lane or the slow one
And you might break down on the shoulder
I guess we all gotta exit to the next boulevard where the roads are
Searching for an answer up high
Everything appears to be fine
Everything is crumbling around me
Feels like the ending of the times
Gone off those Michael Myers
I can barely keep my lashes open
6 shots of the rum I'm done
Thinking about my partners death
Man how can that they not rearrange me
Searching for an answer up high
Simulated automated breakthroughs
Everything appears to be fine
They say you only get one life time
Then it's gone in a blink of an eye
Everything is crumbling around me
Feels like the ending of the times
I saw the lights dancing up so high
Escorted flooded off the sky
Pouring from the sands of time
I saw the lights dancing up so high
Escorted flooded off the sky
Pouring from the sands of time
Searching for an answer up high
Simulated automated breakthroughs
Everything appears to be fine
They say you only get one life time
Then it's gone in a blink of an eye
Everything is crumbling around me
Feels like the ending of the times
Everything I ever said
Everything that I have done
Building actions in my mind
Now that's all so yesterday
I'm just lighting up my fire
Tell the world I'm saying goodbye
I'm building castles in the sky
I'm building castles in the sky
Looking like a dimmer rapper
Feeling like a dusty wallet
The idiots guide to how to build an empire
I show you how to stunt show you how to pop
Gotta watch from my wrist and a watch for my paps
Now you can't act like you never heard of me
I'm in my castle and I'm never coming down
Everything I ever said
Everything that I have done
Building actions in my mind
Now that's all so yesterday
I'm just lighting up my fire
Tell the world I'm saying goodbye
I'm building castles in the sky
I'm building castles in the sky
Couldn't get her number couldn't even get her digit
Then I saw the light now my nights are explicit
Came a mighty long way
It started in my mind then it started shake
I still can't believe these events are taking place
Everything I ever said
Everything that I have done
Building actions in my mind
Now that's all so yesterday
I'm just lighting up my fire
Tell the world I'm saying goodbye
I'm building castles in the sky
I'm building castles in the sky
Cruising altitude with a foolish attitude
Everything I ever said
Everything that I have done
Building actions in my mind
Now that's all so yesterday
I'm just lighting up my fire
Tell the world I'm saying goodbye
I'm building castles in the sky
I'm building castles in the sky
Cruising altitude with a foolish attitude
Whatever happened to Bobby Ray
He used to be here for us
Then he got famous and left all of his fans in the dust
We never hear from you
You're constantly changing
And your relatives always miss you
And your mother misses you too
Since all of the fortune
You've been too busy recording
Now she feels unimportant
And your daddy's been going through it
Since he lost his mother
I never thought you would sell out
You're becoming so cocky
I asked you for a picture after your show
Ain't this the dude that said it ain't about the price tag
Now on your records all that you do is brag
I thought you were better than that dog
What happened to Cloud 9 and Generation lost
I heard you play this familiar melody
I heard you play this familiar melody
And everybody was on him
And the world fell in love
I guess he stopped giving a fuck
For all of us little people
They taste the fame and change like it's just automatic
There's more than what meets the eye
I swear on the Bible you were my idol
Just when I thought I give up on everything
I heard you play this familiar melody
I heard you play this familiar melody
I watched my whole life change in a couple of years
But if it wasn't meant to be this wouldn't be my career
But they never see the ropes and the pulleys and the gears
In the middle of this rap game on the battlefield
You never know who's gonna play you
We gave up all our belongings for this rap shit
I call it making a way for survival
Just when I thought I give up on everything
I dreamed about this familiar melody
I dreamed about this familiar melody
I dreamed about this familiar melody
I'm Hotter than a sauna
I make the whole club open like a soda
Nowadays everybody got something to say
Where the girls with a good head on your shoulder
When I'm on campus show me your diploma
It's me east side bachelor
So I laugh as I pass you up
When you running down the sideline
And you know don't even know what I got
And you don't even know when this dropped
And you don't even know what I'm about
You know you know you know it won't stop
You talking about money than you calling my name
You talking about flipping money than you talking my game
You talk about small money than you talking it lame
5.0 yeah bag is little
Guess whose in the middle
If it don't come fully equipped then don't get it
The seats ain't leather my man then don't sit it
If you ain't got no rubbers on hand then don't hit it
I collect money like child support
I like soccer moms I'm on the soccer team
From the block to the board room
We can do it in the streets or in the court room
I put a hoop in the house that's a court room
And you know don't even know what I got
And you don't even know when this dropped
And you don't even know what I'm about
You know you know you know it won't stop
Down like that whenever we creep up
And we slide to the back and we stay linked up
Why the hell they hating on us
I'm living my dream don't wake me up
Anybody trying to get up on my level better have to feel misfortune
I will never ever ever have a shortage
18 damn months been touring
But I always knew there'd be bitterness
Life can be ridiculous
So I ball like this on these hypocrites
And you know don't even know what I got
And you don't even know when this dropped
And you don't even know what I'm about
Back it up and drop it
Put it in my lap girl
I had a taste and I can't do without it
I just wanna see you drop it
Now scrub the floor like comet bitch
Girl I don't doubt it
Don't stop drop it like a hydraulic
Looking like a goddess girl
Show me what your body can do
Show me what your body can do
I wanna see your body
Like a green light don't stop it
Back it up break it off real proper
And you know I'm worldwide like your wireless provider
She picture perfect where is a photographer
Don't put your feet on my seat these are ostriches
Ease up I got this shit
But I just wanna see you drop it
Now scrub the floor like comet bitch
Girl I don't doubt it
Don't stop drop it like a hydraulic
Show me what your body can do
Show me what your body can do
I wanna see your body
Show me what your body can do
I wanna see your body
Show me what your body can do
I wanna see your body
Body stay in motion she deserve a trophy
Booty so devoted she deserve a promotion
Pull up to the house she bring it out like sunny
Please be aware there's a monster amongst us
Girl I don't doubt it
Don't stop drop it like a hydraulic
Show me what your body can do
Show me what your body can do
I wanna see your body
Show me what your body can do
I wanna see your body
Show me what your body can do
I wanna see your body
It's been a long time coming
And the clock says a quarter to 4
I'm feeling like it's now or never
And your bodies telling me it's a go
On a late night weekend showcase event
Kind of liked you at first but I noticed your friend
So I got my folks to approach both of them
And they both came over and we poured up some hen
Cause you don't have to speak when you know
It's about that time we should go
So allow me to flow as I propose a toast
To the good life on a good night we go
Grab a bottle and go tell her hold on
Yes a beautiful night
But as soon as you went to the room I guess you froze
It's been a long time coming
And the clock says a quarter to 4
I'm feeling like it's now or never
And your bodies telling me it's a go
It's the end of the week but the first of the month
When the moon gets full but the night is still young
With a crowd like this you don't know where you'll end up
And I didn't know what you were thinking
But your eyes said enough
And everything we felt was obvious lust
Which I thought was kinda cool I ain't gonna bluff
But look at the clock
No need to be in a rush
But later you can hit me up so you hit me up
Shoes at the door smoke in the air temperatures up
But I guess when the lights went out it froze you up
It's been a long time coming
And the clock says a quarter to 4
I'm feeling like it's now or never
And your bodies telling me it's a go
This is how my day go
Got a tour bus with a room in it
Yes I put it over a time to mix it
That's school and put the beat it at the school detention
Got me Captain Hook man after low murder make me a burger
I'm so further like the place that you ain't heard of pound worker
See I get out hand to my building I am so ambitious
So when I walk around that's fitness I pass fur when I visit
Overseas ball no pivot you talk about it and I love it
Since day one you heard me
From the underground to the surface
With a booty so big you can probably Google Earth it
Try to make some revenue
Standing five foot five
Looking straight incredible
But the guys will be lying
Really they just scared of you
So girl I am telling you
Well give it to me right now
I could use your soul
And we can do it right now
Like we are all alone
And now you wait to do
The things we're made to do
What we're made to do we ain't ashamed
So girl give it to me right now
You're just like a pro
You know I am watching whenever you are on clock
I hope you'll never take a break I hope you won't stop
Every single time you break it down you get them
Every time you dress you bless them
You fresh to death them
I guess I have to resurrect them think of all your killing
Cooler than a cucumber two thumbs up
With the high heels and your suit on yes you do you know
You're so professional
Try to make some revenue
Standing five for five
Looking straight incredible
But the guys will be lying
Really they just scared of you
But girl I am telling you
Well give it to me right now
I could use your soul
And we can do it right now
Like we are all alone
And now you wait to do the things we're made to do
What we're made to do we ain't ashamed
So girl give it to me right now
You're just like a pro
You're doing it doing it
You know just what to do with that thing
You know just what to do with it do with it
You know just what to do with it that thing
I like the way you move it move it
I like the way you move it with that thing
I like the way you move it move it
You're just like a pro
I can tell by the way you type
I can tell by the way you neatly stack them papers across that desk
If you ever get a guy like me
Light on now bring your waist to the edge of the bed
That is it you know what I like
A business woman by day
Roxy Reynolds by night
But you're so professional
Try to make some revenue
Standing five for five
Looking straight incredible
But the guys will be lying
Really they just scared of you
That's why I am telling
Well give it to me right now
I could use your soul
And we can do it right now
Like we are all alone
And now you wait to do
The things we're made to do
What we're made to do we ain't ashamed
So girl give it to me right now
You're just like a pro
I like the way you move it with that thing
I like the way you move it move it
I like the way you move it with that thing
Well give it to me right now
I could use your soul
And we can do it right now
Like we are all alone
And now you wait to do
The things we're made to do
What we're made to do we ain't ashamed
So girl give it to me right now
I want everything I see
I wanna go in every mall in every state in every country and buy shit
That's what the fuck we're here for
It's just so many woman
It's just so many chains
It's just so many watches
It's just too many things
It's just so many trips
It's just so many bottles
It's just too many whips
It's just too many models
I'd rather have an em
If hundreds ain't in them
You talking about like it ain't about the money
A house on the hill by the lake
But my rent is due on today
A Better life is what we're after
Because every dream I gotta capture
I always knew that I would blow up one day
Like a nuclear reactor
From the cradle to a label
Could've been in jail
Could have been fatal
Must have had an angel
It's funny how I'm always on the screen
But as a teen I never had cable
I took a fantasy and made it exist
No one ever handed a shit
We took what we had and made it this shit
That's just from the dust to the luxury
Terry Urban. The Commissioner. One two.
The only thing that I give is the words on this beats
And it's easy to see that I encourage the streets
I'm in the game permanently
The O the B and all the periods in between
Man I do this shit here for the city I'm from
Plus by thus far I'm as real as they come
So if you wanna stop me best pick up a gun
Well all that I've have got to give
How how how how how how how how how
How how how how how how how how how
So all that I have got to give
How how how how how how how how how
How how how how how how how how how
Y'all Earthlings with my super duper button
And I got government transmitters in my head
So I'm paranoid I got bullets in my bed
Well all that I've have got to give
How how how how how how how how how
How how how how how how how how how
So all that I have got to give
How how how how how how how how how
How how how how how how how how how
You don't know who you fucking with
This the type of talk that'll probably piss off my publicist
The type of talk that'll probably get me in trouble with the law
Or make the government come after me in public
They'll aim at everyone going against this shit
It's like nobody else complains
A 100 thousand miles an hour when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
A 100 thousand miles an hour when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
Is our views on reality kinda distorted
I still fall weak for a booty that's proportionate
But still I'm wondering what family was present when history was recorded
A 100 thousand miles an hour when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
A 100 thousand miles an hour when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
They passing laws where they can run up in your own home
If you won't take the microchip then you can't make no dollars
Don't let these fuckers rob us for our freedom and your rights
A 100 thousand miles an hour when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
A 100 thousand miles an hour when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
I'm too greedy with two ladies
Hustle Gang ain't that the squad
I just give her major pressure while she gave me major woo
All I heard is that boy a pop
All I heard is that boy a not
Just turned my crib to the hookah spot
Ham squad Hustle Gang
That's that underground luxury
I don't mess with them fake type
This dick right here is cleaner than a hypochondriac
She told me she wish she knew me sooner
Then I'm a do whatever I want
I said my chain so bright I'm a vacation in it
I got a hundred fifty racks just to show up
She said her booty from the motherland
Bow down to the wood like a shrine
That's the only time you'll be less than a dime
I wanna put it on your mind when I see you grind
Private jet I flew that
It sounds crazy but it ain't nothing it
She a freak but I already knew it
She looked at me and said I'm yo biggest fan
I told her if it's real then tattoo it
Giving that good and like the middle wafers
Someone said my love you're called a label
You gotta block that shit fool
I ain't even got no genre
Cause see this is not necessarily based on dexterity
I'm good as I'll ever be
Why do we all want all the things that we can't have at all
Just a little bit further till I arrive
Or is it just a mirage fooling my mind
Speeding through life just to end up running back to the start
Just a little bit further till I arrive
Or is it just a mirage fooling my mind
Born under the view of the eye
Fed food to consume and influence the mind
Sacrificial executions disguised as
Asking these questions I lose track of time
Just a little bit further till I arrive
Or is it just a mirage fooling my mind
If you knew better you'd do better
Could be my body on yo body ho
Hit you from the back like a 4 by 4
Smack on that ass like I know that ho
This everything that you dreamed of
This everything that you need
And you about to lose the dang girl
I pull up then I start to party
I'm yo main bitch top priority
Yeah bust it open for me
This everything that you dreamed of
Till ya find out who I was
If anybody else got something to say
I swear to God I'm always on a hater's mind
I swear I'm always on a hater's mind
I swear I'm always on a hater's mind
They don't understand
I do this for the days
When I had just enough to get by
Now I got more than enough to get by
But I got more than enough on my mind
Just lost a loved one the other night
Just got home and another one died
I don't even have the tears to cry
Ain't no one left for me to call
Ain't no more numbers on my line
Tell me how high must I climb
But I don't really have the time
I don't really have the time
If anybody else got something to say
I swear to God I'm always on a hater's mind
I swear I'm always on a hater's mind
I swear I'm always on a hater's mind
If anybody else got something to say
I swear to God I'm always on a hater's mind
I swear I'm always on a hater's mind
I swear I'm always on a hater's mind
I make that pussy whistle like the Old Spice man
She started talking but I really couldn't hear
Until she started dancing like she do it in the mirror
Like she do it in the mirror
All I want you to do is just drop that ass down
Dead ass rapper should have came with a cemetery
So I closed the curtains on the 62
To do a threesome you gotta intervene
She started talking but I really couldn't hear
Until she started dancing like she do it in the mirror
Like she do it in the mirror
She do it like she do it in the mirror
I'm looking for the baddest one here
I could take a step back and sip my cognac there
She started talking but I really couldn't hear
Until she started dancing like she do it in the mirror
Seems like your heart stops working
The minute they close the curtain
And take off your mask
And take off your costume
And if anyone asks you're taking a small break
But everyone knows what you're doing
Seems like the bus moves slower
Just cause you got somewhere to go
So you take a few pills in Beverly Hills
But if anyone asks you've got a prescription
Who do you think that you're fooling
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
You race to the bottom of every single bottle
As if there was someone or something to find
You're struggling in your mind
And you tell yourself lie after lie
Till you get to the point where it's no longer private
That people that you work with noticed the signs
When you walk in the room
It gets noticeably quiet
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
Smashed too many freaks
Had too much to drop me
Had too much to drink
With a woman up under me
Is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it
And the parties with beautiful women
I spend so much time as an underground artist
But that what you'd judge I become
The path with the greatest resistance
That's how the tables can turn when they pivot
And change you perspective and flip your entire position
My whole life I've been dying to wish and to live and experience
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
Oh cranberry moonwalk
Bang that bitch and her baby make up
She was hanging so tight I had to amputate her like uh
And I swear this freak bitch ride my wave so long
She know how to surf now
Oh cranberry moonwalk
I got my own lane but I ain't got no genre
Go and my weed hydroponic
Anything you done did
Oh cranberry moonwalk
When they see that work
When they see that work
Oh cranberry moonwalk
I guess I bit off more than I could chew
Had it all and never knew
Nobody told me money don't make you rich
Nobody told me you can lose when you win
Who knew that this much success will make it so hard
But that's to accept the fact that I can't go back where I left
You know money don't buy you no respect
And smash grills I could never smash
And live fantasies that'll never last
I guess I bit off more than I could chew
Had it all and never knew
Nobody told me money don't make you rich
Nobody told me you can lose when you win
I ran away from home just to try to make a million
And when you get a million it's a different type of feeling
When you look around and what you really need is missing
And can't find a doctor to fill out the prescription
Or diagnose the illness
And I find that ironic
How I can buy anything that I ever wanted
But I really had it all when I ain't have nothing
I guess I'd illustrate it if it's good but however
I couldn't find the words to say it better
But all that glitters with gold is not treasure
I work even better when I'm under pressure
They say money don't make you rich
Nobody told me money don't make you rich
Nobody told me you can lose when you win
I guess I bit off more than I could chew
Had it all and never knew
Nothing is forever easy
Nothing is forever easy
Nothing is forever easy
Started with my pockets slim
Now I got a lot of M's
They see me and they know it's him
Oh they oh they know it's him
I'm so high I don't even get high no more
I'm so fly I don't even let it down no more
I'm so out there I'm going up no more
We ain't the same and I don't know why
Nothing is forever easy
Nothing is forever easy
Nothing is forever easy
But at least I know I'm gonna learn
And I know I know I got my work
We ain't the same and I don't know why
Nothing is forever easy
Nothing is forever easy
Nothing is forever easy
But when this shit jump off they ain't cares no more
I'm a white French like east side bro
And all my black friends you know them
You can call me Christmas dad
And if yo freak wanna try to jump down
We ain't the same and I don't know why
Nothing is forever easy
Nothing is forever easy
Nothing is forever easy

From these psychedelic trees and I think it's rubbing off on me
From these psychedelic trees and I think it's rubbing off on me
Looking through my contacts ain't no one to call
Television screens and news reports just serve as a distraction
Couldn't help but stomach what I saw but still my conscious was upset
Some thoughts is trapped inside my head so I roll a blunt to ease my stress
Over all this shit that wouldn't matter if we knew what was ahead
From these psychedelic trees and I think it's rubbing off on me
From these psychedelic trees and I think it's rubbing off on me
Born prodigy no apologies fuck a policy
Fuck around and make a monster out of me
Run to your momma but it's late and your momma gotta sleep
I apologize for the violence
I swear I'm killing every single thing I touch
Let's have a moment of silence
For anyone that thinks that I could give two fucks
I apologize for the violence
I apologize for the violence
In this game friendships don't last long
It that's about as long as a hit song
So I keep a full clip full of hit songs
So when I get to busting it's a shit storm
Roll the drum till I get it out my system
When you hot imitators try to mimic you
If you was that important then I'd remember you
Well I get I'm too in the mix
Next known flow I'm on some Jupiter shit
Hundred deep on some hooligan shit
Killing everything I see on some funeral shit
I apologize for the violence
I swear I'm killing every single thing I touch
Let's have a moment of silence
For anyone that thinks I could give two fucks
I apologize for the violence

She didn't like Jane Plain
She was smiling to hide Jane's pain
But there was something about Plain Jane
Yes there was something about her.
She couldn't find her purpose
So she couldn't see her worth
Yes there was something about her
So you go and do the doctor thing and the doctor asks what you want to change
She couldn't find her purpose
So she couldn't see her worth
Yes there was something about her
As she lives in the souls of those
Who can't escape being vain
And she looks in the mirror in pain
And she feels ashamed
So wrapped up in the pain
She even hates her name
And she won't entertain the sunshine
And she sick of playing all the games
There's something about Plain Jane
She didn't like Jane Plain
She was smiling to hide Jane's pain
But there was something about Plain Jane
Yes there was something about Plain Jane
My baby's got an hourglass
Wanna know wanna know what time it is
Turn it over like an hourglass
Know they got me when you clock in
Put it on me like sand through an hourglass
Ain't nothing wrong with a little temptation
My baby's got an hourglass
Wanna know wanna know what time it is
Turn it over like an hourglass
Know they got me when you clock in
Ain't nothing wrong with a little temptation
My baby's got an hourglass
Wanna know wanna know what time it is
Turn it over like an hourglass
Know they got me when you clock in
I'm in this apartment that I don't want no one to know
Dressed up for stages and faces in similar clothes
And always ascending drifting into the unknown
I wonder if we are living a show so tell me I gotta know
If I were to be honest and bold would I be a hero
If were to bleed my blood would flow a violet Vibrato
Communication is so amazing when shown
As we awaken and all the pages unfold
I wonder if we are living a show so tell me I gotta know
If I were to be honest and bold would I be a hero
If were to bleed my blood would flow a violet Vibrato
I wonder if we are living a show so tell me I gotta know
If I were to be honest and bold would I be a hero
If were to bleed my blood would flow a violet Vibrato
So that's why making money makes the most sense get your revenue
So all I do is work and get high so excuse me for my
So that's why making money makes the most sense get your revenue
So all I do is work and get high so excuse me for my
Money always take a good thing and complicate shit
How you stop yourself from a mistake before you make it
If you never seen a problem can't solve for the equation
Even a fuck you takes up too much time and energy to say it
And if time is money I won't mind in the AM
Don't wake me in the AM unless you talking 8 M's
You was blind till now
But soon as the shine wears off they're nowhere to be found
So that's why making money makes the most sense get your revenue
So all I do is work and get high so excuse me for my
Forgive me if I'm too honest girl that booty humongous baby you must do lunges
She love the whole crew so she paid the crew homage
Get out your seat hit the floor put your groove on it girl
And put it down we go see
No strings attached but you tongue tied
She gonna get deep like the dumb kind
Heat it up till you blush
Feel the rush feel the rush
I guess I take the fault for what my occupation is
It cost bread to join the game but even more to escape the shit
I see calculated cowards taking calculated risks
But it's nothing they can tell me
The line between the good and bad is paper thin
Said I love this life
Said I love this life
And you could have it all and feel you never need nothing
But he who loves nothing will never have nothing at all
And you could be a superstar
But still feel like an outlaw
And never need nothing at all
But still have an empty heart
Our living condition was not ideal but some kinda way we learned
That growing up poor don't make you real
All they can do is call us thugs till they need they problem solve
Need someone to run they club
He who doesn't love what he has will never have enough
And you could have it all and feel you never need nothing
But he who loves nothing will never have nothing at all
And you could be a superstar
But still feel like an outlaw
And never need nothing at all
He even wears the fashion
Shut us up to make him pop commercials smashes
That's why people don't take you seriously
We don't wanna hear your conspiracies
And that's why we don't come to your after parties
A sell out surrounded by wealth
You should have been one of the greats
Now you just sound like everyone else
Like I ain't even know how the flow supposed to go
Like I ain't even know how the show supposed to flow
Like I ain't even know how the beat supposed to sound
Like I ain't even know where the notes supposed to go
Like I ain't even know how my soul's supposed to feel
But you'll never understand the way that I think
I feel like I don't belong
I stepped into the Hall of Fame and put my frame on the wall
I'm like a Michelangelo painting that hangs in the vault
Kill everything I see and leave behind a mountain of chalk
Wanna cut me out the picture get some bigger scissors
I feel like I don't belong
I feel like I don't belong
Nice than a motherfucker
Nice than a motherfucker
Bright than a motherfucker
Hype than a motherfucker
Ice cube on the pinkie and the middle finger
You was just on my dick just 5 yesterdays
I guess I got a short attention span
Nice than a motherfucker
Nice than a motherfucker
Bright than a motherfucker
Hype than a motherfucker
Ice cube on the pinkie and the middle finger
Why do yes man's start off ever sentence
I can no longer be held accountable
Call it what you want
But it ain't an anthem till the strippers moving
I guess I got a short attention span
I tried to take the high road
I tried to take the high road
But now another life's gone
To turn the other cheek
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
Except for the slavery and the genocide
When we kill all the native and steal their tribes
And it's time we denied women's rights
Like when they brought crack cocaine to the hood
Like when they brought heroin to the states
Equality don't have a twitter account
The last words that a man should ever hear
I think about packing my bags and leaving this country for good
Guess it's my fault for being black
A country built on my people's backs
For the end of segregation
All we got is a month and a television station
All they teach is slavery and we celebrate it
They turn the cheek if we should perish
But just remember you can't spell America without Eric
I tried to take the high road
I tried to take the high road
But now another life's gone
To turn the other cheek
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
By any means necessary
Lately two many mommas out here bearing babies
Scared of the law when they head outdoors
But for now I'm like Malcolm out the window it's simple altercation
Gentrify like fuck wherever you go
Prison walls nowadays big biz
Give us dope then lock us up to get riches
Then send us out to a job we can't get
The president don't give a fuck about us
The government don't give a fuck either
I just wanna say my piece
I just want that 40 acres and mule
Another promise didn't fall through
Just a whole lot of propaganda and lying to me and you
I tried to take the high road
I tried to take the high road
I tried to take the high road
But now another life's gone
To turn the other cheek
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
I ain't been this fucked up in a while
Don't know how I made it to the house
Woke up with two bitches in my house
Now she running in and out of shows
The fountain of youth I think I done found it
She know the promoters and all the bouncers
And then the next thing
I woke up in the west wing
Now she running in and out of shows
She wanting me to hit it for a hour
Get down for the get down
I can be your ring tone
It don't really get on
Family feud with Steve Harvey
What you want me to pretend
Twist every chance I get
But every day I contradict
Wonder why they haven't heard an album from me
Now how does it throttle
The truth is a hard pill to swallow
Landing footage from Apollo look like amateur night down at the Apollo and they say in space
Off the wall like Peter Parker
Here let's get to squeezing on you like some squeegee water
Keep the garter bitch
Pick me up before six
Gutter bitch with another bitch
Eating pussy with a side of wine
When she in a penthouse with a tight view
Pick me up before six
Gutter bitch with another bitch
Pick me up before six
Gutter bitch with another bitch
Pick me up before six
Gutter bitch with another bitch
This is your mind on drugs
It means I'm high as fuck
They describe teens all type of stuff
Even the side effects got side effects
As if you ain't already depressed enough
Not even for pharmacy use
And turn up a pot of soup
Don't know what a doctor would do
Don't need no alternative route
All about the rumors and the groupie tells
A new one gets reintroduced
But weed doesn't kill
The war that's on drugs actually creates all the violence
And problems we see on the news
Well you can fuck that up here
And that shit fucked my whole life up
I got a new confession
I battle with depression
I guess I feel neglected
Now I'm just fucking reckless
I canceled all my shows
I burned all my clothes
I'm going out my mind
I just need to be alone
It just rolls and it rolls
I'm sick of your suggestions
I hate the stupid questions
I hate to be corrected
They say I need a ration
Then you in the wrong profession
I cut off all my hoes
When you going through some shit
You just hope nobody knows
It just rolls and it rolls
It just rolls and it rolls
I know what you're waiting for
That you really think you deserve it
I know how you want this to go
I know how you want me to flow
You want to even this go
You want me to upload a post
Old bitches always be down for a setup but that's what my shooters is for
Bitches be so quick to side with a bitch like they never heard rumors before
From the hood but not a hoodlum
I know what you're waiting for
That you really think you deserve it
Couldn't leave well enough alone
I know what you're waiting for
That you really think you deserve it
They tell me that I play a lot
But I don't think that they play enough
I don't know if I'm right or not
I paint the town and every city I stay
ADD or you just never really learn how to play
They tell me that I play a lot
But I don't think that they play enough
I don't know if I'm right or not
We become the people that hurt us the most
I became everything I used to criticize
We just to ride back at different time
Now I'm gonna go to the place where I know I've been free.
If you just gave me one more chance I might have gotten rid of amnesia.
Next time leave when you can instead of just staring at me like that that
If you get sick no need for amnesia.
Leave me like this even though you know it's wrong.
I'm sick and tired of friends with benefits
Been through too many goodbyes
And I can't say that I been so innocent
But it seems like whenever I get closer
And just when I thought my chances were over
I stared my future in the face
I looked an angel in the eye
And since then I've been paralyzed
Something told me she'd be mine
And I knew it before she said hi
And I knew it before she said hi
I made a lot of broken promises
I had no respect for words
And I thought that I'd gotten all that I'm against
She whispers to me and it pulls me closer
And now I feel like all my pain is over
I stared my future in the face
I looked an angel in the eye
And since then I've been paralyzed
Something told me she'd be mine
And I knew it before she said hi
And I knew it before she said hi
Until both her eyes connected like a metro
And so we started to kick it like a pedal
And as the story goes
I started doing shows
So I've been with the flow
And then I called your phone
I looked an angel in the eye
And since then I've been paralyzed
Something told me she'd be mine
And I knew it before she said hi
Well as this cold world
Turns round and round
If I could take it away
The pain I feel won't nobody know
And every time I wake up I wanna go home
But sing a song for you
That's why I'll never let you go
They say I lost my mind
But I did that so long ago
So when I close my eyes
But at night these angels be singing to me
So as I lay awake at night
I drift away into the sky
And that's where I reside
So pray that I'll be just fine
I see you when it's time
I'll see you when it's time
Well as this cold world
Turns round and round
If I could take it away
The pain I feel won't nobody know
And every time I wake up I wanna go home
But sing a song for you
That's why I'll never let you go
They say I lost my mind
But I did that so long ago
So when I close my eyes
And so I'm thinking to myself girl I need you
There ain't a price that you could pay to make me leave you
I get you anything and everything to please you
I'm standing outside of your window just to see you
I say I love you once
I say I love you twice
To show you how I feel
Why do you Build me up
You know that I have from the start
Buttercup don't break my heart
Like that time you through that brick through my window
You said you can't take it no more
But you didn't walk out of that door
You say that you change
But we fussing and fighting where ever we go
All out in public every body watching like a reality show
But it don't matter no more
I say I love you once
I say I love you twice
To show you how I feel
Why do you build me up
You know that I have from the start
Buttercup don't break my heart
Why do you build me up
You know that I have from the start
Buttercup don't break my heart
When I climb into my memory's
What else is there to say
I know you feel me especially when you wake up every day
Even though you swear you never ever ever changed her
So without further a due
And elevate into the blue
You have just witnessed world history being made
I say I am the champion
I say I am the champion
Lights and cameras on
What a spectacular form
But I'm just as human as you
And they telling me I have so much dough
I won't know what to do with it
I say I am the champion
I look in the mirror and laugh
Like look at what I've become
I'm still my mother's son
And I'm low key when I'm out now
Hell no fame ain't fun
But I stay live like NBA on yo play station
And critics say that I imitate but I really can't
Please allow me to demonstrate
But no matter what they say
I stay charged up like a triple A
Lights cameras action
I say I am the champion
I say I am the champion
It seems like the crowd is pandemonium
And it seems like they're returning something
I say I am the champion
The neural path I've traveled has immediate reaction
A fraction or a fragment of me actually is present
Freedom isn't found inside a visa or a crown
Mortals are immortal when their soul has been imported
This is the warmest moment of a poet turned heroic
Tie the game like a shot from outside when it's 95 to 98
So I can't spell and can't mail it out
And went and took all the bitches of the athletes
And a new fitted cap that I ain't wore out yet
On my last trip to Sydney in the Sheraton lobby
And pull a bottle out that cabinet while that kitchen's warm
I come from the school of hard knocks and overachievers
To be the voice of the people and go against all this evil
Where people say it doesn't matter to be much
I just want to say I remember when
Or things could get heated and you'll get ferociously beat
And that's gonna make me dance
And that's gonna make me dance
And that's gonna make me dance
And that's gonna make me dance
On the street don't mean a thing.
And that's gonna make me dance
And that's gonna make me dance
And that's gonna make me dance
And that's gonna make me dance
Make it rain trick make it make it rain trick
Make it rain trick make it make it rain trick
Make it rain trick make it make it rain trick
Make it rain trick make it make it rain trick
Make it rain trick make it make it rain trick
And that's gonna make me dance
And that's gonna make me dance
And that's gonna make me dance
And that's gonna make me dance
Make it rain trick make it make it rain trick
Make it rain trick make it make it rain trick
Make it rain trick make it make it rain trick
Make it rain trick make it make it rain trick
Still gave it up when it's a few of us
She let me finger fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
Just penetrating that throat dog
She choke on it like Smoke Dog
In a dice game I go see her
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
Pay the bill on my beeper
And I know what time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
I mean damn these hoes get paid
Even if I know it ain't real love
When the trap hot and police ride
And my four pounds till it goes down
I won't say her name because she married now
When the lights go out and I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head oh
All of the things that I did back then
Oh when I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had oh
All of the things that I did back then
She would always turn heads when she'd fall through
She would always make moves how a boss do
When we kick it she roll up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watching just to see if the police coming
Right around the time that I first got signed
I was going back and forth with these flights
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
She'd go through my phone and we'd fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasn't really much more that we could do
Wasn't really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
And my common sense neglected
And two months later next thing I know
And you can almost bet she kept it
That's the reason why you left me
When the lights go out and I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head oh
All of the things that I did back then
Oh when I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had oh
All of the things that I did back then
Jay 3-0-5 had gave me high five
When I said I'm in hot pursuit
You said I won't ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise
But no freestyle I never do
To make it rain on you like about to break a levee
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer
But I ain't got the time or the patience
Fuck you and Mitt Romney
I'm grown now I'm on my own now
And your 3 kids and 3 baby daddies
When the lights go out and I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head oh
All of the things that I did back then
Oh when I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had oh
I'm way too high for you to look at
I'm guessing they was hoping for some different results
So I think it's time for these haters to get off my dick
And I ain't talking congressmen and I ain't talking politics
Even if you're somebody else's
If you got the wrong impression
Cause anything is better than nothing at all
I just wanna show you a table for two
All you did was go on a date with a dude
Has he ever wrote a hit or some poet shit
Even if you're somebody else's
If you got the wrong impression
When they see us together
I wonder if you're matching your bras with them panties
I hit the mall to do damage
They way she hit the high notes
It's marble not granite
From the counter to the shower
So go on get your body wet
We ain't made it to the lobby yet
Put you on game girl so it's obvious
I give you the world if you ain't got it yet
Even if you're somebody else's
If you got the wrong impression
You might be with someone else
But I still see that you fiend a be with a G like me
You never need no one else
Even if you're somebody else's
If you got the wrong impression
Bathing ape on my back
Even though I'm looking from the front
I can still see that back
Beat the beat up like I'm Roy in that ring
Six bottles I just copped
That's more bad bitches I'm getting
And go past what they came here for
Just in case I don't make it
One of these chicks is taking me home
One of these chicks is taking me home
That little red bone said she's taking me home
Fine ass friend said she coming along
Before I gotta roll out all I do is turn up
So that they know that I'm ready
Just in case I don't make it
One of these chicks is taking me home
One of these chicks is taking me home
Smell it fore I light it
So you know my weed good
Fly like a pilot from the same time it should
Just make one thing understood
You nothing without paper like books
Just in case I don't make it
One of these chicks is taking me home
One of these chicks is taking me home
Nu ah ah ah ah ah numb
Welcome to Atlanta where the big boys roam
Coming live from the dome gotta be a bees home
Practicing in a new hobby and the eagles
Birds of prey hovering above
But Maddy ice is ready to rip it out of his ...
Michael Turner is likely to earn him a couple of jaws
But the packers a whole new encore
But accordingly to charts ... that will never happen
Battling for 13 years and still in fashion
If you loose you're no longer remembered
It's a game of vengeance so we've even a little brain
Can be the difference between the losers and all the great tools really who's silly and who's fake
I'm higher than a baby on a seesaw with Precious
Behind my zipper where her lipstick go
The only thing I hate to see is hate
What an incredible place to be
Ain't no other place I'd rather be
Away from the lowlifes surrounded by money
Put it down for the team
What an incredible place to be
The last men standing when the shit get real
When the rest up we stepped up like a 6 inch heel
I'm getting used to how this rich shit feel
She might even put them on the glass if we mix a lot
Get her nice and buzzed
What an incredible place to be
Ain't no other place I'd rather be
Away from the lowlifes surrounded by money
Put it down for the team
What an incredible place to be
What an incredible place to be
Ain't no other place I'd rather be
Away from the lowlifes surrounded by money
Put it down for the team
What an incredible place to be
What an incredible place to be
Ain't no other place I'd rather be
Away from the lowlifes surrounded by money
Put it down for the team
Fresh to death like I'm dressed for a eulogy
I'll probably need to after school tutor it
Sideline haters need to chill where the cooler is
Still I'm chill blunt wider than a coffee cup
So far away there ain't no signal on my phone
Everybody knows who you are
Who would've thought I would've took it this far
Standing on top of Church's Chicken playing guitar
When I was younger space shuttle got hung in front of everyone
Now stumble and they will know I put on my pants
It also says I play the violin and that ain't true but
You give me six strings and a pick
And I encourage any child to pick up some instrument
You will finally realize that they meant you no harm
They be saying I sound like I'm out of tune
I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America
Trying to get some money put your motherfucking hands high
Look at all this money fallen
I throw money in the air
Bitch I go hard I put my all in
If my phone ring that's money calling
Smell my weed it come from Cali
All my rings are filled with diamonds
Now they say that he got game I make it rain like Jesus Christ
Everybody wants to get paid
Counting so much money our figures numb
That's why every night we wanna be in the club
Money fallen from the sky sky
Trying to get some money put your motherfucking hands high
Money fallen from the sky sky
Trying to get some money put your motherfucking hands high
Ain't in this for profit
My lyrics may seem misguided to the petite and simple minded
But I'm so out this world
When it come to this cash man
I ain't use no discretion
Just part of me gotta chase em
My blatant void of concern to prepare for an obligation
And I always had ambition
I was on the hustle since I was this big
Trying to get some money put your motherfucking hands high
Trying to get some money put your motherfucking hands high
There's money to make
Where the laws are made
Where crime still pays
There's money to make
Trying to get some money put your motherfucking hands high
I wonder how they sleep at night.
Acting so damn mysterious
You got your shades on your eyes
And your heels so high
That you can't even have a good
Well pay them with love tonight...
Forget about the Price Tag.
Forget about the Price Tag.
When music made us all UNITED
Money can't buy us happiness.
If we all slow down and enjoy right now
Well pay them with love tonight...
Forget about the Price Tags
Forget about the Price Tag.
Forget about the Price
Wanna make the world change
We just wanna make the world change
Forget about the Price Tag
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took i
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the and of the almighty.
We forward in this generation
Wont you help to sing
None but ourselves can free our minds.
Cause none of them can stop the time.
Wont you help to sing
None but ourselves can free our mind.
Wont you help to sing
She's ahead of the class for she got a stupid booty
Back it up and drop it down
Back it up and drop it down
Make that thing clap clap
Drop it out and back it down
She can't ride it with the skirt on
That booty dumb that ass ain't got no sense aye
But still its smart enough to pay the rent aye
Might take a picture put it up on display
I need a smart girl with a dumb booty
Could have been on clueless
That thing dropped out of high school
That thing got a low IQ
Go on head throw that fanny back
Show me where you tatted at
And I case you forgot let me remind you
She danced through the house all by herself
I'm cash's out like I'm cash out
Everybody know me I'm Tex James
Like a smart girl with a dumb booty
Ass so big don't make no sense
Last time he seen a brick
What the fuck he rapping about
All we do is pour it up
And all we do is light it up
All we do is pour it up
And all we do is light it up
He don't know me do he
Thought you knew this
All we do is pour it up
And all we do is light it up
I take my city everywhere that I go.
So when you see me you then already know.
Throwing them things in a octagon.
So throw some cheese up.
All my east sider riders throw them E's up.
I take my city everywhere that I go.
So when you see me you then already know.
East sider long beach.
This is how I view success.
I take my city everywhere that I go.
So when you see me you then already know.
Places that I've been to.
I take my city everywhere that I go.
So when you see me you then already know.
They even talk like us
But they are not like us
They wear the disguise
Look into the mind's eye
There's nowhere to hide
Frosting covered lies
They even talk like us
But they are not like us
They wear the disguise
Look into the mind's eye
There's nowhere to hide
My juveniles wild to stay out past their curfew
A build upon life and drink beers like their pops do
Don't expose the joint without intentional reason
Faced you with the flight of a butter fly wing
Might wobble or fall down inside the squabble
Probably in metropolis
So you can call this monopoly
Groupies try to body me
But I'm in a different planet so excuse my astrology
For dropping all these prophecies
Guess I'm just atomically built the way that I bomb on the beat
I don't need no optometry
I do this in a blindfold
Baby whether you high or low
You got to tip on the tightrope
Now let me see you do the tightrope
Welcome to the meeting of the minds
That be thinking all the time
Bout defeating all the blind
I prefer to figure eight
Till the candles on my mantle stop
And it's getting programming on
Every single channel watched
Televised revolutionaries on the chapel top
Down in Babylonian accounting
Medieval mathematics keep us average in amounting
I dropped out of their math class.
Now my tightrope is like a sidewalk
Baby whether you high or low
You got to tip on the tightrope
Now let me see you do the
I can rhyme with the fellas
I am unpredictable like the weather
I stay floated like a feather
Jump on a elevator baby we on then ext level
Album just dropped and I've been on
Well they ain't seem to mind the last 3 times I posed in vogue
And then some people get low
So my people could know
Like I'm Dominique Dawes
Baby whether you high or low
You got to tip on the tightrope
Now let me see you do the
Baby baby baby whether you high
Baby whether you high or low
You got to tip on the tightrope
Now let me see you do the
I don't know why she's with me
I only brought her trouble since the day she met me
I would have walked away
But now I've broken away
Somehow instead she forgave me
She said a woman's got to do what she's got to do
Even if it means she denied herself the truth
You've fallen in love in the worst way
And if you don't go now then you'll stay
Go now before it's too late
Go now before it's too late
She's standing in the heart of darkness
Saying I know you got a soul even though you're heartless
To find something this safe
Instead of walking with me she should have walked away
She finds color in the darkest places
She finds beauty in the saddest of faces
For such a groovy and headstrong city girl
Could've had the world but she's fallen in love in the worst way
And if you don't go now then you'll stay
Go now before it's too late
Go now before it's too late
I don't know why she's with me
I only brought her trouble since the day she met me
I would have walked away
But you've fallen in love in the worst way
And if you don't go now then you'll stay
Go now before it's too late
Go now before it's too late
Then he got famous and left all of his fans in the dust
And your relatives always miss you at family occasions
And your mother misses you too
Since all the fortune you've been too busy recording
Now she feels unimportant and your daddy's been going through it
Since he lost his mother
I never thought you would sell out
You're becoming so cocky
I asked you for a picture after your show
Ain't this the dude that said that it ain't about the price tag
Now on your records all that you do is brag
What happened to Cloud 9 and Generation Lost
And everybody was on him and the world fell in love
I guess he's stopped giving a fuck
For all of his little people
They taste the fame and change likes it just automatic
There's more than what meets the eye
I swear on the Bible you were my idol
Just when I thought I give up on everything
I watched my whole life change in a couple of years
But if it wasn't meant to be this wouldn't be my career
But they never see the ropes and the pulleys and the gears
In the middle of this rap game on the battle field
I call it making a way for our survival
Just when I thought I gave up on everything
You better watch it now if you know what I'm saying
Maddy told Hatty let's not take the chance
Let's look out for someone out there and they want to dance.
Get you someone pretty to pull the wool with you.
Tell me this ain't real
To pay the damn rent or get thrown on the avenue
Should he quit it and settle for minimum wage
He sells it to his neighbor and his best friend
And might even sell it to his girlfriend
He sells it to anyone who wants some
Just so he got a place to stay next month
And you just sell dope and be flamboyant
And this is how the government thanks you
For hundreds of years of slavery
Tell me this ain't real
A brother joins a gang in the projects
Cause his family is broke and he respects the sick
So you know he'd do anything to help out
The day is over so he goes home to hear the fussing and the feuding and the fighting
Cause his family ain't united
Bring your stolen money home to put food on the table
Cause everybody else ain't able
Mom's a sick and complying to the pill
And little brother too young to know
But y'all don't understand the circumstance
A brother got this girl pregnant OK
And if both of them be to school the day of the next day
A some of that doped up white stuff
But as times get hard and times get rough
His best friend comes around and he's selling
Then maybe the two of them can hit a lick
Then he'd come back with studio equipment
Then when he licks seven days a week
And in the daytime all they do is that cheese
While away his wife and his baby would shriek
You might hate him and call him a prankster
But y'all don't understand the circumstance
I gotta wad too much to grab so I pulled out a dollar put the rest in the dash
The wash and the wax costs 5.95 and in fact even the plush was 2.99
So we put on the lights and rushed them off
It took a sweat to get the freaks number
And before I leave I hit the switch
Rolled down the straw for Stevie's on the strip
I had cornbread and steak with gravy and rice
A woman and a dude walked through the door
So I sat at the table to keep them some more
The dude came to order walked to the back
But the waiter called me cause my order was through
Picked up my food while it was still kissing
Both grabbed the dude and I grabbed Tracy
But simply I'm proud and low down
All the boys in the hood knows what time it is
The color of darkness or animals
Black is blind man's vision
It's the culture of a man that's willing to accept any history and name with respect
One that'll learn his story from another race
In a different language and another place
Policy or licensed community extermination of a racial population
Wisdom even is oppressed by the government
Made a ready killer because of another sin
Hell place because most of them lack pigmentation of the skin
Mine is brown so what is black
The shade of the solar system
What is black and where do blacks come from
What's the difference
One is a queen and the other played the queen on the movie screen
When there is no resemblance
And the actors of the movies didn't have the slightest blemish of darkness to represent the people
I'm dark cause of the color I don't lack
But I'm a dark shade of brown
Our blood line is strong cause the weak ones died in the journey on to this land
And before I accept any name handed down to me
I have one question to ask
What is black and how am I black when I'm dark brown
Manipulative minds have no heart
Hoping to have a heart transplant
Take brains away and even take names away
Some ask why wouldn't I fight for my country
Maybe it's because America isn't my country
And before I'm willing to be accepted as a true American
What is black and is it inferior
The more is broke in town the government gets scarier
United snakes of America
We're preparing to take a stand
A stand that's tearing your whole government inside out to conquer the white
Intelligent blacks built pyramids
The extremities today of the world we're living in
Dreams of a unity but we keep giving in
It's hard enough we have to struggle and fight without malathion getting sprayed in our eyesight
Before we sell out it's time for me to tell out
Seeing all this corruption gave me the notion
Politicians pave their way in and they lie to you
Another baby was born the other day
But it's a part of the world that we live in
Depression is slowly coming down like rainfall
One drop hits the ground and breaks all the races apart
Probably get a KKK of a different kind
Cause negative rides over positive ten times
Tell all the kids about the future or the time you get misled
Going to war though is none of our business
News at eleven what the hell is going on
Another brother killed for the color of a crayon
We try teaching love in this family
I see the transparent eyes of another world
A middle aged man just molested a young girl
And waiting for the bus a young boy got shot
And an innocent man got beat up by a cop
Unity to every peace goer and make some positive note
Because peace shall overcome
I stand tall with a flag of all colors
Lead us to the promised land
There shouldn't be a reason to betray peace
Like why can't the west be played in the east
It's the world that we live in
Now let's stand hand to hand
Brother man to brother man
We have to been to and have to give in to
Are you stupid or your mind is a pebble
To think that we betray our race or way of culture
Your mind is a vulture
You may have taken off freedom on land
The army though they could draft me in a battle
The fact that they tried to lie me into slavery
Cause it'll never change the fact that I'm black
My Mama always told me I could do what I wanted to do
But she didn't mean hanging with a crew of gangsters
That I used to hang with
And the dope dealers that I wanted to sling with
She said it in many different ways
To strive cause hard times bring brighter days for the future
So I had to chill and work on my music before I got killed
Times got hard so we skipped town
Mama always told me to respect him
But he rejected me so I reject him
And I didn't wanna hear about him
I used to try to call
Now I learned to live without him
And even though Mom would try to moan me to love him
For Mom always told me
Your Mama's so bad man that she
My Mama always told me to be a young gentleman
Because in the future I had to learn
To get me a job and save what I earn
Praise the mighty God and listen to the preachers
But now everything changes
Mom had to moan me so that I would remain a gentleman
And not a little dumb man
Mom always told me to study
I understand why she had to me stoat me
But Mom always told me
She used to tear my butt up
My Mama always told me I had to be responsible
But where I grew up it was impossible for me
Not to get in any kind of trouble
And whatever I did the punishment was double
But I couldn't find anything at the bottom of my beer bottle
My Mom was my role model
So we could have a feast
At least she didn't give up hope
Or get strung out on dope
I had to live life as Mom's little boy
But I was never wild or a problem child
My Mom still hat to stoat me
But Mama always told me
Cause khakis and rags will put you in a body bag
Walking down the street get sprayed by a mag
Selling all that dope wont buy a brand new Jag
Pygmy braids in you hair looking like a fag
Maybe it's a game shooting up your brother man to get a brand new name
They knew the same thing
The rival gang's looking for you
They have enough of that hard stuff
About as hard as processed plastic
But instead you're hard stuffed in the casket
And that's about as hard as you'll ever be
Because the police and other gangs are the same
And start reading books not graffiti with that spray paint you use
Instead of being put behind a girder at night
Waiting for the day to get killed
Cause instead of job applications you're making out a will
And get paid legally instead of that illegal junk
You don't listen to your parents
Just listen to me and take my advice
I guess you think you're hard with all the damage you've done
But I bet you be a little punk if you didn't have a gun
And all the clothes you wear look so cute
Instead of walking round looking like you get so worked up
The deputies will give you the attention you need
Beat you down with a beat stick and laugh while you bleed
These riddles I write
In the middle of the night
With a little bit of spice
I'm not a literal type
So I consider it wise
Of my physical flight
Let the pinnacle rise
Till the minute is ripe
Welcome when it arrives
At the end of my life
At the edge of the knife
On disrupting silences with an iron fist
Einstein and Darwin are partners I enlist
Matter is energy trapped in genetic memory
I gather it into me and capture it vividly
When adapting it into these raps with intensity
Photocopied poems thrown in the shopping cart
Innocent ears listen as fear and sin disappear
I'm an anomalous phenomenon
It tastes like an aphrodisiac when I fashion it
Exact craftsmanship like renaissance art
I begin to come apart when the song starts
Drawn in sharp contrast to common sparks
That's when I rap to the fat drum sound
I wrap my tongue around the claps and pounds
About to relinquish diminishing grips
Witted English linguistic brinkmanship
I'm an anomalous phenomenon
Why I flow with a seamlessness that approaches perfection
And openly question those with Jehovah's protection
My most hopeless obsession is with my own reflection
So I suppose the impression I give is narcissistic
As harsh as it is to have my worst parts listed
Invented in the intention to blur sensual curves
I was sent to this earth with unconventional words
Which I intend to disperse until some tension is purged
I'm an anomalous phenomenon
All it takes is two lips to make this music
And compose soundtracks to show how in fact
I know how to rap and got my flows down pat
My breath crests the peak and gets swept beneath it
Will curse every critic whose words get me livid
Diverse metaphysics as the earth steady pivots
I can flow at the speed of a sewing machine
Then sit back and sip six packs of fatness
I got a little trouble with cholesterol level
I talk as if I'd never been taught to quit
In a din of adrenaline like winning a cock fight
I rip apart a track when I start to rap
Coroner's report said the tests were extraordinary
I couldn't shut off the flow and just talk softly
And so instead of an out of court settlement
I chose to live and overdose on adrenaline
Whenever I flex it's like pleasure injected
A Sorcerer's apprentice with swords of tempered steel
I'm known to set the mood but don't get it confused
I talk as if I'd never been taught to quit
In a din of adrenaline like winning a cock fight
Rappers with flaccid erectile tissue
Get blasted with massive projectile missile
Like after raw sex with no contraceptive
Like electric voltage. I get no kicks
My style cannot really be clocked visibly
And so my flow seems like a ghost in the machine
That goes between what I say and what I'm supposed to mean
I talk as if I'd never been taught to quit
A damsel with a dulcimer
Could I revive within me
That with music loud and long
And drunk the milk of Paradise.
To keep every word I've read close beside me
Inspiring me to never go quietly
I'm posturing like I'm the offspring of Oscar Wilde
But I've got to make clear that since my eighth year
I've been possessed by Shakespeare and William Blake's spirits
And Percy Shelley is the first to tell me just
How to speak out of turn and keep my verse rebellious
And my zeal is unwelcome in George Herbert's church
To keep every word I've read close beside me
Inspiring me to never go quietly
For a challenge I'm known to approach talent shows with
Poems that I stole from Edgar Allen Poe's lips
Opium hits dope Alexander Pope's wits
I was Samuel Coleridge in a trance when I wrote this
And I awoke with the whole song done
In a form with the fingerprints of Henry Vaughn
To keep every word I've read close beside me
Inspiring me to never go quietly
As a poet I'm conscious of the goals I accomplish
But I already got the skills to thrill a Goddess
In strange surroundings my grasp clutches
Fell and splintered at my feet like Alan Ginsberg
To keep every word I've read close beside me
Inspiring me to never go quietly
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
In what distant deeps or skies
Burnt the fire of thine eyes
On what wings dare he aspire
What the hand dare seize the fire...
As holy and enchanted
By woman wailing for her demon lover...
Who'd stoop to blame this sort of trifling
Stamped on these lifeless things...
Let us roll all our strength and all
Our sweetness up into one ball
And tear our pleasures with rough strife
Through the iron gates of life
Ultraviolet blazes inside this cave
A device to flip memory bites through my lips
It's the cyclone life of the microphone
Like a hangman's noose in front of the dance floor
Each night paying dues I stand on a trap door
And I'd like to thank the muse at the plentiful rap source
So crank the juice and let the energy blast forth
I'm gonna be forced to take advantage of this amplification
To state my plans for this planet's emancipation
I've managed the transformation to a standing ovation
Just peaceful discussion and powerful beat production
Ultraviolet blazes inside this cave
A device to flip memory bites through my lips
It's the cyclone life of the microphone
Screeches travel through the tweeters jacked up with each pass
And when people react to these unique speech acts
It creates an equally fast species of feedback
I need that positive twist to write these raps
The props that I get increase my peak capacity
And my abilities increase the props that I get
It's a simple and deep fact of cause and effect
The only problem is stress and system overload
If they're not given proper rest microphones can blow
Hand printed and typed songs invented at night
Ultraviolet blazes inside this cave
A device to flip memory bites through my lips
It's the cyclone life of the microphone
Relationships built with microphones based on skill
It's more than just the taste of a meal that makes it appeal
It's more than just the shape or the face on the bill
That dictates its place in the till or the amount of it
Beware of counterfeit poets at shows who don't know how to spit
But the system predates the green age of the icon
Ultraviolet blazes inside this cave
A device to flip memory bites through my lips
Freedom of birth has rooted me from the first
I chant this to replenish
Like a sandwich when you're famished
Under bandages my hand is
By the handle grip to brandish
My shovel as I plant this
Great expanse of forest vanished
Where the planet has been branded
Trees get slammed into the slanted
Land with frantic speed I dance with
An enhanced sense of romantic
And I can't get disenchanted
Clocks tick six year as I walk between trees
And the slash is deep with distracting green leaves
To pass me you have to be released by a catapult
And every word that I speak is autobiographical
My shredded legs keep me upright to levitate
I've got to measure space and do whatever it takes
Some nights I lie in bed awake and shiver and shake
But I never let a late night get in the way
And when I've got to separate my head and escape
I chant this to replenish
Like a sandwich when you're famished
Under bandages my hand is
By the handle grip to brandish
My shovel as I plant this
Great expanse of forest vanished
Where the planet has been branded
Trees get slammed into the slanted
Land with frantic speed I dance with
An enhanced sense of romantic
It takes individuals to make statistics
With sophistication the shapes get shifted
The risks we take make the race ballistic
So shake your fist or get fatalistic
I've gotta make a list of reasons why I'm not a fatalist
That's not a way to live with the weight of this world the way it is
Or shake your tits and wait tables for minimum wage and tips
Watching the latest clips of fallen dictatorships
Whether it's done consciously or unconsciously
Whether you walk nonchalantly or run constantly
Whether you live under palm trees or march to the drum's beat
Complicity comes back to haunt your sleep
Inside these songs of freedom the soul longs to speak
Sometimes you can't see the cause of cosmic grief
It takes individuals to make statistics
With sophistication the shapes get shifted
The risks we take make the race ballistic
So shake your fist or get fatalistic
With radiophones they bring the sword to stones
And lay poor bones to decay in war zones
As the oldest poems and ancient lore known
Gets ignored and thrown on the floor when the door's blown
A sore groan rises from inside the Sorbonne
As another throne tries for the glory of Rome
But even the biggest assholes and total wackos
Must have souls that reflect the supernatural
They just catch colds and forget about the macro
It takes individuals to make statistics
With sophistication the shapes get shifted
It takes individuals to make statistics
With sophistication the shapes get shifted
It takes individuals to make statistics
With sophistication the shapes get shifted
The risks we take make the race ballistic
So shake your fist or get fatalistic
Spirit sickness grows deep as we dig ditches
And even those who witness the sickness just get suspicious
There's so many pernicious ways to earn riches
And so many kitchens bursting with vermin and dirty dishes
Like a flag incineration on a day of veneration
A sleeping dragon's been awakened and the next generation
Will face the implications and waste their innovations
Building gates to defend their nation against the hateful vengeance taken
On the same men impatient to put limitations
Balancing eight platters of words on a straight ladder
I'm shaken up worse than World Trade Center structures
Reluctant to say that I've just been taken upwards
I need to be chained up and fed some plain custard
And tell the doctors there to be careful and not bury me
And keep me there until I'm cheerful as a cocky parakeet
Apparently when I talk someone at the top's scared of me
I only shave my hairy cheeks once every week
So I go try to flow nice at shows and it's no dice
And grow spiteful of my previous oversights
Beats like these might backfire like motorbikes
Turning higher learning into passionate desire
So hook this black wire to the amplifier
And get blasted by a verbal crack supplier
It's like all depression gets left outside
Thunderous beats shake the ground underneath
Hundreds of feet that jump and leap and thump drunkenly
Beneath the trunks of people who've all come to see
With two lungs to breathe and a mind composed
To rhyme blindfolded on high vinyl ropes
And drive winding roads disinclined to doze
I won't let my eyes close till it's my time to go
As I find the signposts to keep me oriented
To keep me soaring into the morning with no resentment
To give me more incentive to get my stories printed
Ignoring poor intentions until this party's ended
And then bounce around when the record sound spins
I'm out to move mountains with a fountain pen
And then step down proudly in the crowd and grin
To the only place I have where I'm still safe at last
As I trace my path through this race of rats
My style has been stifled by my most intense rival
Who resides in my throat and prevents my arrival
Until the moment I lift this microphone to my lips
Then every poem is a glimpse of a solar eclipse
As cold as the polar tips before greenhouse gases
I bring out raps at extremely loud bashes
Where senile bastards read from out the classics
But my name is a prison and my goals remain distant
I'm unable to make decisions between fame and wisdom
And use subtle notes to describe crushed hopes
Depictions of women and kids gripped in grimaces
Diminish in a mist as the fiction finishes
Pictures of innocence begin to evaporate
I've been too fascinated with tragic fates
Where friends congratulate and there's pleasure and pain
Where the earth forever remains but it's never the same
It just gets better with age like the veterans claim
As I sever the chains at the end of my noose
And let energies loose to get my enemy's goose
And have an old school Roman orgy
Before the plague made rap so dangerous
Back to a place where the most contagious
That's when the pagans would go out naked
To dance and play and have wild relations
This place is a nomad oasis
Where people go mad or go back to basics
As some grow fat on soul saturations
I'm so glad I know where that place is
Where no rat races sow active hatred
And have an old school Roman orgy
And no one in the downtown core is sober
A cornucopia of gorgeous odors
And no more extortion of foreign cultures
Where people get treated like organ donors
Bulldozers or border closures
An no courts either to lord it over
And no poor workers and remorseless owners
Party like the weight of all chores and homework
Is born no more by mortal shoulders
And have an old school Roman orgy
We got garbage haulers and Barbie dolls
And let the bar flow like a waterfall
As unconscious bodies get carted off
I know it's hard to stop when the jar is involved
But it's not your fault if you drop the ball
And the floor ain't really that far to fall
And your home ain't really that far to crawl
So don't give no thought to the smartest call
And have an old school Roman orgy
With a guitar in my hand
Like footprints in the sand
The rivalry that lives inside of me is so explosive
But sometimes I need to go with the flow a bit
I know this little island in the sea where the lotuses
In Homer's myth it's known as the home of the Lotus Eaters
And I'm a devoted seeker of the ultimate high
It's like I go to sleep thirsty and wired all the time
So I'm slow to speak words to describe how sublime
The flowers you find in this place taste
If you believe in religion imagine heaven as a state
I feel like a demon driven to this heathen existence
That I've seen in a vision like a gleam in the distance
Though I admit feeling a bit of a sneaking suspicion
That I've seen it retreating when I've been within inches
With a guitar in my hand
Like footprints in the sand
I saw fish in the sky
I saw stars in the sand
My brain is aware of nothing but distractions
Dreams and carefree bohemian passions
A stranger's hair smells like frankincense
Reacting to veins impaired by pathogens
I have to cleanse myself and take my life back again
This is what happens when people like me get tethered
And keep seeking the treasure found in deep reading matter
I can't even measure how long I've been inside relaxed
Gradually digesting in Venus Fly Traps
These things in life that I can't explain
Intoxication it bleeds my brain
But I need my strength
I feel like I'm a beast on this beach all I want is peace
With a guitar in my hands
As I stand inanimate a minute in this distant land
With one open eyelid left behind on this blind island
Like footprints in the sand
My inner dilemma's been expanding as long as I've been in this trance
I had to sacrifice the afterlife to feed my appetite
I saw fish in the sky
I listened to my heartbeat and start to weep wishing to die
I saw stars in the Sand
But instead of letting hardships win I make departure plans
I wait for the morning light to make contact
I'm already intrigued by what I see ahead of me
A phosphorescent sea stirred by a western breeze
That carries a pleasant tune with a resonant beat
And a collection of ruins where earth and heaven meet
Sacred temples and tombs where spirits live and breathe
His headpiece and beckons to me impatiently
As a second priest prepares a place for me next to his seat
And I obey his decree on shaky feet breathlessly
And leave the safety of the beach in a state of ecstasy
And proceed to the left of the priest and then stare
As the high priestess descends the temple stairs
And she's dressed in expensive layers
That keeps the rest of them all meek and scared
For a moment the image hovered in my vision and doubled
And then the next thing I know I'm back under my covers
As the medicine man prays to the source
And spin as he chants and shakes a bundle of plants
His lungs expand and flows of cigarette smoke
I think I just lost control of my wits in this pitch dark
The medicine man sits with a candlestick
Subtle about the rapture and passionate suffering
Attached to the cluttered path of cash coveting
Corruption contaminates the task of governing
Consumption demands massive gas guzzling
Above I see the sword of Damocles hovering
Assassins set to dispatch another king
Sending some scuttling back under mother's wing
I can't help wondering how the dream was killed
I blame myself and accept the shame and guilt
To play the game well and chase fame and wealth
Couldn't clue into the fact of the illusion's enchantment
Until I sat on the ruins of the last human advancement
Madness rages in a string of profanity
All that's left of an age of insane vanity
Condensed into one case of vain insanity
As animals watch the last corpse from Titanic sink
And begins replenishing all the damaging things
That we did with our hands while micromanaging
Now we're back to the last days of weapon brandishing
And cancel that command on the satellite link
Remind me of mankind's past irrelevance
You can wipe us all out like Florida brown pelicans
And it won't necessarily spell the end of mental elegance
We feel these evolutionary arrogant elements
Or any mammal animal with strands of intelligence
Language and culture eventually will swell again
But all in all I'd rather outgrow the obstacles
Part of the problem seems to be with corporate greed
But they're all just people with kids they got to feed
Lost in a colossal sea of private property
When freestyles combine
And wild minds connect
To produce miles of rhymes
That wrap a thousand times
Around this ball of twine
Still the tower climbs
Encircled in spiral vines
Us closer to cloud nine
It could all turn out fine
Where females marry males
At the end of weary trails
And friends with cherry nails
And grins carry the veils
But the legendary scale
Of it all is very real
With a fear I barely feel
Babel is terribly frail
And threatens to unravel
If the dictionary fails
If we neglect the song
Concealed in the lexicon
In the direction we've gone
And can't resist being drawn
Into a festering swamp
Where no one gets along
And the congested throng
Would give its left arm
Does the question belong
This is the dawn of wordplay
That serves to straight
Purge agitated nerves
And gives words what they deserve
This world is made of words
They were created first
And gave us our naked birth
And kept our place reserved
On the face of this earth
Sacred words taught us
From caves in the dirt
They enable us to flirt
With this elevated perch
And make sure that sages lurk
And the pages are versed
Till they're like slaves and serfs
With an insatiable thirst
Narrate and create mirth
A job with major perks
It's got my crazy bird
I can't stay in one place and chirp
So when my aches converge
To where I can't take worse
No questioning my path
I get my things and dash
I spread my wings and flap
Nothing can bring me back
The way I think and act
Could be linked to the fact
That I've been trapped
My whole life in English class
Where the ink is black
And the paper's white
So when I sing this rap
That's the way I take flight
And relinquish the past
Wide awake late at night
On the brink of collapse
Less afraid of stage fright
With every page I write
With a charismatic presence
And take rap expression
Straight back to its edges
I've been taking magic lessons
Since my days of adolescence
Asking enigmatic questions
And laughing irreverently
At Catholic confessions
But I'm not past lifting
My hands and asking forgiveness
Or learning surrender
I'm having to live with
Fire while burning to cinder
Summer turning to winter
Lumber turning to splinter
Wonder turning to cynicism
All churning in blenders
Serving currency lenders
Is working against us
Like murderous fingers
Holding us with their
And poised to deliver
Destroying and limiting
As a boy I was quicker
I think I'm growing thicker
Stoic I slowly wither
I know it's a stark change
But really there's no difference
When it starts to rain
And the flame starts to wane
Darkness reigns and sharp pains
Plague the heartstrings
And it's hard to maintain
But the blaze can rekindle
If a single spark remains
Babies age from dimples
Into wrinkles and veins
From the Olympic games symbol
To a limp with a cane
Some begin to complain
Every link in the chain
Is made to dwindle and fade
The only way to stay sane
Whatever gets to arise
Is standing next to demise
Like breath moves rhymes
And the flesh we use dies
And never gets two tries
So it's best to utilize
Every blessing in disguise
So guess to get through
And stress reflects blue light
From the coast to the highest
Don't be surprised when
Emotion flies out and
Your throat chokes with sighs
And throws your insides out
From this explosion of rhymes
If you're doped by the sound
And your soul cries out
And ask a question and see where the answer gets you
And see which tactic brings your plans to fruition
It takes a certain base kind of impatient mind
But the truth shall set you free
From those useless superstitious beliefs
With the lyrical equivalent of an elephant's trunk
And celebrate your kinship with the primates
We lived in the dark for so long
Creationism is dead wrong
I'm the manifestation of tens of millions
I'm the best of the best of the best of the best
Of generations of competitive pressure genetically
You and I will find a common ancestor eventually
If we rewind geological time regressively
And I could say the same for this hibiscus tree
And this lizard and this flea and this sesame seed
And if you still disbelieve in what your senses perceive
Then I could even use this rhyme as a remedy
And differential survival when the people listening
Decide what they're into and what really isn't interesting
It changes from place to place and from winter to spring
We lived in the dark for so long
Creationism is dead wrong
Whoever leaves the most spawn
Creationism is erroneous
Some giant problems and find some final results
I think it's time for y'all to let your minds evolve
And listen to a different kind of silent call
Wondering at the infinite depth of divine thought
And realizing that scripture can never define God
So why would he bother designing an albatross
Especially when natural selection does such an excellent job
I say banish God into the gaps
If he can't help us understand the simplest facts
I want a relaxed God of infinite naps
We lived in the dark for so long
Welcome to the Charles Darwin Bicentennial
Maybe because a man was born two centuries ago
To recognize the underlying pattern behind the pageant
He was the first to understand it
The first to translate his amazement
So this is a celebration of Darwin's greatness
A manifestation of the evolutionary equation
The first chapter is about the impact of people's actions
And had no idea how to rework the features
Of a species of sheep or increase the sweetness
Or to feed it or to breed it or to weed it out and delete it
Or if it was just an inner predilection to pick the best in
But there's nothing artificial about domestication
Ant colonies keep domestic aphids
It's just an arrangement where one hand washes the other
And even if there's never a conscious discussion
If our little selections and little preferences
Can change and enhance the critical differences
Between wild and domestic breeds over the centuries
Then maybe that can explain... everything
In nature it isn't us that makes the selections
It's just survival and reproduction in the midst of competition
Where slight differences that arise randomly
Get selected by the pressures applied environmentally
And eventually species divide like a family tree
Rappers all have different techniques when they're on stage
And the results can be seen in the audience's face
Like guppies removed abruptly from their aquatic space
Your minds are probably racing over questions of style and race
This is the rap version of the doctrine of Malthus
It's the proportion of hungry mouths
To food resources in the form of captive audiences
Where crowds of two or more will always
Be at least half as common as performers
Those who aspire to get massive responses
That this is a form of imitation modified by experience
Which is similar to the genetic basis of inheritance
But whether you think cultures really evolve
Or if it's just a silly metaphor that's pretty but false
Or whether you've never even thought about that
I still think Darwin can teach us a lot about rap
Competition for status with intricate language
And witness the evolution of the rap profession
No I wasn't born in Ghana but Africa is my mama
And if it's not plain to see then your eyes deceive you
Tells a story that reasonable people find believable
Africa is the home of our most recent common ancestors
Which means human beings are all brothers and sisters
And then try to tell me that we're not all connected
The fossil record has gaps but no contradictions
And it complements the evidence in your chromosomes
So I came to let you know about your ancestral home
Of all my cousins from the same African mom
A mutation with benefits that offset the costs
My family passed through some adaptive radiations
And then one final migration made us Canadians
So the green is for the envy in the eyes of intelligent design
Advocates and scientific illiterates
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
But when they talk about Jesus and Revelations and Judges
I've gotta take it up with them
But at the dinner table we get on some crazy discussions
I'm always questioning their basic assumptions
That's the idea that most enrages Darwin's detractors
Allow me to illustrate a similar instance
I'm descended from Dutch Calvinist immigrants
And I still have second cousins who live in the Netherlands
Since we have common genetic elements
Inherited from our great grandparents
Which also means all relationships are relatively incestuous
Further back we have common ancestors with chimps
But what I find incredible isn't this principle
What's incredible to me is that some of my living relatives
By a benevolent God and that this same God
Is currently manipulating the elements
Approximately twenty percent of them
And at the dinner table we debate statistics
And those debates get kind of interesting
But when they talk about Jesus and Revelations and Judges
I've gotta take it up with them
But at the dinner table we get on some crazy discussions
I'm always questioning their basic assumptions
As the best explanation we have for living systems
That one percent is quite significant
Those are the creationist scientists who have found signs
Maybe all that evidence scientists say they've collected
So either evolution is the victim of a frame job
Which explains all of its predictive successes
And that's when my sister steps in
Is just as subjective as every other cultural tradition
Except it's just better at pretending to be objective
They're just a way for men to control women's goals
And try to turn us all into Playboy centerfolds
Haven't you heard about that tribe in the Amazon
Where the woman does the man's jobs and hunts and plants the crops
But I know it's a published fact
Because I read about it in my Women's Studies class
And it proves that gender is a socially constructed act
And all I can do is come back with more statistics
About the high percentage of indigenous
Societies where polygamy is prolific
And about human sexual dimorphism
And the different reproductive investments between men and women
Which of course then gets my religious cousins offended
Because it doesn't credit Genesis with our humble beginnings
It's about how much evidence you can marshal
And how you deliver the parcel
That we can reach the genuine article in a rational way
That's a different kind of faith than my cousins have
But when they talk about Jesus and Revelations and Judges
I've gotta take it up with them
But at the dinner table we get on some crazy discussions
I'm always questioning their basic assumptions
You can run but you can't hide forever
A place where kill or be killed is the mentality
Escape from the habitat that you was born in
She's only seventeen and got a bun in the oven
So keep your mouth shut and don't jump to judgment
While I break down some homicide statistics
Why the padlock on every cash box is smashed off
Decisions to discount future prospects
To high risk environments and short time horizons
With high stakes and highly visible prizes
And death is the ultimate plan cancellation
And life expectancy also predicts teen pregnancy
The need to leave a legacy genetically
Especially when you can see them adjusting actively
You see people adapting to their situations
And it's the same in different places and with different races
This is not about ethical justifications
Because of our reaction when violence happens
But if we really want to change the outcome
Then maybe we should just start questioning how it's adaptive
And the bottom line is that inequity and life
Expectancy are the ultimate causes of crime
The two combine together in a feedback loop
Just don't ask me what I'm about to do
But my tribe lives on every country on earth
I'll do anything to protect them from hurt
The human race is what I serve
We actually get to the end of the time of tribalism
As man advances in civilization
And small tribes expand into larger bases
That's it's not that difficult to extend our instinctual
Sympathies to all members of one nation
But I know there's nothing to stop me extending this basic
Sympathy to the people of all nations and all races
Extending his imagination and formidable mind
Into a future where all human sympathies combine
But my tribe lives on every country on earth
I'll do anything to protect them from hurt
The human race is what I serve
Motivated by affection and reciprocity
But that philosophy's got the whole world blind
If violence is an instinct it's not entirely senseless
But the logic of human destiny is reciprocal altruism
Yes we can change our perspectives
And as soon as this is widely comprehended
Then I predict we'll be as calm as Galapagos finches
But my tribe lives on every country on earth
I'll do anything to protect them from hurt
Survival of the fittest is such a bleak vision
Are we really just a freakish collision of selfish genes
By anybody out to justify the meager existence
By parasites eager to benefit from these differences
In the nineteenth century it was aristocratic eugenicists
And gangsters still use it today to degrade their victims
Not to mention the purveyors of disaster capitalism
But none of this is based on scientific evidence
Merely showing that something exists in a state of nature
Competition can sometimes increase motivation
But evolution is also driven by cooperation
And became the organelles within their symbiotic shells
And we have fifty trillion of those in our individual selves
So we're like physical spaces where creative collectives dwell
And this applies to the societies we erect as well
And the fittest group makes the best combined moves
Group selection just puts me in an altruistic mood
And you don't have to reciprocate either
Because karma is a sophisticated teacher
Cheater detection will keep you in check when
You jump cues and refuse to treat people respectfully
Liars and thieves and those who try to deceive
Get dealt with by the immune systems of society
And my attitude is there's nothing we can't do
We can go to the moon and back this afternoon
As long as what's bad for me is also bad for you
So let's just all get together and have some food
And imagine the competitive advantages
That would come with recognition if you have the gift
Of the handsome prince whose attention she catches
All because they have this gift with craftsmanship
Now take it from the master of the adjectives
Deep into the subconscious of the obnoxious
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your turns of phrase
So even though you're still broke I love you anyway
So now this whole rap thing seems awfully strange
And makes the females catch a powerful urge
Just like a style of verse or an amazing flow
But it takes dedication and it takes a toll
I'm cocky and single and I got your genes tingling
Is the offspring we'll bring into the world
Charles Darwin saw natural selection as the most serious cause
And then Darwin had a curious thought
It probably occurred to him while explaining his theory
A mixture of desire and feverish awe
The immediate cause of which Darwin clearly saw
The struggle for survival and reproduction
These are all traits that sexual selection has shaped
Through the female preference to get with the fittest mates
But in human beings that selection goes both ways
Pretty much anything that's just for display
And isn't meant dissuade or chase predators away
Was probably selected for in a sexual way...
Doesn't mean that people only use it just to get laid
But that doesn't mean the penis evolved as bush fire fighter
This is a theory of language function
The grand unified theory of rhyme
And for mates of the more temporary kind
These are the humble roots of the literary sublime
We're all just Shakespearean primates verbalizing our cherry behinds
We could observe which breeding pairs reproduce
And how often they use their verbal ornaments to seduce
We could even separate them into control groups
To see whether male or female vocals
Are more prone to be used to stimulate hormones
If only there existed in a state of nature
Danger of being overwhelmed by angry player haters
But I may have to save some of my research for later
And how do I answer the charge that I'm participating
I worked hard to achieve this ability
And if it also gives my genes visibility then so be it
To attract any nubile young females
It does attract women a lot though
I get mobbed after my Chaucer shows
By grandmas thanking me for making it possible
But that's how sexual selection works
Any mutation gets tested first
Where it gets crossed with literature and lectures
Will probably get the burial that it deserves
I'm cocky and single and I got your genes tingling
Is the offspring we'll bring into the world
Acid is what we are made of
Strands of double helix
Are where all these bodies came from
In the story of life on this crazy planet
It's a microscopic information package
Called deoxyribonucleic acid
The DNA strand has the same basic plan
Has the same proteins with a certain percentage
Of the same genes arranged identically
Has a shared ancestor with every living thing
This is true for Jews and Christians and Sufi mystics
And Buddhists and every religion and superstition
If you can listen to this it means you're passing through
This existence on a wave of DNA
And you're just one of its newest inventions
Acid is what we are made of
Strands of double helix
Are where all these bodies came from
Now if you want me to tell you how a simple molecule
Could build bodies so well with such an obvious wealth
Except that one in every million is a slight improvement
Changing and growing and competing for mates
Like how animals and plants all behave in the wild
So next time you shake hands or break dance
The information that makes your brains and hands
Acid is what we are made of
Strands of double helix
The first version of this rap was pretty primitive
And that's all I could think of
And evolution is really an algorithm that goes
So the genetic code of every living creature was written
And revision occurs in the random changes
And natural selection is the feedback side
That's about who survives and whose genes catch rides
Is that a rap performance like this is the best illustration
Of the way descent with modification works
To decide which have an impact and which to send back
And mutations occur when I improvise on stage
And anyone can use this algorithm to learn anything
In 1859 Darwin spilled the first splashes
Burning human arrogance into ashes
In exactly the same way that Copernican math did
The acid burns into the superstitious side
It even dissolves the original sin of pride
And my creator has given me dominion over nature
And he has the power to replenish his creatures
It plucks the arrogance deep from within the hearts of man
And teaches us never to build our houses on sand
But instead to try to understand why we're here
One species among millions in this biosphere
Combined to give us this great survival gear
If this is just a game that organisms are trapped in
Genetically adapting to environmental factors
Consists of organisms adapting to environments
They were the finalists in the genetic Olympic Games
Every one of your ancestors lived to reproductive age
And they were all better than their competitors at getting laid
There's something inspirational in this vision of Darwin's
Organisms are part of an environmental mix
Just try to imagine how natural selection applies
To countries that have industrialized
Companies live and companies die
And when customers buy based on a company's green plan
Cultural evolution is ours to reinvent
And when we choose who to sleep with and reproduce
Our sexual choices affect the gene pool
Can play the part of environmental pressures
Where justice increases over egotism
And after we get to look back and see how we impacted it
The blind stares of a million pairs of third eyes
That they will never see
I'm a voracious reader and a ruthless questioner
Whenever I see science get popularized
And acquire knowledge that's really authentic
That's how we know the solar system is heliocentric
And that's how we know Charles Darwin's theory was right
And every living creature is connected through the tree of life
For the same reason human beings lie to themselves
You can't tell which parts of my signal are costly
Your cheater detection instincts can't detect me
The blind spot in your vision that your mind has to fill up
Just imagine what else you can't see
So just close your eyes when you listen to rap
And you'll find a microcosm of the human mental map
Everything from costly signals to kin selection
That's simply how the human mind has been designed
That's why my mom thinks that I'm the greatest rapper alive
That's why rappers are so obsessed with fornicating
Whether a job application or a chat with the person next to you
And let my identity be a total surprise
And you get to earn respect if I turn out to be awesome
And every choice is a trust that others have a chance to abuse
And that's why we inhabit the world of cheater detection
And that's why costly signaling is naturally selected
But the one thing we have evolved to catch is cheats
You can pray and meditate until you're blue in the face
An alliance between rap and rationalism
Darwinism is just preposterous
Just use biology to advance their hateful atheist doctrines
But the bible teaches us that human nature is fallen
Because we fell into temptation with original sin
Evolution isn't just a failed theory with a lack of proof
It's also a direct attack on moral absolutes
Without the bible you can't even say Hitler was bad for the Jews
So don't even bother showing me the bones of a stegosaurus
Now the monkey swings by the end of his tail
As he flies from tree to tree
Well there may be monkey in some of you guys
But there ain't no monkey in me
And there ain't no bugs on me
There ain't no bugs on me
There may be bugs on some of you mugs
But there ain't no bugs on me
Just on you liberal freaks...
When science explains religion then we'll have a compromise
But not the specific magical claims
Proposition for conservative religions
Moral psychologists have a definition that's simple
Liberals like myself are just higher in a stable
But novelty is the place where parasites breed
Which gives us a delicious little testable prediction
For the scientific method to consider
Namely that openness to experience and liberalism
Can be predicted by the local threat of infectious disease
There ain't no bugs on me
There ain't no bugs on me
There may be bugs on some of you mugs
But there ain't no bugs on me
So let's celebrate every universal of humanness
Like the fact that xenophobia is an immune defense
Where the brain gets a signal from the lymphatic system
And fundamentalism is the same kinda fear
Openness correlates with intelligence moderately
And they think I'm retarded for being a Darwinist
Apparently arbitrary religious messages
Put a towel down to save the sheets and go till three in the morning
There ain't no bugs on me
There ain't no bugs on me
There may be bugs on some of you mugs
But there ain't no bugs on me
And you all decide to memorialize the poor old guy
As a committed liberal I can see both sides
But everyone has a bit of a conservative bias
More xenophobic in their first trimester
So next time you listen to Nick Griffin or Glenn Beck
Just think of it as an immune system imbalance
Like a pregnant woman who pukes every time she eats salads
And if you wanna see the end of oppression in Palestine
Is water sanitation and a vaccination agenda
So let's all just sing along to the words of wisdom
It's the germ theory of conservatism
There ain't no bugs on me
There ain't no bugs on me
There may be bugs on some of you mugs
So if she's right then the menstrual blood of women is actually different form the blood you get when you cut your finger.
If you take the time to listen to enlightened mystics
What can Darwin teach me about the transcendental experiences
But it's a theory for which science has no clear rebuttal
Only through love and compassion that the spirit side emerges
And rappers are channeling that spirit when they recite their verses
Rappers wanna brag about a seven figure salary
I've planted seven figures worth of trees by hand
With ten fingers in the dirt since the age of seventeen
Planting trees is kinda like the game of life
You get paid for your efforts and never paid for your time
And you gotta coordinate with the person next to you
And efficiency is created by collective rules
And there's another line of trees that you're leaving behind
And the space between trees is three meters wide
And the goal is to never have to cross over trees
Just fill the open space on the block economically
And never make another planter walk over trees
If I cheat and you don't cheat then I profit
If you cheat and I don't cheat then you profit
And people on teams can achieve some deep pockets
It's like a sophisticated game of follow the leader
Where the lead player changes every couple of meters
And it's easy for opportunists to try to take advantage
But reputation is the most effective way
With the threat of the loss of their option to participate
But a lot of people like to work in pairs so they can chit chat
And we live in camps of several dozen who interact
And sometimes we seem to move with a group mind
The coordination comes from simple local rules
That combine to produce the most cogent moves
The same way your neurons compose you
If I cheat and you don't cheat then I profit
If you cheat and I don't cheat then you profit
And people on teams can achieve some deep pockets
The point is about where your interests lie
But in modern society we live cooperative lives
And cooperatives are the best place to catch free rides
Is a snitch from the perspective of honest citizens
And the Kyoto accord is a dilemma for prisoners
But the system only works if the members see an active
Life is just an iterated prisoner's dilemma
If I cheat and you don't cheat then I profit
If you cheat and I don't cheat then you profit
And people on teams can achieve some deep pockets
The prisoner's dilemma is part cooperation
And the better we understand it
The better our chances of surviving
It's one of the central planks of the modern humanist view
And science is an important tool if you wanna fly to the moon
So the brain is like a lump of clay just waiting for a sculptor
Instead of celebrating the diversity of human symbols and languages
They think it's all chained to genetic entanglements
Which means there's no room for change and constant moral evasiveness
Just prostitutes and gangsters and thugs
I wouldn't know why but I'd probably wanna tip her
But you can't tell if you're on a contraceptive pill
But right now something makes me wanna be with you
Fast and cheap and headed for the landfill
Is a price that evolution sets
But there's a bit of an imbalance between a woman and man
It takes a few decades to show the kid how it's done
Just because you're contributing hundreds of times
You want me to promise never to sleep with another woman again
As long as I didn't fall in love with her
You also want me to invest every possible resource
It's your limitations that I'm trying to adapt to
You're not the one with the potential to inseminate
Which puts us in a shit negotiating position
I wouldn't know why but I'd probably wanna tip her
But you can't tell if you're on a contraceptive pill
But right now something makes me wanna be with you
Hardier kids whose immune systems give them longer to live
And you have this fertility cycle that gives you subtle clues
To convert my mating effort into parental solicitude
You could have evolved a pink swollen genital symbol
To maintain your competitive edge and get repetitive sex
From the same guy long enough to see your genetic relatives fledged
I wouldn't know why but I'd probably wanna tip her
But you can't tell if you're on a contraceptive pill
But right now something makes me wanna be with you
But we can measure it and how it affects your preferences
What changes is your preference for specific traits
And the relative weight you assign them in potential mates
And guys with no resources but high creativity
When just a week before you were all about liquidity
These are obviously adaptations to maximize the genetic
Quality of your offspring at the expense of wannabe
Basically it takes everything that makes you adaptively moist
And replaces it all with rational choice
Instead of trying to get pregnant by a stud
It's just paternity uncertainty that tears us up
It's kind of like hiring a contractor for your house
You almost always have to choose two out of three
But unless you're name happens to be Angelina Jolie
You might just have to choose two out of three
I understand that reproductive choice feels awesome
But if you don't ovulate then you can't smell a match
And mismatched relationships just don't tend to last
I wouldn't know why but I'd probably wanna tip her
But you can't tell if you're on a contraceptive pill
Assembling in these dense colonies
Provides the social stimulation
That is the key to coordinating their breeding
Tonight's documentary presentation
Of one of the most remarkable creatures in all creation
Of a monogamous constitution
But the truth is slightly more elusive
As is often the case as evolution advances
The preferred strategy depends on circumstances
Look to these elaborate courtship dances
Males and females congregate
In large colonies to display their traits
But so much flesh will not go to waste
And it's now that the advantages
Of breeding in such dense colonies become clear
They've come to breed
Note the sexual dimorphism
The enlarged male form is invariably caused
By competition for female attention
But the females also compete
For male parental investment
Has a grotesquely prolonged adolescence
Given this fact of developmental anatomy
That results in conception requires the participation
There must be a mutual inclination
And it's now that the advantages
Of breeding in such dense colonies become clear
Females can make their choice from many males
While successful males can have access
The quality of mates from a single liaison
To decide whether to allow them to stay on
Concealed ovulation allows frequent mating
With little fear of conception
Which suggests that it's all about the father's genetics
The best ones for feathering the nest
The best ones for siring sexy sons
And it's now that the advantages
Of breeding in such dense colonies become clear
They've come to breed
They've come to breed
They've come to breed
We're gonna work it out
My beautiful producer I just wanna make music
You can run and tell your friends that you've met someone
And we need producers to nurture our seeds
But you'll never find another rapper as dedicated as me
Whoever stands to lose their investment
I get producers pregnant
It's just a simple prediction made by evolution
Females invest more resources
Except for seahorses and a few exceptions
Such as Mormon crickets
We're guided by parental investment
And so are men and women
And I know I'm not the only one who wants your exclusive attention
And you would make me the happiest rapper on this planet by choosing me
And telling the competition you're taken
I will do everything in my power to advance your situation
I like the way your finger toggles so much I wanna put a ring on it
And if you make a song and you need somebody to sing on it
So it's okay if I'm not the last rapper you ever work with
And I might spit some verses on another producer's tracks
But I will see our projects through to the last until they're mastered
And even after that I will never take you for granted
Whoever stands to lose their investment
You're so choosy Simmonds
It's just a simple prediction made by evolution
Females invest more resources
Except for seahorses and a few exceptions
You've been kinda promiscuous
We're guided by parental investment
So you're the woman in this relationship...
Whoever stands to lose their investment
It's just a simple prediction made by evolution
Go ahead and check it out
Females invest more resources
Except for seahorses and a few exceptions
We're guided by parental investment
We're gonna get invested
Whoever stands to lose their investment
You're kinda choosy Simmonds
It's just a simple prediction made by evolution
Females invest more resources
Except for seahorses and a few exceptions
Like some kinds of fishes
We're guided by parental investment
Boom bye bye in the batty boy head
No homo and I'm all about my money
Natural selection offers explanations for
That's something I often say when I'm on a stage
To how much information we've accumulated
So far at least on each specific question
Twin studies suggests that it's partially genetic
Many different threads of evidence are coalescent
But so far it's just suggestive with no consensus
So I'll break down the top four hypotheses in question
Like we find in termites and naked mole rats
With each other when there's not enough males to pull their weight
And maybe lesbians who wanted babies made the same
In many species some males mimic females
So they can mate without having to compete with the alphas
Who guard females jealously and treat them like they're helpless
Boom bye bye in the batty boy head
No homo and I'm all about my money
Hypothesis four tackles pure homosexual bliss
And it mostly consists of genetic tricks
But sometimes you're better off with both different types
If it's connected to some other benefit that's adaptive
And a similar path would be for it to get expressed
If a gene gave males a homosexual proclivity
But it gave females a massive increase in fertility
If it doesn't cause harm then it shouldn't face hatred
But I do have a couple of quibbles.
The first thing is to do with recessive and dominant.
Evolution is the only theory that science hasn't rejected
Evolution even explains why the female chest is so boisterous
And alpha males impregnate the wives of their helpless neighbors
Human beings are socialized to deny their hellish natures
I've been watching you since about 2008
I can't say why our biological parents would want to separate us
And dad and ask them what the hell they were on
Giving up an identical twin for adoption
But I guess they probably had their reasons
An eye but for now I'm just completely surprised
Which elements of the personalities we develop
Can be called the result of the environmental field
That I teach creative writing at a community college
We've been married since 2005
When you were a kid did your adopted parents
But I always wondered whether my language instincts were genetic
Reunion as having a bit more emotional resonance
It's tough to imagine how to even try to work it in
My lifestyle could hardly be more itinerant
The Canterbury Tales for the medieval English class
That time was stressful
I was just an anonymous writer in a big city
And I wasn't confident with women so I lasted six weeks
It's funny how our lives have developed in different ways
Asked the doctor to give her a paternity test on the side
She was just born a bit quickly after that difficult time
One hundred percent DNA test certified
I'm writing this play about...
I'll be interested to hear what you have to say about twins
Some people seem to believe doesn't exist
But common sense suggests that in a contest of wits
We'd all rather have the winners be our family and friends
It predicts the degree to which you'll be curious
And interested in difference instead of scared of it
Different people with different ideas in different areas
Of your mental effort that you put into planning ahead
You really give a damn if people think you're being a dick
It's the adhesive that makes communities stick together
And the number one thing that keeps me from being rich
When life is full of unpredictability
And extreme introverts require video game addiction services
And die as spinster virgins
Of a handful of stable personality traits
And obviously it's an advertisement of brains
Try me and you'll see what I'm made of
And I'm conscientious enough to wanna translate
Science for the masses and help demolish the blank slate
But I think my agreeableness is going down
With each passing year that rolls around
Now I'm more stable than ever in the face storm clouds
It's connecting with people that makes the effort worth it
Would know that I was following psychology trends
But that's when the arguments got intense
I tried to tell them they were wasting their time
And money on all the stuff they were buying
And that it was all just a bunch of fake signals designed
Even if a conversation is a better way to display
It doesn't have to make me massively more
From a young white Canadian
Wannabe G's perspective
To when I wanted to be part of gangster rap
My own hormonal clock ticked over into adolescence
But at least me and my henchmen need to be seen as contenders
Made me a poster boy for the natural selection of inaccurate perceptions
Emulating ghetto boys
Even if we're not in ghetto streets
Exaggerating the threat of violence
That dictates reality
Evolution has no foresight
It moves like a person through a dark forest by torchlight
So we can't expect it to behave nice or known what's right
Suppose you knew your death would be on March 17th when you're 73
It predicts men will breed slightly more promiscuously and women
What does evolution predict that you would do to survive
And they only hook up with the guys that are rich
The ones who cut throats and leave their victims to die in a ditch
Maybe because they don't know how long they're likely to live
Emulating ghetto boys
Even if we're not in ghetto streets
Exaggerating the threat of violence
That dictates reality
My threat level is more effective the less I know myself
So instead of bellyaching on the generation gap
The scope of evolution is truly amazing
And some of them arrived on the scene by violent means
But others arrived by designing minds that dream
And learn how to settle rivalries using things like rhyme schemes
Evolution explains design in nature
As the selective retention of blind variation
And that's exactly how the mind explores design spaces
So it's time to turn the page on that played out nature
So many theories of human nature to choose from
So many competing agendas spinning illusions
So many incentives not to let the truth come
Our psychology has an innate landscape
So don't treat a mountain range like a pancake
And it won't happen if I suck like a lamprey
So how does it feel to be classed with other species
Perhaps then we've reached an impassable disagreement
But that's why the scientific method is genius
You can try to just reject it and deny that it's impressive
But you'll find that it's an excellent device to get your message
So if you find evolutionary psych just offensive
And accuse evolutionists of biasing their efforts
Maybe my interpretation of information is wrong
You recognize me and that's how I get the things that I want
Our psychology has an innate landscape
So don't treat a mountain range like a pancake
And it won't happen if I suck like a lamprey
For me the manipulation of words is just a game
But it's a game that's influential in some interesting ways
It's like their aim is to infiltrate the filters in my brain
Encoded as information in the conscious mental plane
A repetition of a repetition that proliferates
But the pattern of proliferation isn't arbitrary
It's an honorary version of Charles Darwin's theory
That evolve by solving problems in conflict areas
Domesticated by Arabs in response to water scarcity
All these cultural variants reproduce in our minds
But our minds were designed by evolution to blind us
To the truth if lies help us reproduce and survive
That's why falling out of love is always truly surprising
That lets us step outside of our huge thick biases
Our psychology has an innate landscape
So don't treat a mountain range like a pancake
And it won't happen if I suck like a lamprey
Welcome to the future
Better find them a nice
Find them a soft place to land right
I want tomorrow to be
Better than yesterday
That's why I'm all about technology
I'll say fast forward
And if you want the benefits
Then you're hypocrites
Everybody's wish list is
For new toys and tools
And you can have this wish
Just ask the methodological naturalists
And if your spouse gets sick
Consult professionals never novices
Deep down you all know this
To make sure tomorrow is
Whatever scientists can discover
Threatened by science
Bring the future back
Placebo effects and magic
Religion and superstition
You should read Bad Science
And Trick or Treatment
It ain't east vs west
It's about the scientific method
And double blind tests
So you can make claims
But you haven't ruled out
Those placebo effects
To peddle false medicines
And yes it's been tested
Prayer doesn't work against illnesses
In Iraq to detect bombs
People die when you guess wrong
That's why we got double blind tests
And same with homeopaths
And other phonies and quacks
Whatever scientists can discover
When it's justice and life or death
Threatened by science
And you can't bring the future back
Placebo effects and magic
Religion and superstition
You can choose your path
And I don't give a fuck
Just don't try to claim
There's some physical laws
You're just a copycat
And I don't give a fuck
Just don't try to make
Unless you can show us
So now it's time to relax
A couple science facts
Whatever scientists can discover
When it's justice and life or death
Threatened by science
And you can't bring the future back
Placebo effects and magic
Religion and superstition
But we'll still debunk frauds
The dope game hall of fame
I'm in like Jerry Rice
Automatic wit the gadget
When these hollow points scatter
Rowdy than get his roll on
I put hands on that man
I'm from the shoulders
Smoke wit the smokers
From border to border
Blaze your quarter on the freeway
Got the game locked like a boa constrictor
Game tight stitch like a brand new fit
With an all chrome kit
And shake them haters
Wit soldiers ready to bust
But your sharp as a kitten
But the past ain't my style
I smoke a quarter sack
Mayne I told you that

Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh
She ain't having that cause ain't another like papa
And her parents just don't understand
One day we gone get it together
I always paid all my fronts
I don't fuck with no scary punks
Cause loose lips ain't chips in the barrio
Seem like a party though
And I don't even know
And about twelve cousins
And some from Bakersfield
Take it from a prophet
Stay on your toes when you in the black market
I never leaving the pad without
Let them cowards come get me
From all sides love it
So I put it on my stomach
Just me and some real motherfuckers who down to bust
And bubble on the grind
I get the dope fiend money
It's five dollar bills when I wipe my ass
I need to get up out the game
I'm knowing it's wrong
I know I need to listen to the name of the song
I might not be in the pen
But I wouldn't be free
Jay Tee got that hustler mentality
It's the freaky things we do
If they all laugh at you
I know you got them other fools
Who be paying for your jewels
I know you got them superstars
Who be paying for your cars
The girl got degrees in computers off top
So you can't put no salt in my game
And marinate in a hotel room
But you better stick with them bald players
I know you got them other fools
Who be paying for your jewels
I know you got them superstars
Who be paying for your cars
Got you where your fenced to go
I got rules and regulations and guidelines
I guess you got to play the field
To appreciate the way I please ya

Who be paying for your jewels
I know you got them superstars
Who be paying for your cars
Bring that rhythm back
And not enough people who love me
And nobody thinking of me

Now all I wanna do is keep my eyes on the prize
And if that diamond ring don't shine
Look how she freaking young Happy Perez
I done went through all her sisters and cousins
Boy don't you go and throw your life away
Now it seems like yesterday I was on the block running
And what's next for a miss got to greet you
And little roes saying peace to rest of shows
We rode our bikes down to the school to play
Now I done seen a lot of gang fights never end trusted
Doing ten years trying to stack some of that magic
And man I sure do miss him
And I don't ride enough now I'm tripping
Trying to maintain even on a bad day
Late night in the evening
Late night in the evening
Forgive me girl if I damage ya
I told y'all man what I'm fix to do
You know hydro he a friend of mine
Take the monkey off my back like every time
Before I make love I puts it in the air
I gotta get down so I can gets going
Late night in the evening
Late night in the evening
You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceiling
And ooh wee it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
You know its leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
You was there when the money was gone
You'll be there when the money comes
And every time we kick it it's off to the groovy
You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceiling
And ooh wee it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted

And don't miss me wit that dank
500 on the street equals 65 G's
But I sound small I as I is
One thug that had some said that boy Bash
A whole piece I ain't never lied
The smokes killing off my lungs and appendix
Dope house is so relentless
Wit a coffee grinder at my mercy
Cocked mouthed and thirsty gotta keep my spirit lifted though
Your weed hand throw it up and represent your weed
Lit it up wit my nephew
And I didn't even get a hit
No not even a little bit
So now help me get rid of dis
Ask where we get the best of bud
Man look at my eyes they bout to b closed
Ya I no you herd of us
And I can't wait to be alone with you
I bet you ain't never seen a shorty so fly
Now after two honey blunts I discovered the buzz

And through the thick of it all
She excepted collect calls
When the daddy got caught up by the law
And I can't wait to be alone with you
She the girl in the movie and I'm the hero
And came up when she started with zero
Respect when I'm good and love me when I'm in trouble
And I can't wait to be alone with you
I can't wait to be alone with you
Yeah I'm your shorty boy but you already know

Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh
She ain't having that cause ain't another like papa
And her parents just don't understand
One day we gone get it together
Y'all soldiers know my truth be ill.
Dressed in black out to jack me a game plan.
End up on my block saying we the savage.
You act hard round here you gonna get smacked hard.
I'm gonna crack up and smoke with a corona.
Get off them pills and come back to reality...
I changed my life so I can be with you
I changed my life so I can be with you
But you turned and walked away
Somehow I know you still believe
Somehow I know you still believe
You interrupted my bliss
It used to be steak and fish calamari
But now all you do is drink and party
Girl you ain't the greatest the greatest was Ali
In the words of the late great Bob Marley
I count my blessing every time I see my loved ones.
Wondering why I be stressing over a silly woman.
Boy have a good time.
Baby let me free fall.
Me fall for that again
Never will I get caught up again.
Baby girl you done did it.
Money won't buy you happiness
But it will brighten your day.
Sometimes I wanna get away from all the confusion
I know you wish you could run away from this institution
Another day when I'm waking up
All we could do was watch in tears
While the people of America wondered how we let it go down
This old man said pray for me
I got greens fresh off the farm
Let the past be the last thing to dust you son
To the treasure up the post
At a boy without a chance and the Devil on his ass

Capitalize on opportunity

This is ain't nothing new to me
Look at what they do to me
Did dirt with it now I gotta buy the chop
This is ain't nothing new to me
Look at what they do to me
Did dirt with it now I gotta buy the chop
Ten shots with his own spots is all I ever messed with
This is ain't nothing new to me
Look at what they do to me
Did dirt with it now I gotta buy the chop
This is ain't nothing new to me
Look at what they do to me
Looked at the wound and autographed it
And find a way to keep supporting my weed habit
So get down so I can touch you quickly
Cause every blow has nothing but these bad intentions
You know it's leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
You was there when the money gone
You'll be there when the money comes
You know it's leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide

The dope game hall of fame
I'm in like Jerry Rice
Automatic wit the gadget
When these hollow points scatter
Rowdy than get his roll on
I put hands on that man
I'm from the shoulders
Smoke wit the smokers
From border to border
Blaze your quarter on the freeway
Got the game locked like a boa constrictor
Game tight stitch like a brand new fit
With an all chrome kit
And shake them haters
Wit soldiers ready to bust
But your sharp as a kitten
But the past ain't my style
I smoke a quarter sack
Mayne I told you that
I smoke a quarter sack
Mayne I told you that
It's the freaky things we do
If they all laugh at you
I'll be your best friend
Now I'm back in a flesh
Some body told me that the grass was greener
Never really used to be a mean to cheat her
What I gotta do to be a keeper
Freshly molded by the hands of the lord and oh
You're the apple of my eye
I'm feeling like a drug I'm so high
Everything is so sweet
So take a ride with me off in the whip
I'll push the keys to you just let me
Everything is so sweet
Now that's a combination we should be modulating
Crunching on Greek salad under some conversation
And you the chick that I been searching for across the globe
And I just wanted you to know...
Got my mind on my money
Got my money on my mind
She's always on time and never a day late
And me without her is something I can't take
Got me spending weekends in Kingston Jamaica
In love with this cheddar
Me and her go together
Like birds of one feather
She keep me riding on leather
She's my playboy bunny that's sweeter than honeycomb
Got my mind on my money
Got my money on my mind
Sex on the first night
She's doing the thing right
Got them dime pieces making love to my poster
I'm loving this part of the game
And my money ain't genocide I ain't got to explain
Swinging her from lane to lane
We doing the damn thing
Got my mind on my money
Got my money on my mind
I ride my boy on everything
I ride my boy on everything
I ride my boy on everything
Got my mind on my money
Got my money on my mind
So wet wen I park I splash
Super unleaded watch me pimp
Enormous an humongous
I wash it down wit a beer
Let's take it New York and meet a gang of New Yorkers
In and out of the mall
Let's take it overseas to France and Germany
For your ass when the time's right
I'm a take ya to Texas
They ain't ready for what's about to happen
I got the Latins on lock
Shopping sprees at the mall
In the club or in the streets
You must be dumb or blind
If you can't see my kind
We off the party line
We off them trees honey bee
Its where you find me wit ma people
This vodka wit this red bulls got me energized
Want it green as a gecko I'm respectful to some of y'all
Some love a drug addict
But it ain't no excuse
Cause 24 hours ain't enough time in a day
If a peck on the cheek mean death watch for the kiss
Take time under pressure
By any means or measure
Remember one's trash is another man's treasure
The light that I follow might bring me a brighter day
The light that I follow might bring me a brighter day
Now the party didn't start till Dub bailed in
Blue pro fitted tilted to the side of the dome
And make it wobble to the floor
In the Cadillac off of Grey Goose and weed
Motherfucker I'm in the set
So don't make me have to come to your video set
Roll around town with some dank in my pocket
Grandma say Ronnie Ray you need to stop it
Remind me of the breezy from Terminator III
They wouldn't let me on stage they said I was too drunk
My cup got syrup in my soda
I don't give a fuck don't tip my shit ova
Pants so skin tight man so freak like
Please do not get the game crossed up
In order for you not to get tossed up
Whether or not you are flossed up
It is necessary in every pimp's life
And go girl scout cookies lined flat on her back
You know you love her up
But that's what they get for love and shit
Rating these rat chicken traps all day
You trick harder than the NBA
And got mad when your weeds got send my way
Why y'all still go to clubs and handcuff your chicks
I once put a chick in a guillotine choke
Made her steal some new shoes and get me some dough
And this ain't no studio shit
How you think them ugly cats get a beautiful bitch
Now can we kick it out
Your so super natural
Now can we kick it out
Your so super natural
Your handling yo business
I like it when ya shake it
You know that you can take it
Now can we kick it out
Your so super natural
Is that a dance you do
Baby take me to a place
Where my spirits run free
Dance like we in France mama
You the type of chick who loves
Skirts and High Heels
Ain't no trouble when we bubble
Now can we kick it out
Your so super natural
Now can we kick it out
Your so super natural
Now can we kick it out
Your so super natural
I'm a spit some of this real game
It's simple and plain
The Chevy wit the blew out brains
Cop and blow a zip wit Bash
I'm a cross the finish line
Should have brought the Jag
I could tell you stories but can show you cash
Give you game and secrets that I know you'll pass
And he'll break like glass
Some yell it and tell it
I blow it and smoke it and smell it
I got the keys to the Chevy Caprice
I could show you dime pieces in school fashion design
I could show you street lights and heart beak hotels
Down to do what I gotta do to satisfy the man in me
The original digital scale reader
I could reach you and teach you
Life is like a bullet in your back from a close friend
Money was a necessity
My greed got the best of me
I'd rather you respect me than fear me
I came a long way and still I got a while to go
It was the one with pork in it
I don't got all night
Get ya thing together
Get some brain together
I don't see no limits
To be the biggest thing since the fall of the menace
Kick yards like Emit from here to Tennessee
Treats and beach beads
And you can even ask my agent
I'm higher than a fire escape
With seventeen topless models from different countries
Endorse me a chick on the horizon
Now when I walked up to
I jumped in my county
I hit the liquor store
Stepped off the load in my Oakland Raider
We can take over California
I done rather you bring the Hen
Or your broke ass mama
And not the one with pork in it
All money ain't good money
Let it flip like some hood money
All money ain't good money
Let it flip like some hood money
Now I walk around like I got a rock in my sock
Straight to the top till the game lock
You know I gotta rep for my hood and my block
You know we won't stop
Seventy stories or more
To the billion dollar
Me and Bash do things
Ain't nobody gonna stop me now
I'm gonna do everything I can
And ain't nobody gonna stop my flow
You gonna hear me from coast to coast
Somebody's gonna make me mad
And I'm a take everything they have
So put it all in the past
I got the grid locked
Some motherfuckers can't caught blocks
Roley bezel for you got swapped
The city that I represent
And they say money is the root of all evil
But there ain't nothing in this world to make me cross up my people
Its early in the morning
And my heart is really lonely
And I don't know how to take it
But its driving me so crazy
I don't know if its right
And I still can't sleep
I'm feeling hopeless at home
I don't know what to do I think I'm in love
Than what am I feeling
What am I doing wrong
Its just an illusion that I have in my heart
I don't know what to do I'm going out of my mind
We could do this all night now I don't care if you got a man
Baby I wish you'd understand
And I still can't sleep
I'm feeling hopeless at home
I don't know what to do I think I'm in love
Then what am I feeling
What am I doing wrong
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart
I love the way you freak it like that
I love the way you freak it like that
I love the way you freak it like that
Got your boy feel less supreme
Hold up wait a minute baby you so damn independent
Loving everything your representing
And that's what's up and I don't care what people scream
I'm gonna keep it saucy
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart
Now stir that up and add it up
From Mexico to Canada
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Now look at that pepper on the back of that bumper
Even with her girlfriends show stopping with a hustler
She make it hard to copy always tight and never sloppy
And got her entourage and her own paparazzi
Now there she go again riding through the stormy weather
You better button up if you wanna go get her
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
When she break them boys off a typhoon
When them heels get to burning
And got us all doing the tornado
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
When she hit the stage she drop it down low like
It must be the way of the lady
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone

Ronnie Ray... what is it
On some chrome I know you heard it all before
Me and you to put the love to the test
It's so crazy when someone understands your mood
With an open invitation that I can't refuse
Girl you never have to worry when my hands with you
Cherry pie it's so bomb and I can't defuse
I can be your other half baby I'm yo soul mate
I can keep you cozy cause you know that you're my shorty
Seem like you're the only real one who really know me
So this song is dedicated to my one and only
An angel with them eyes and them honey butter thighs
I can be yo lover baby yo best friend
I know what's on yo mind and
I'll be patient I'll be waiting for a very long time
Lets keep it trill baby boo lets keep it honest
Cause everybody know every king need a queen
Cause everybody know every king need a queen
The radio's locked on
So let's put a little purple in your life tonight
Peel the window off the roof
Put the smoke in the wind
The stars and when I say what I do and I say what I've done
Tell them folks to cut a check likes to get floss on
Baby mama wipe me down my wet back with tissues go to old school
Give you the love you've been missing
Boy I can't wait till you come back home
Give you the love you've been missing
Boy I can't wait till you come back home
To have you all alone
Now I done came a long way
But ain't gone too far
And hope this love letter don't
Cause no one knew the war
Would last us so long
The rockets the red glare
The bombs up in the air
I'm just doing my duty
I'm counting every minute
For sure with you in it
But the soldiers that
This is just as real as it gets
I made some lifelong friends
And girl I can't wait
To get back in your sunshine
Give you the love you've been missing
Boy I can't wait till you come back home
Give you the love you've been missing
Boy I can't wait till you come back home
To have you all alone
My time is spent reflecting
You said I was neglecting
They say you never know
What you have until it's gone
Didn't know back then
But I will from now on
When I try to channel out
All the fear and the stress
Looking dressed to impress
And to know you'll be there
When I'm back from Iraq
And feel good to know
When I'm through with my mission
When I'm through with my mission
Give you the love you've been missing
Boy I can't wait till you come back home
Give you the love you've been missing
Boy I can't wait till you come back home
To have you all alone
She's so yummy yummy yummy
Oh she's sweet as honey
She's so yummy and delicious
Oh with tender kisses
Out with the old girl
I got a boss one on my team
Every playboy mansions dream
She's so yummy yummy yummy
Oh she's sweet as honey
She's so yummy and delicious
Oh with tender kisses
She got a stack full of cakes
And a million dollar waist
When she slid up on my chrome
You as cool as a shade
Getting high as a fire escape
And now I'm ready with a video tape
I guess it was my destiny
To hit that juicy recipe
I get a cavity girl every time
She's so yummy yummy yummy
Oh she's sweet as honey
She's so yummy and delicious
Oh with tender kisses
She's so yummy yummy yummy
Oh she's sweet as honey
She's so yummy and delicious
Oh with tender kisses
Baby after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Things ain't like they use to be baby girl you're losing me
Baby after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Well now the thrill is long gone
And your ring tone song deleted from my phone
And no this ain't about no new company
It's just time for you to do you and me to do me
That we don't belong together no more
And even though the memories still make me wanna believe
The facts I gotta face em
It's over it's history
We gotta breath and I don't wanna deceive
A lie or get it twisted so baby I gotta leave.
Baby after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Things ain't like they use to be baby girl you're losing me
Baby after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Well now I wish there was a way I could turn back the clock
Good to the last drop
And I wish there was a way I could rewind the time
Wait before the tears and the years on the grind
Use to keep it low key now we fight in public
Argue about anything and every single subject
I think you just got a little use to me
Baby after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Things ain't like they use to be baby girl you're losing me
Baby after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Well now I wish there was a way I could turn back the clock
Good to the last drop
And I wish there was a way I could rewind the time
Wait before the tears and the years on the grind
I don't wanna say it but you know what I'm thinking
And we should be apart
Now it's over like a holiday
I don't wanna say it but you know what I'm thinking
And we should be apart
Baby after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Things ain't like they use to be baby girl you're losing me
Baby after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Until you put your body on me
Until you put your body on me
Now the game don't stop when I operate
Tell me where I got the most beautiful women
All in my candy chrome whip
Shoot to the Chi and Hollywood
To boss that body on a ice cold
You never have to walk from nobody
Help you push it up on your body
Make you scream my name
Take that monkey shit off
Face in ya face and we do it like this
I got a whole lot of credit and my pennies is long
I'm leaving with a half breed Mexican and Samoan
Face in ya face and we do it like this
I came to get some money
See that rabbit trick
Got your car on my earlobe
Face in ya face and we do it like this
The look on my face came out a scary movie
Even though the fine girls make you look real good
You could be a square or you could be a thug
Face in ya face and we do it like this
And that's a hater hoe
If you think that's the way to go
And I don't need a goon
To hit you with the doom
Game tight is what I give
I'm on the next flight
And I don't even got a valid driver's license
They hang themselves when they see the Suicide doors
Cause you the baddest bitch I done seen in this club
Paint pretty wet with the butter in her tie
I can do this all night shorty
With game that'll make my toes curl
Bringing daddy money home
She brining me the border back
I can do this all night shorty
Spark a fat ass blunt
Unplug the smoke detector
Get my head off and then eject her
I don't think you understand
I don't pay for pussy when
All about my rubber band
Gotta keep my paper right
The brainwasher up all night
She bought a brand new bike
I don't care she dike
I can do this all night shorty
California face with a down south rump
California face with a down south rump
California face with a down south rump
California face with a down south rump
California face with a down south rump
California face with a down south rump
You know I love it all
I love the way you walk
The way you break me off
You know I love it all
Playboy all about my bunnies
I'm on my humble hustle
You know I love it all
I love the way you walk
The way you break me off
You know I love it all
She send me smiley faces
All the time we spend in Vegas

And she love communication
You know I love it all
I love the way you walk
The way you break me off
You know I love it all
Love the flick she send to me
She be bringing friends to me
You know I love it all
I love the way you walk
The way you break me off
You know I love it all
And I know it don't sound right
And I know it don't sound right
I like to watch her move slow...
She make it move just my speed
Skin tone seems smoother than a water stone
I like to watch her move her body like a rattlesnake
Ass vibrate the room like an earthquake
It must be some purple in the cup
You could really want it
What you know about the great state of Texas
And I'm Draped Up and dripped out
People be trying to bite my flows like Dracula's
Born in the gutter like a little cute baby rat
Prison life turn my cell block into a gym class
Can you understand this or has a G lost touch
It's the Dope House prophet
Smashing down ten with a farm in my woodgrain
I don't know what they told ya
But I'm a beast in the bedroom
I guess I gotta show ya
That I'm a beast in the bedroom
Once I get up in them legs you be coming back for more
That I'm a beast in the bedroom
I don't know what they told ya
But I'm a beast in the bedroom
I guess I gotta show ya
That I'm a beast in the bedroom
Once I get up in them legs you be coming back for more
That I'm a beast in the bedroom
I don't know what they told ya
But I'm a beast in the bedroom
I guess I gotta show ya
That I'm a beast in the bedroom
Once I get up in them legs you be coming back for more
That I'm a beast in the bedroom
And if you think you can hang I'm a try your love
I don't know what they told ya
But I'm a beast in the bedroom
I guess I gotta show ya
That I'm a beast in the bedroom
Once I get up in them legs you be coming back for more
We off the x rated a liter of patron for u
You're the drug I got addicted
This time I'm pleading guilty
I lose the sense of gravity
When you start moving on me
We're on the same orbit
I was poisoned You're the remedy
When you're kissing over me
I'm a ride you like I ride that wave let me keep you hotter then a microwave.
You're the drug I got addicted

When you start moving on me
You know that I love it
When you're kissing over me
With my momma up in heaven
Father and the reverend
I hope I don't violate
All my nephews and my nieces
I hope I don't violate
Two times for my G's that never come back
I hope you understand me
And jump real deep in the game
It's so hard to take it
A way up out the ghetto
Make me go crazy when she come around
Not a top notch top rank or top flight
Her body so Cleo colder then Alaska
Break me off slow she gone break me off fast
And you know she broke me off from the south to the north
Make me go crazy when she come around
Make me go crazy when she come around
If you're sexy and you know it and you're not afraid to show it
Make me go crazy when she come around
Tell me she's make believe
Got a body you can have

Living way lavish on fancy things

Tell me she's make believe
Got a body you can have

She's like a real life
She a fantasy fantasy
She a fantasy fantasy girl
She's like a real life

Welcome everybody to my fantasia
My freak in a sheets my diamond diva
A fairy tale a piece of fiction

South Park from the heart jump start
The game everybody in my hood selling
Fucked all your nieces I eaten up for breakfast
They taste so delicious smoke fill rooms popping mushrooms
You should join us a million haters and they still can't destroy us
Dearly departed and those who god guarded
The young and the lost is who I'm trying to target
The Sergeant's narcotic's division is crocked
You can act like you can't hear me
I know your listening
I hear you talking out the pot that your pissing in
Street specialist respect my intelligence
20 ounce Mountain Dew mix it with a 2
With my nephew smoking Pepe Le Pew
Talking about a dude we don't think is groovy
I'm gonna put him to bed like Sleeping Beauty
I told you once and I'll tell ya twice
But I'm not gonna say this three or four times
You boys want to play we don't runaway
Got damn I forgot what I was going to say
Slice your throat just like a goat
You boys can't see me with a microscope
Kick down your door and found your Snow
After I jack all the birds in the kitchen
Crack hotels digital scales
I bought 2 clubs and a fucking restaurant
Take a journey where the boys die early
Turn the table buck shot be fatal
Pigs hand cuffing my wrist to my ankle
I get my dick sucked by my new receptionist
I started out with 100 tapes
If you wasn't down then get the fuck out my face
Oh baby baby I'm crazy for you.
Cause Baby I love you.
I don't think you love me.
I still love you after we broke up.
Oh baby baby I'm crazy for you.
You didn't know that I'd be there.
Cause baby I love you.
I don't think you love me.
I still love you after we broke up.
Telling you I miss you
When I just wanna kiss you
Something I ain't hip to
See you got me all alone
Waiting right here by the phone
Just to hear your voice tone
If this was even meant to be
Is it cause you on your grind
Cause you always on my mind
If everything you said was true
If you were really coming through
And my girlfriends keep telling me
And my girlfriends keep telling me
Telling you I miss you
When I just wanna kiss you
Something I ain't hip to
I'm out with my girls
But it gets hard sometimes
Cause there ain't no one just like you
I try my best but I can't shake this
Spell you got me through
All I can picture is the color of your eyes
And the way you make me smile
I ain't felt this in a while
But I came to the conclusion
That this is an illusion
The way I feel about myself
If I'm just chasing a fantasy
Telling you I miss you
When I just wanna kiss you
Something I ain't hip to
Just leave your name and number
Just leave your name and number
Just leave your name and number
Just leave your name and number
Losing track of the people
Don't take this the wrong way
And my girlfriends keep telling me
And my girlfriends keep telling me
Telling you I miss you
When I just wanna kiss you
Something I ain't hip to
And dedicate it to my favorite lover
There's thoughts in my head
Over and over and over and over again
Over and over and over and over again
To don't know what's on my mind
And dedicate it to my favorite lover
Rain and shine sleet and snow
Couldn't stop the way we flow
Welcome to my miracle
And I'm digging on your lyrical
Your melody is my remedy
Squeeze to my Hennessey
The one to call when I'm sipping for
With the candy coated Tennessee
And let's make it a fish with your boy Baby Bash with some heavenly bliss
And dedicate it to my favorite lover
I fell in love when I met you
I love the way you make me feel
Can't do without your energy
And dedicate it to my favorite lover
Ha ah ha you know we did it I ain't used to this loving Girl you make me wanna love somebody yeah

Any time any place I Adore you and I like to see your face
When I settle in middle when you miss me just a little
Boy you know you can always call on me
You know I'm on the grind so I can't stay very long
Every time I hear the radio it's like every song
Make me think of you and me getting our Merry on
Like a cherry on top of cake and ice cream
I'm on some late night hype so I might not make it home
I'm in the mood your gratitude baby grab the phone
Just Call on me when you need it

When I settle in middle when you miss me just a little
Boy you know you can always call on me
Play like a piano when I'm flipping through the
Married to Marijuana with that drama you can miss me
Blaze the bitch up now she's a bread winner
I remember way back in the day
I used to get spankings from my momma
Little mommas say I'm a sex symbol
Little Christian on a mission
But listen he gaining recognition
The lucky motherfucker outside of the Yukon
Representing of the way Houston
These boys ain't ready for the age of Levy in a SS
And I'm counting green
I promise this song is harder than my dick is
I won in the Olympics for cooking the most chickens
Brain deader than a door knob
The one to put a dope house
I'm sorry but it won't stop
My door got kicked in once before
I put holes up in they asses
Let's make these girls get wild
She get a round of applause
She's ready no time to stop
I go hard for the money
I go hard for you honey
I ain't here to make love
Now tell the whole gang
You already know I like it nice and sweaty
So work that thing but don't hurt that thing
Shake that thing but don't break that thing
You already know that I'm so crazy
Gotta dime on deck with a ace in the hole
And yo butt is so thick like my cash flow
And yo ex boyfriend is an asshole
Let's make a movie or a video
Let's make a movie or a video
With game that'll make my toes curl
California face with a down south rump
California face with a down south rump
California face with a down south rump
California face with a down south rump
California face with a down south rump
California face with a down south rump
It's time to do you all in
Country to country I live in hotels
Step out my balcony and check out my view
Lucky look cleaner then Andre Monk
Open up my closet and you in the Galleria
I'm the shit homeboy call me Lucky Diarrhea
I practice Karate like the boy Chuck Norris
I'm still Ralph Lauren and I'm still Mike Jordan
Got all white pit like Angelina Jolie
Might make you think that you got chicken pox
Said he gotta be right back before the lights is on
Just to let you know how cold them batches be
Sell dog shit to ya uncles and ya cousins
And that's the really really realest shit I ever spoken
I seen it in her face that the broad was a cut throat
And break bread with the click and roll the fancy whips
Is see you shake it fast...
I want to know her name...
Looking so famous she's training in hot rock
Y'all might be staring and glaring but baby ain't even glancing
And then let me tongue her
Young and dumb with real good brains
Smoke weed and get more hungry than a hostage
I've been hard since the very first demo
I don't think they want no damn trouble
Man these fools don't want to see me
If you don't want to give me no love
That bitch is hot like Houston summer
Some people call us Dumb and Dumber
I'll come to your house for damn supper
And I know that she be feeling me
She love to watch me in the mirror when I'm doing my stabbing
Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice
Love to see me get the lap dance every now and then huh
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh
She ain't having that cause ain't another like papa
And her parents just don't understand
But she don't give a damn
One day we gone get it together
One day we gone keep it together
One day we gone keep it together
One day we gone keep it together
You see I smash on you pussies and creep with the thugs
I got a tight spot that sits by the sea
I have nightmares and I wake up laughing
And still didn't even pay my warrants
I just sat up in jail and ate my porridge
I need some Purity so I screwed it and chopped it
I can't stop smoking cause no one like a quitter
Every three months my house would get raided
Throw your guns up in the sky for me
International players on the microphone
But still I put it up like I'm posed to
Squares never recognized they my birthday had
Telly shots of Tequila
But you just won't admit it
From the moment I inner
That's my motto in the fast lane
Drinking champaign out the bottle
With the fine little sexy mama
I know you got a man but this is what you should say
You found somebody who does it better than he can
Have me singing all night like like
You found somebody who does it better than he can
Have me singing all night like like
Just tell him to the left left left
Girl you deserve nothing but the best
Girl you need to tell him
You found somebody who does it better than he can
Have me singing all night like like like
She's so yummy yummy yummy
Oh she's sweet as honey
She's so yummy and delicious
Ooh her tender kisses
Out with the old girl
And girl I got the munchies
Cinnamon spice up in my life
I got a boss one on my team
Every playboy mansions dream
And she thicker than the sticker
She got a stock full of cakes
And a million dollar waste
When she slid up on my chrome
She said its true runny ray
You as cool as a shade
And now I'm ready with a video tape
I get it was my destiny
To hit that juicy recipe
Carmel coated ecstasy
Got a cavity girl all the time
Nouveau nouveau nouveau
Nouveau nouveau nouveau
Nouveau nouveau nouveau
Nouveau nouveau nouveau
And my heart is feeling lonely
Just thinking bout my baby got me twisted in my be
And I don't know how to take
But its driving me so crazy
And I still can't sleep
I'm feeling hopeless at home I don't know what to do I think I'm in love Baby...
Its just an illusion that I have in my heart
I don't know what to do I'm going out of my mind
So baby if you let me get
We could do this all night now I don't care if you got a man
Baby I wish you'd understand
And I still can't sleep
I'm feeling hopeless at home I don't know what to do I think I'm in love Baby...
Its just an illusion that I have in my heart
I love the way you freak it like that
I love the way you freak it like that
I love the way you freak it like that
Got your boy feel less supreme
Hold up wait a minute baby you so damn independent
Loving everything your representing
And that's what's up and I don't care what people scream
I'm gonna keep it saucy
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart
So I threw on my drawers
Candy coat on my whip
And now we gone with the wind
She make you go crazy when she out on the on floor
They played some Lil Wayne
They mashed a Journey record
She make you go crazy when she out on the on floor
She make you go crazy when she out on the on floor
And I'm glad that she love to have me
From Jamaica to Puerto Rico down to Utah
Haters tell me they can't be mad at my new job
Give it to ya girl don't have to tell you baby
You start if you like it you know I love it
We can fly away or just drive
Said I met a lot of ladies and I travel the world
I said man girl you think it's 5 o'clock traffic on that 101
Maybe later on tonight me and you can have ourselves a 1 on 1
I swear I've seen you somewhere else
Maybe it was on a movie screen
Maybe it was on a television
Or on the cover of a magazine
I know and I don't care
Let me see your underwear
Let me see how thick you is baby
Let me see what's under there
Everybody know we go go go go oh so fast when I'm on my grind
But I can't lie when I see that ass
I slow it down and take my time
Said I met a lot of ladies and I travel the world
Girl I gotta go I gotta do another interview
Studio tonight have a banger you could listen to
Baby you ain't even gotta ask
Said I met a lot of ladies and I travel the world
All you need to know is you've got a friend
If I'm troubled I know I can depend
Baby let's cruise with the radio tunes
You know the best times come when there's nothing to do
It's rare that a player get a minute or two
So I cherish every second with a girl like you
Ain't nothing like a home girl down for the ride
Nothing like a home girl down for life
When I'm out of state I know you'll rep me
Ain't no other woman will accept me
A man's only true as his options
Damn it feels good to know I've got a friend
We've been living life right till the end
If I'm troubled I know I can depend
I want you to know when you need a friend
I'm definitely a friend you can depend on
Like my name was Smokey
So when things don't seem to be going your way
And nothing seems to be going right
I want to be the man that'll brighten your day
And turn your darkness to light
Because you've been a good woman to me
You deserve the best and nothing less
So the best is what you get and all my respect
All the way till the end
Baby doll you've got yourself a friend
All you need to know is you've got a friend
We've been living life right till the end
If I'm troubled I know I can depend
I'll always be your player partner
Matter of fact that's all I feel with some gratitude
I just appreciate the time that I have with you
Now I'm in and out your life like a robbery
Got me on the road till I'm getting paid properly
And I can feel that you still so proud of me
So little mama I'm a always be your handyman
All you need to know is you've got a friend
We've been living life right till the end
If I'm troubled I know I can depend
All you need to know is you've got a friend

If I'm troubled I know I can depend

I don't care about another man's money
Cause Baby Boy he got his own damn money
The way I'm iced out I know you hate this boy
God blessed me with a talent now it's time to show off
6 years in the game now it's time to go off
If you don't hustle hard then you dog with no claws
Look I don't care about another man's money
Cause finally I got my own damn money
I done made it to the start and now I gotta finish
And I'm still from the block but don't call me Jenny
I'm stuck on my money like a pimp with his cane
Hardness on the track
They don't know how you make me feel
And they don't know what you do to me
So I shot down everything and I gotta let you know
This industry shit hard and it ain't no joke
Ill crack up if she leave me for another man
I just gotta let you know how you really make me feel
They don't know how you make me feel
And they don't know what you do to me
I be happy every time I hug my girl
I be happy every time I rub my girl
If I didn't do this shit this wouldn't be the way I live
I'm grateful everyday that you're mine
They don't know how you make me feel
And they don't know what you do to me
They don't know how you make me feel
And they don't know what you do to me
From the day that I saw you
I knew that we would pursue
Looking back on a year
Although we've had our
We've still pulled through
I wanna lace you with
Diamonds and every ring
Give you everything you
Cause you can tell me
I keep it real with you
I'll keep on loving you
I feel your whole aura
And I can't wait to hook up
My love for you will never end
You'll always be a part of me
As long as time keeps
You'll always be my baby boy.
I took my time to put
I must admit it was so hard to do
And every minute that I
You make me believe I
Have nothing to lose and
Deep down I always knew
That you would be mine
Do you believe in destiny
Because I got a funny feeling
I need you next to me
Preferably in the house full
Of luxuries and little kids
Knew you was gonna be one
Cause my heart spoke for the
Very first time in a long while
You're the only one who
Sweeps me off my feet
Makes my soul go weak
The only one who makes
I could never live without you
You know that what I feel
That I looked into your eyes
When you're not by my side
I never knew a love like
A vision so picture perfect
It could never be wrong
See you belong with Jay
I might have to marry you
We just need to feel the same
We just need to feel the same
This is the way I live
This is the way I live
This is the way I live
Six months later now we're big dog status

Throw ya hands and ya hood up
Fiend a every fuck ass hoe
So now I travel everywhere with mack mack mack
I'm getting sick of the game
Just handle my business man
Where the fuck is the money
My Pastor told me forever represent for my team
Fire the pump like a cheetah
Ask yo girl did I beat her when I skeet her
Label me a Georgia boy
We too deep in dis shit
And ride hundred 4 deep
So back up off me in this place
Because you I want it
Come give me a hug baby
Ya see me on some dubs
I know you wanna cut me up baby
Ya see me on some dubs
I know you wanna cut me up
I see in yo eyes you wants to lay me
But later we can get crazy
To those that wanna hear em
Straight from the real
Flip flop changing colors
I thought I told ya I'd be back
To flip from ride Lacs
Colors on gold Regals
And make the whole world jump
Now watch how the crowd scream
Major make be the click that spit
I'm about to get them dollars
Swerving candy red show stopper
Kemp balling in the SS impala
20 inch dubs balling in the club
I'm a pimp a whore when you see me
Come and greet me Baby D beep me
Now how you talk fresh shorty seven days a week
Go to the club and get in free
She started bouncing that ass then come ride with me
Fresh from the barber shop temp fade
Money hoes and clothes with five g's to show
Swerving in a sky blue candy painted suburban
Straight getting to it they ask me how you do it baby
It's in my nature lady
600 for an ounce of that Saddam Hussein
I grabbed it on a plane down to pick me up
Jumping out the Lexus truck
Signed a few autographs
Damn it feels good to be home
Ain't nothing like riding on dubs and chrome
She was looking so good when I saw her in the mall
Hair done nails done and all
Slip and slide with me
Baby tell me what's really on your mind
Anytime of the day is the right time
We'll be creeping in the middle of the night
Baby girl if the mood's right
Sipping wine by the candle light
I bet you never had a lover like me
Get you in between the sheets
Feel the heat as I kiss you from your head to your feet
Baby can you swing my way
Baby can we sweat this one more again
Why can't you be faithful to me
Slow grinding on the mattress
Had an action for passion
Because I'm long lasting
See I wanna hit it quit it
And I really didn't understand
By the way she turn boys to men
She had me wanting to do it again
And again and again and again
Where the phone let's bone
Keep it going all soft
I just come to break you off
What you want what you need
Come with me and freak your fantasy
Huh so what you really know bout my side
You know they all know me
From Zone 1 to Zone 3
I represent the dirty dirty south
Make your shoulder jump
Wear your chrome and wear your vest
Had your home a bloody mess
Faked thugs get bless with a slug to the chest
These are the places that I be
These are the faces that I see
I die for the city don't play by me
Death before dishonor put that on my mama
The six I use to drive was live but under rated
The brown one with the three rims
When we jump up in the club it feel like the earth quaking
I suppose I'm colder then H 2 O froze
When I hit the door you better hit the floor
Please believe by all means we party rockers
When we hit the stage and the music plays the club start rocking
You give me one verse with ten bars and watch how I rock this
Throw ya motherfucking middle finger up
If ya don't give a fuck
They bring back my money
Twenty east to Decatur
Do you wanna make love

Die for the cheddar I carry that llama
Stack it in the winter so I shine this summer
I come like self bring a little back
At least spend ten so I can get a good pack
Haters can't stop me I'm on my shit
Put your knot in the air if you're a money go getter
Me if you about that paper
Make it rain hundreds
Monday through Sunday
Take it from the rainbow straight to the pot
Made them a promise we'll never ever flop
Came from the bottom straight to the top
While he out he take my spot
I wonder how long you can keep them on you
Straight to the bank I'm counting my money
And if you don't know how then watch her do it
And if you don't know how then watch her do it
That's right girl go whip that cake
In other words make ya ass shake
First ya bounce then ya lean then snap ya fingers
Ya hips ya thigh ya whole demeanor
We gone off patron and here come another round
And if you don't know how then watch her do it
And if you don't know how then watch her do it
Can you move ya body like a vibrator
Wiggle ya big brown ass like a jaw breaker
See like Buffy you were lucky to have a back like that
See like my razor phone ma stomach flat like that
Around her navel is a tat
Watch her do a dance and ya see how they back up
And if you don't know how then watch her Act Up
Break it down turn around for a couple stacks what
And if you don't know how then watch her do it
And if you don't know how then watch her do it
A bounce stop then lean
A bounce stop then lean
A bounce stop then lean
If you don't know how then watch her do it
Now you can catch me in a black tee iced up
See I don't give a fuck
Don't get it twisted by the rap homes
Stay in the streets with bricks get my grind on
I'm on as concrete the nightmare on yo street
You know the name you hear the slang
Yeah I'm for real hoe
So Paul will work them all y'all to the east side
Last but not least it's the Pastor y'all
Always been ready to ball
Hit the O wit big blunts of herbs
For ever damn the real rep the real
Now when this beat drop...
You gotta be on point. so bring it back.
Big on bitch. bring it back
We gonna act a damn clown
Sip Champagne in the VIP is just a part of the game
But who's to blame when the clubs getting buck ass wild
It's them boys from the A throwing bows in the crowd
If you don't know by now it's about to go down
Don't make me go out in silence
Talking when we just resort to violence
Only hell can save em
Living this life it has to go down
I am getting down to get loot
I ain't got no reason to lie
Now its head of the season when I see you we ride
We ain't gonna even reply
So you're saying you want to get physical
So catch enough from this bitch boy I'm sick of you
We're right to your jaw
So what the fuck it is tight

When I give the command
Leave his body in his shoes
Yo it's personal to me

And if you don't know how then watch her do it
And if you don't know how then watch her do it
That's right girl go whip that cake
In other words make ya ass shake

But since I got that under control
So I picked up the phone and called Rico
I told him I'd be at the rink for sure
That me and you like to bounce to
Got the skate police always on patrol
No time to laugh when somebody falls
Now it's 10 o'clock and the music stops
And it comes back on with a slow song
So I chose the one that I knew could roll
I'm on my second wind and I done caught my breath
So I can find that girl and all her friends
So we can hook next week and come do it again
But I learned how to skate in the Golden State
I was just going to tell you now
Even though your friends know I got the hots for you
I know you got boyfriend I'm not knocking yo
But when we do hang you always try to give me the rhyme
We used to talk on the phone a lot
I was working on my album that was why I wasn't home a lot
But you never understood when I told you that
It's a shame that me and you had to go threw that
I'm knowing that you probably have guilty continence
Forget it we can start all over again
I'm mature now and a little older than him
If you wanna be down with me
Oh girl what's it gonna be
We could go to Six Flags on a Saturday
Transportation come on that's a minor lick
Let him know we ain't gonna ride the bus
I'm a win stuffed animals just for you
I'm a ride that ride just for you
I'm a buy cotton candy just for you
Theirs so many things for us to do
We can take a lot if pictures while we there
Just say the word girl and I'll be there
It's not a card game that I'm dealing you
Well it's back to reality the point of it all
If you going to stay with him what's the point of it all
I got money and my album to think about
But on the real girl you might wanna think it out
And I would hate to get the word that you got around
And if we never hook up and he still with you
Illegal Life Records Baby
Break it down for the part of rock...
Fell that boom bang beat shining down on are dancing feet
See that star in the sky
We've got a doggone beat now
We gonna call our very own
Nassau rock and Nassau roll
And we've got a doggone beat now
We gonna take care of business too
You know my heart is still in the Caribbean
I still hear my girlfriend say
And the sailing boats beneath the bridge so high
I feel the sun and my heart within me leaving
I hear cowbells and the drums on New Years morning
And I smell hibiscus in the tropic skies above
I know it's Nassau and everything about it I love
But your heart is in the Caribbean
You can hear them say
To the land of the sun and the palmy beaches
Where your heart belongs
Cannot get it in America
At the Medical Center what you think
The doctor said you'll have to drink.
And go back to the West Indies.
Cannot get it in America
I want to do the thing that I shouldn't
But when I tried I found that I couldn't
Many nights I sit here
With memories by the score
Thinking of the days I've spent
With the girl I still adore
So I'm going back to see her
Before all my days are done
Going back to see her
In the land of the sea and sun
About this Nassau girl
Put my thoughts in motion
And found my heart in a whirl
So I'm going back to see her
Before my days are gone
Going back to see her
In the land of the sea and sun
Ever since I've left her
Nothing has been the same
I think I'll pull up anchor
I'm going back to give her my name
Oh so many nights I sit here
With memories by the score
Thinking of the days I've spent
With the girl I still adore
Yes I'm going back to see her
Before my days are done
Going back to see her
We get it almost every night
And when that moon gets big and bright
It's a super natural delight
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
They don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose
They keep things right
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
Dancing in the moonlight
Feeling warm and right
It's such a warm and natural sight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight
We like our fun and never fight
We can dance and stay on top
It's a super natural delight
Dancing in the moonlight
Everybody's feeling warm and right
It's such a warm and natural sight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight
They don't don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose

Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
Dancing in the moonlight
Feeling warm and right
It's such a warm and natural sight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight
We get it almost every night
And when that moon gets big and bright

Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
They don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose

Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
Dancing in the moonlight

I fell in love with you
Was such a special night
You lay right by my side
And I told you things I never told a soul
And now that I have you babe
I promise I'll never leave
I don't know what to do
A love that never ends
You're more than just a friend
And my heart and soul I'll always give to you
Someday you'll be my wife
And I'll be with you until the end of time
I promise I'll never leave
I don't know what to do
It doesn't matter what you say or do
Let's me know you're crazy over me
And I'm crazy over you
That you'll come back to me
You gonna run away and hide
I'm gonna run right by your side
For you pretty baby I'll even die
That you'll come back to me
That you'll come back to me
You're gonna sit right down and cry
All you gonna do is dry your eye
Go Back to the Island Boy
Going back to the island
I say don't worry mama don't cry
I sure hope that she's still able
Sow the seed around 5 o'clock
I'll stand at her bow and see the dark
Out in the field from dawn till dusk
Swimming in the blue hole is a must
That island where I was born
First thing I'll do is grow some corn
Going back to the island
I say don't worry mama don't cry
I've been Cooking outside in the island pot
So young when I learn I haven't forgotten
Saturday night we gonna dance and sway
People don't you understand
Live like a king and be a happy man
Going back to the island
I say don't worry mama don't cry
Going back to the island
I say don't worry mama don't cry
I got to go back to the island
I got to go back to the island
I got to go back to the island
Going back to the island
I say don't worry mama don't cry
That's the way I like it
That's the way I like it
When you give me all your love
And do it the very best you can
Your way to beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal suicidal when you say it's over
Dam all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal
When they say it's over
You get two for the price of one
It took me a long time to find a good woman
One that would be true
That's why I'm gonna double
What it takes baby to hold on to you
As good as it was before
I'm gonna love you so good
You'll be begging and crying for more
And you're gonna receive double pleasure every time I do
You feel so good inside
You're gonna be satisfied
I've been dying to use on you
Don't be afraid to give me your love
You make the first step baby
And the rest I can easily do
You get two for the price of one
That's where you wanna go
To get away from it all
Tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
And we'll perfect our chemistry
That dreamy look in your eye
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
Now if you wanna go and get away from it all
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
I see the dance people had a ball
Get back you flea infested mongrel
You put a woman in front and her man behind
I heard a woman shout out
I see the dance people had a ball
Get back you flea infested mongrel
If you want some take some go out and get it
Gotta show her you the mac of the game or just forget it
I was up with the moon
And down with the stars
Watch me go down there and do my talk
Tell me would it be okay if I say
Baby don't turn me away
And only she could light my fuse
Desperate men make desperate moves
Please please give me a chance of romance just for two
Till I opened my eyes and to my surprise
But you gotta give all you got to get me
If not yo I got other guys that wanna see me
Hun let me show you how its done
You gotta have balls or you ain't gonna get none
Let me see you wine it down for me
Come on girl let's get wet
You know this party's getting hotter
I wanna let my hair down

You know this party's getting hotter
I've been waiting all year for the summer
Hanging out at one beach or another
All the trees start to sway to the music
And the breeze starts caressing your hair.
Summer love makes my heart
Sing and jump in the air.
The days are getting longer
And the moon stays up all night.
Everybody sing la la la la la la la la la la la la.
Your face must shine like rays from the sun.
Then I'll know you're the one
And the summer's begun.
The days are getting longer
And the moon stays out all night.
And everybody is going to sing la la la la la la la la la la la la.
Come on everybody la la la la la la la la la la la la.
Summer love is all around the world.
Summer love is all around the world.
Summer love is all around the world.
I want to whip it and we're down to the over.
I may want you to turn it around now.
You and me that's how it's going to be now.
And you can be mine so bring it down to me
The nights are getting longer
And the stars stay out all night.
Everybody going to be all right
In the summer of love.
Everybody is going to sing la la la la la la la la la la la la.
Oh whoa la la la la la la la la la la la la.
Keep singing la la la la la la la la la la la la.

When your down and out
When the road you walk
And the tears you cry
Start to sink too much
Gotta set your sights
Everyday is a brand new start
You can take the prize
If hope is in your eyes
When the times get tough
And you can't breathe free
And the friends you made don't return the calls
And pretend you don't exist
Everyday is a brand new start
You can take the prize
If hope is in your eyes
You'll be sure to catch the moon
All your dreams are possible
Everyday is a brand new start
You can take the prize
If hope is in your eyes
You'd never leave our happy home.
And everything was cool.
And maybe you can just tell me
And make you come back it me.
All the joy that you have brought to me
And make you come back to me.
Didn't realize I pushed you away.
And the girls report to the call
The poor dog show down
She really want to skip town
Get back you flea infested monger
Her bone runs out now
What could you be friend
Me and My white short shorts

Your lips are sweet as candy
The taste stays on my mind
You just keep me thirsty
For another cup of wine
In your arms so tight
I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me
But I don't need a cure
I'll just stay addicted
And hope I can endure
I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me
In your arms so tight
I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me
I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me
I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me
If you want some take some go out and get it

And down with the stars
Watch me go down there and do my talk
Tell me would it be okay if I say

Desperate men make desperate moves

Well I'm just a normal guy in a normal world
I live a normal life. I got a normal girl
I drive to normal places in my normal car
I even wish upon the normal stars
But people say it isn't normal
If I want to pierce my nose
Or if I let a blind man design my clothes
Or if I pick the petals leave the thorns upon my rose
Or if I just want to paint my toes
My friends say it isn't normal if I don't want to touch that stuff
And if you don't like it that's tough.
Once upon a time there was a man who had a wife
And I want to be an actor and a sculptor
Maybe I wanna drive a tractor
So what if you don't like to dance to my beat
So what if you're expensive and you think I'm cheap
So what if I don't want to come my hair
And I bet you he thinks I'm normal
Every individual has their own skill
We all set goals that we want to fulfill
It's your life so do what you wanna do
And that's gonna make you normal
I want to do what I do
I want to do what I do Everybody's normal
Heaven has already granted me my wish
Still I never thought it would be as pleasant as this
Though you have no wings like the angels up above
You have a heavenly smile and also the gift of love
I promise to love you in everything I do
And know that you love me to
For sending you here to fill my loneliness
And to fill my lonely heart with love
And I am going to get down on my knees everyday
For what he sent to me today
I promise to love you in everything I do
And know that you love me to
For sending you here to fill my loneliness
And to fill my lonely heart with love
Said I am going to get down on my knees
I am going to thank him for what he sent to me
When you look in my eyes
My heart skips a beat there
I look into your eyes
Best years of our lives
I could hardly believe
The things that would happen
So let's stay together
Oh girl I'm so thankful
That you are still mine
I look into your eyes
Best years of our lives
My world's a better place
I'll be right by your side
I look into your eyes
Best years of our lives
I helped you keep my shine on
A perky little something
Let's just rewind the song
The rest years the best years
I look into your eyes
Best years of our lives
I look into your eyes
It doesn't matter where we go as long as I'm with you
Loving and holding you close
Let's fly away to paradise
I'll help you understand oh
You know a holiday is coming we can break away
And if it's you and me together we can save the day
You know a holiday is coming we can break away
And if it's you and me together we can save the day
Our tomorrows and our yesterdays are passing by
And you know the time has finally come
For us to get away from everything that brings us down
See baby it's time to have some fun
I'll help you understand oh
You know a holiday is coming we can break away
And if it's you and me together we can save the day
You know a holiday is coming we can break away

You know a holiday is coming we can break away
And if it's you and me together we can save the day
You know a holiday is coming we can break away
And if it's you and me together we can save the day
You know a holiday is coming we can break away
And if it's you and me together we can save the day
I said I'm rich in love
Financially I'm a pauper
I'm not the man for you if it's money you're after
I'm not the man for you if it's money you're after
The best that I can buy for you is something cool to drink
You say you want gold chains and Gucci links
You say what can I do for you but what can you do for me
You want me pay for your things but you want mine free
Don't want an empty pocket man

But right now it's pure echo in your pockets
Girl if it's money you are after please stop it
You see I'm out of your league so just drop it.
I know my loving can't bring you riches on the stock market
You're loving can't even fill up my grocery basket
And I'm sure that your loving can't pay my rent
But my loving is free girl it don't cost a cent
He wants me for his queen
He's built a throne for me

I remember when I was young
Me and dad had so much fun
Climbing trees and skipping stones
I had a couple of lizards
But the biggest kick I've ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were playing on the dock
And how your feet just can't keep still
I'm always catching them every time
And I guess I always will
Plan on rocking was the way to put things right
Me and Terri by my side
Taking salties for a ride
Up the river to be safe and sound
That he won't be found
That's the way my dad taught me
And how your feet just can't keep still
I'm always catching them every time
And I guess I always will
Ruff to my left Ruff to my right
You snacks shag in the house
Light on my paws some jaws
If you want some take some go out and get it
Gotta show her you the mac of the game or just forget it
I was up with the moon
And down with the stars
Watch me go down there and do my talk
Tell me would it be okay if I say
Baby don't turn me away
And only she could light my fuse
Desperate men make desperate moves
Please please give me a chance of romance just for two
Till I opened my eyes and to my surprise
But you gotta give all you got to get me

Hun let me show you how its done
You gotta have balls or you ain't gonna get none
Whose favorite book has all the animals you can wish
Welcome to Stanley's world
Come help him figure out
What life is all about
No problem Stan can't solve
With a friend like you
With a friend like you
Coach said to fake right
Watch out for the pick
Gotta run the give and go
And take the ball to the hole
To shoot the outside J
Just keep ya head in the game
Just keep ya head in the game
To shoot the outside J
Just keep ya head in the game
That we get the rebound
Then the crowd will go wild
We'll hit the right notes
It's not the time or place
Get my head in the game
Get my head in the game
Why am I feeling so wrong
My head's in the game
But my heart's in the song
She makes this feel so right
Well I wake up in the morning each and every day
And I sit down at the table and I hear my daddy say
Life is nothing but a slap in the face
Life is nothing but a fat rat race
Every night I have a dream that you're taking off your dress
The only thing you're wearing is a button on your chest
Life is nothing but a slap in the face
Life is nothing but a fat rat race
It's a jungle out there and I know I don't belong
So all night long I just sing my stupid song
Life is nothing but a slap in the face
Life is nothing but a fat rat race
Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do
Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do
Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do
When your down and out
When the road you walk
And the tears you cry
Start to sink too much
Gotta set your sights
Everyday is a brand new start
You can take the prize
If hope is in your eyes
When the times get tough
And you can't breathe free
And the friends you made don't return the calls
And pretend you don't exist
Everyday is a brand new start
You can take the prize
If hope is in your eyes
You'll be sure to catch the moon
All your dreams are possible
Everyday is a brand new start
You can take the prize
If hope is in your eyes
Hey ho what's good with you now
Rock the house get you up on your feet
Get away from the rat race
We're gonna raise the roof
Let the music do it's thing to you
Drop the top and dance all night
Life is good so let me
What's good with you now
You know what to do now
Roll your booty round from left to right
The way you take a go
Now baby work it girl

Life is good so let me
You know what to do now

Hitting all the spots while the sun still shining

Give me some of your time girls
You keep the party going on all over the world

Give me some of your time girls
You keep the party going on all over the world
And I keep missing out
Take me with ya my girls
Give me some of your time girls
You keep the party going on all over the world
And I keep missing out
When I was a cool young one
Accepting without question the prevailing views
That a young man's life was one long grind
What a wonderful phrase
Ain't no passing craze
For the rest of your days
It's our problem free
When I was a shallow youth
Cool calm reflection I was never that good
I was a pawn in the game I saw no trees for the wood
My future stretched behind me I was over the hill
I put my best foot forward while the other one stood still
For the rest of your days
It's our problem free
I hoped we have conveyed
It's much cooler in the shade
Some say it's just a waste of time
But they don't realize
That the view is nothing but a crime
We're all creatures world wise
It's our problem free
Ain't no passing craze
For the rest of your days
It's our problem free
Ain't no passing craze
It's a world of hope and a world of fears.
That it's time we're aware
It's a small world after all.
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
And a smile means friendship to everyone.
Though the mountains be wide.
And the oceans are wide.
It's a small world after all.
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
No matter if you're big or small
It's a world of hope and a world of fears
There's so much that we share
That it's time we're aware
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
All you boys and girls sing along
There's no place I'd rather be
Than on my jet ski out at sea
Lingering in the ocean blue
And if I had one wish come true
I'd surf till the sunset
Everyone come ride the wave now
Everyone come ride the wave now
There's no place I'd rather be
Than on the seashore right we're free
The golden sand is where I live
And if I only had my way
I'd play till the sunset beyond the horizon
Catch a crew. come ride the wave now
Everyone come ride the wave now
Time to try the Bahamas roller coaster ride
Now everybody now ride the wave
Everybody say wipe out
There's no place id rather be
Than on my jet ski out at sea
Lingering in the ocean blue
And if I had one wish come true
I'd surf till the sunset beyond the horizon
Catch a crew come rid the wave now
Everyone come ride the wave now
You know that's how we do
Get away from the rat race
Let the music do it's thing to you
Play ahead and get it started
Come on now take you for a ride
Drop the top and dance all night
Life is good so let me hear you holler
That's exactly how we do
Bringing the party to you
Life is good so let me hear you holler
Ride your groove and let it out
Let me hear you holler
You don't have to bring a dollar
Come on up and do your thing
If you want to jump and dance
I was at home playing DJ
Jumped on the beat and flew away
Our party was moving out of control
I move to a rhythm I don't know
Make that woman dance
Make that woman dance
She makes me forget what world I'm on
Make that woman dance
Make that woman dance
And I see you on the dance floor and you tell me
Why don't you come and stomp your feet along with me
Make that woman dance
And we gonna kick it like this
Lets move it all night
Gonna take you back to the old school
Lets dance to the rhythm
And let me see your wide waist line
And the electric slide
Doing the running man
Or walk the feeling out if you can
Everybody rocks to the beat
And everybody runs together
I didn't know what to say
So I would ask my mother
To go outside and play
I thought she didn't love me
So I got me stuff and fled
Now I wonder if it was the right thing to do
Since I have fallen and hit my head
And now that I'm away from home
When I was young I wanted to be famous
I think that this is all a sham
For whatever they want you to believe
So believe everything stars say
They are just influencing you to do what they think is right
Witch really isn't right to begin with
So I am going to tell you
Not to believe everything happiness says
Nothing feels better then running from fears
I thought she didn't love me
So I got me stuff and fled
Now I wonder if it was the right thing to do
Since I have fallen and hit my head
And now that I'm away from home
So now that I have told you what I think
I hope that you take it to heart
My mother never answered or talked to me much
So then I started to get this big hunch
That she didn't want me near her
Even though she said I was dear to her
And the stars tell you to live your own life
And be who you want to be
But nothing really turns out the way you want it
Unless you believe in yourself
I thought she didn't love me
So I got me stuff and fled
Now I wonder if it was the right thing to do
Since I have fallen and hit my head
And now that I'm away from home
I thought she didn't love me
So I got me stuff and fled
Now I wonder if it was the right thing to do
Since I have fallen and hit my head
And now that I'm away from home
I thought she didn't love me
So I got me stuff and fled
Now I wonder if it was the right thing to do
Since I have fallen and hit my head
And now that I'm away from home
They make me ill I know I feel you
That's why we got to stick together
Got me lit like a candlestick Get too hot when you touch the tip
You got me going again Baby you got me going again You make sick
We was on our way home on the freeway
He told me that he wanna go home With me up on the hill to my condo
But I told him go I don't really know though
He got closer to me He started getting deep
He had me in a zone When he started to show me things
I never saw before Baby was smooth but I knew it was game
Helluva a cool but you man had the same The way he licked his lips
And touched my hips I knew that he was slick
Got me lit like a candlestick Get too hot when you touch the tip
You got me going again Baby you got me going again You make sick
He told me you would make it worth it
But thinking how many times have I heard this
Got him feeling but I'm not even nervous
All his slick ass lines were kind of working
I felt my knees get weak But he was calling me
Just couldn't take the heat Anyway it was two or three
I had to get out the streets Baby was cool but I knew it was game
He was too smooth to be screaming my name
And even though we made the best of it I still told him this
Got me lit like a candlestick Get too hot when you touch the tip
You got me going again Baby you got me going again You make sick
Got me lit like a candlestick Get too hot when you touch the tip
You got me going again Baby you got me going again You make sick
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip
Driving me crazy baby don't you quit
You got me going again
Baby you got me going again
I want you and I hate it
Hot when you touch the tip
I gotta get a grip of this
Driving me crazy baby don't you quit
Peep my credentials involving instrumentals
Rhymes massage the cells in the mental
Every since the departing days of the juice crew
I move through baby real natural
Metamorphic boric like acid no hat tricks a classic
So park that ass like Jurassic and check the matrix
Flips scripts like acrobatics intrinsic in rapping
Like insulin to diabetics text is didactic
Flex facts like hydraulics when vexed
Breaks out analogies like pollen do allergies
Raps react radio act like DJ Ran and Colby
Limbs I twist and I bend common episodes past freak mode the monstrous
Vision I'm not among loony nut cakes on a mission I gets in where I
Fit in cause life's too short so you could all label me weirdo but yo
I know it's talent ...
At present I speak the new beginning when every other trend fell short
So who'll be the shareholder of my kinda thoughts besides the studious
Spontaneity within me depicted kicked it true vibes pops jazz but
Collaborated with the cool known flows but unfamiliar grooves soothe
Individual moods like soul food for thought ...
Keeps enhancing brain child's ability to like surpass a swarm of booty
Get hot like sun rays but save your jazz for Sun Ra you don't wanna
Higher levels and heights cerebral flow takes flight on airborne time
Stab at three vocabulary mastery presented retention extended through
Randomly selected ran like red lights by eager paramedics majestic
In stereo phonic or mono my lingo tingle topics revolves around
Science of optics and poses as nuances scripture glitters like
Please accept these feelings I possess I'm like a damsel in distress in
But still I picked you like a daffodil
And you can count on that like you would an abacus so
Nature do the rest...
When we go wit the butters boo you know how we do
Live like my 93 shit funk vibe
Raps way back at the plat wit super bad disco
MC jewel t rocked ride the cross fade
To ruggedness lyrical terrorists
Consumption to each one suckered in or rather lured by each lyric
Finer degrees or shall I say meters of rap and poetry combine to make
You what I'll hit you up soon as I'm ready when I see your Mitsubishi
Peeps I said I thought you was together your actions bounce on all
Do what you gotta do but it ain't what you do its how you do it...
Do you remember those you chase to forget back when ya ears was wet
Minds rust from dawn to dusk I rest in Mecca the words sound power as
Shook hearted kids who shouldn't started lyrics leave like spirits and
Trojans major mental corrosion like Murray's meat unfrozen I am the
Chosen Earth Sun Moon and Stars hard for me to find a top contender
Just to spar some peep the exterior and believe inferior next ya know
Pleasurable acts navigated hearts strings steady with the grace of God
And formed an entity out of puppy love greeted by a choice now body
Employs a bundle of joy journey onto motherhood instantly begins
Precious from conception was this little life within delicate and
Special open arms are welcoming initiative from mommy to secure your
Innocents life centers around you like the rings on Saturn you make it
Until infinity as long as I breathe you get the biggest part of me...
I service and protect guide and direct share quality time with you and
Never neglect any part of you because I have no regrets will always be
Around even if your daddy jets providing you with confidence to step
Out in the world aware that you could make it cause you have someone
Who cares on stand by with patience and a smile God bare my witness
Haven't guessed the essence of my presence to insure you have the best
And I just really hope you understand that for you I'll be everything
Get the biggest part of me...
Wonderful addition to the population your every waking moment is my
Inspiration truly I am blessed from on day to the next life line
Connects to a positive effect you've molded all my idol time and gave
It purpose I dedicate the world to you until my final rest cradle to
Infinity as long as I breathe you get the biggest part of me. For real

Media slogan we uphold negative promotion
To pigeon hole attention of the weak and the hopeless
No wonder generation X remains emotionless
Everybody plays the fool
Sometimes the main ingredient used in ploy confirming what was stated previous
But if the anchor realizes his position is a gift
He'd truly honor what his mission is...
Talk about beautiful things a little bit
Talk about beautiful things a little bit
Talk about beautiful things a little bit
Is it only tragedy when harmony unites the people of this nation. We must
Learn to break this cycle of hate and disrespect among our brothers and
A bullet make a life shatter like a glass jaw
They want to blame it on the gangs but it's a bigger picture
Every death in black America is gang related
When I was young I wanted to be a thug
I hit my knees and drop my head between and ask the Lord
Tell me how many Haiti bottles I gotta empty
All this dirt being done ain't gang related
Trouble throughout the Earth. We have returned into a force of death and
Destruction on ourselves. We were never meant to be trapped in this
Wouldn't want to be anything but who you are. We have one change but one
Looking at my Gucci it's about that time
Looking at my Gucci it's about time
Looking at my Gucci it's about that time
Looking at my Gucci it's about time
As the clock keeps ticking in this hip hop shit
My main objective is to float way above the average
Speech reaching the multitude standing form of what I believe in
My all races of heaven for the one who's truth seeking
Be the vessel for messages so far without preaching
Before knowledge of self I walk through darkness like a heathen
Then my lust of words start giving life new meaning
Strengthen of my inner regions so my aura could be beaming
Spirit got to be that when I first pledge allegiance
Thus spawning the lessons in the song I be singing
Thus spawning the lessons in the song I be singing
I got for what I know to help the growth of human beings
Looking at my Gucci it's about that time
Looking at my Gucci it's about time
Looking at my Gucci it's about that time
Looking at my Gucci it's about time
I insist you close lips and pay homage
Approach me with steady caution like the new millennium
Nowhere to run from when words sprung like volcanic ash
So somewhere in the future they can find you in the past
Looking at my Gucci it's about that time
Looking at my Gucci it's about time
Looking at my Gucci it's about that time
Looking at my Gucci it's about time
Spit reality rap over this Frankenstein track
Recorded reported facts of an urban inhabitant
Evade the ghetto death traps by using my thinking cap
Any verse I use is a virtual patient
General thoughts so strong they linger on like a fragrance
Relate the folks from many walks of life and all ages
Lend you a hand if your vision were ever jaded
For as the future cop me as one who try to save it
The impact of this music really ain't nothing to play with
The hip hop president of this republic
I break the lease and get bent on rappers to pay rent
Try to overthrow my government it ain't going to happen
I'm a real brother with a lasting impression
Forcing dedicated rappers to just quit their whole profession
No question on the mission verbal oral expedition
Wise words formulate the deadly verbal lyricism
Stand clear from my dears is what I always advise
Looking at my Gucci it's about that time
Looking at my Gucci it's about time
Looking at my Gucci it's about that time
Looking at my Gucci it's about time
Roll out the fabric carpet
Hook up those microphones
Could be the mayor of the city
And clean up all of this mess
I'd never be assassinated
In my bullet proof vest
You can't keep a good girl down
No you can't keep a girl down
I've been lost and found
No you can't keep a good girl down
You can't keep a good girl down
No you can't keep a girl down
I've been lost and I've been found
You can't keep a good girl down
You can't keep a good girl down
No you can't keep a good girl down
I've been lost and found
No you can't keep a good girl down
And I'll take the biggest jug and
Smash it over your head
You can't keep a good girl down
No you can't keep a good girl down
I've been lost and found
No you can't keep a good girl down
You can't keep a good girl down
No you can't keep a good girl down
I've been lost and I've been found
Follow my lead as I delve into channels of chi affix harmony
Sole purpose on the physical plane
Is to master my mind soul spirit and anatomy
Gradually map out destiny
Embrace the oneness that rest in me
Build a force field for the negativity
Then within it find out what the lesson be
Subsequent to substance drawn off the perineum point or Hui Yin
Union Of the fem and the masculine become primary goals for the selves
Then be somewhere in the mix when life begins...
Inherited simpler ways to make better days
Striving to pave a steady trail evading the maze
That in turn alienates and stagnates true state of your place
In the scheme of things
Face truth even if it do like bee stings
Attitude is till footloose and fancy free broaden my horizon
These feed off most high source surrounding me
See each and every movement merely
As a chance to bond and correspond with power of the all in existence
Learn it love it live it...
Freak on to the early morn
You got The Roots in the house
With you ears now proceed
It's flavor you wouldn't believe as we proceed
The Roots collaborate I see myself as rather great
As if in the course flow with intensive force
You best to go and check your source about my textual course
But after you critique it you can kiss it
I'm assisting fire force that leaves statistics
My lyrics send you on a permanent excursion
I can split the Red Sea but deadly
One time for the mind
The real is not whole or half time
I got to deal with everything on this intelligent plain
To the pain I live a High Life like Miller
Respect recognize with mind beyond wise
They be flop and over it
My click rolls thicker than the Black Panther party
Up next for Generation X
Most of these rap cats is barely fresh
For all you big shots that thought you had this rap game locked
Get in the stands and swing hands
You in this game wit some serious cats
Perhaps we could adapt to those that spit flows
I think on the blink off some serious drinks
See the cause of the blaze
While you dab your face wit the hankie tenderly
Tell me what's your name
Maybe a little bit later
Maybe a little bit later
Moonlit skies in the city of dreams
Made my way towards the crowd
So I walked over and said
Tell me what's your name
Maybe a little bit later
Tell me what's your name
Maybe a little bit later
Offered her a drink before round 2
So we could take the time to be properly introduced
Finally got to talk and swap info
Showed her who was boss with a shot of patron
Slipped the invite and the move was right
Tell me what's your name
Maybe a little bit later
Maybe a little bit later
It was love at first sight and I couldn't help but notice
I seen you posing in a golden silhouette
You used to say I had a way with words
I didn't think we would split like decisions
I guess I can't have my cake and eat it too
You said we were meant to be
Pressured me out to take the one thing that means everything
It's all because I'm waiting till the timing is right
It's no surprise you got a man
But I see you giving mixed signals like you wanna take a chance
When there's something about us I'd like to share with you
I wanna be the reason that you smile everyday
But the way things seem I may be
Lately we've been way to close
Guilty grin when you can't say no
Maybe you need to let things go
I might not be the right one
It might not be the right time
But there's something about us I have to say
It might not be the right time
I might not be the right one
But there's something about us I got to do
Some kind of secret I will share with you
I need you more than anything in my life
I want you more than anything in my life
I'll miss you more than anyone in my life
It caught his eye from the distance
Took foot through the stakes that they put on his plate
Came a long way since he went the wrong way
A harsh reality some call life
If only I'd... it would be alright
But this time I'm coming in a full steamed stride
Got my hands raised up and my head held high
He once carried the weight of the world
This he learned from the days when he raised from his worst
Stuck between rock bottom and the hard knocks
All he knew was he had to move on
The kid task flipped and he hasn't even noticed
A chance to make up for mistakes he's made
And finally reassured when he heard the song say...
Got my hands raised up and my head held high
Tell me do you got what I need
The stickiest trees and a bottle of JD
Nowadays everybody got two
There's something you really gotta hear
I bet you think I'm selfish
I just can't seem to get you off my brain
Simple arithmetic to get us through
Grinding on a 9 to 5 scene seen dreams
So I'm puffing on the weed hoping to sprout some green
Can you blame me for situations I face
Trying to escape till the day I get a taste of my fate
If I could erase mistakes correct those I've yet to make
I solemnly swear to stay sharp like razor blades
Create ways to evade this place in a major way
So I take a page release my rage and anger fades away
Observe sin as the world spins I'm trying to grab a hold
Downward spiral type of whirlwind spinning down the whole
It's about envisioning the goal and how you finish when you go
I might not be the right one
It might not be the right time
But there's something about us I have to say
It might not be the right time
I might not be the right one
But there's something about us I got to do
Some kind of secret I will share with you
I need you more than anything in my life
I want you more than anything in my life
I'll miss you more than anyone in my life
Too many goody goody two shoes say
A master face like a masquerade
Parade and those who ain't a least bit afraid
But the police spray a whole can of mace
I run I run I'm on high pursuit
Fuck that rule I'll rock at you
Knuckle to the tooth that'll knock it loose
Broke in a motherfucker's pockets dude
The schools not teaching you how to earn no dough
See I believe in the block
Used to be owned by Mom and Pop
Keep a white tee and worn denim jeans on my Chucks
Soul Assassin fitted cap with the brim flipped back
Sun go up and the sun come down
The money get low and the gun comes out
Somebody tell them kids to slow down
I said sun go up sun come down
Money get low guns come out
Somebody tell them kids to slow down
Like Splinter I'm in the sewers
Listen you cannot pursue us
In such a marvelous fashion know in a flash that it could happen
Whatever form of action
I know you see me dummy
They think you got the look
You a mark or a crook
They don't do it by the book
It don't matter where you stay in around yo town
When the seasons start to change and them rainclouds clown
Sun go up and the sun come down
The money get low and the gun comes out
Somebody tell them kids to slow down
I said sun go up sun come down
Money get low guns come out
I should like to see my
Farewell to this land's cheerless marshes
Hemmed in like a boar between arches
Her very Lowness with a head in a sling
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the 18th pale descendant
Of some old queen or other
With a sponge and a rusty spanner
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But when you're tied to your Mother's apron
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
Like love and law and poverty
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But the rain that flattens my hair
Past the pub who saps your body
And the church who'll snatch your money
And it's so lonely on a limb
Past the pub that wrecks your body
And it's so lonely on a limb
And this track is dedicated to all the ladies out there that like to go to the movies
I'm sure later on you will be my baby.
Let's just sit down be by my side.
I got the popcorn I know what else you like.
You got nothing to worry about
Hold the popcorn and the drink

So we can see what's going on.
If you like to watch you can lean on my chest
Take a rest do your best.

Who do you believe in
You go and take your pick
My religion is better than yours
The reason we got more than two religions
Is because the demons
I hope you all live in peace
But when I see on TV in Middle East
You took somebody's life
You will give him a gun to go and shoot
But God didn't say kill and you did
Who do you believe in
Are you Muslim or Christian
Who do you believe in this religion
Who do you believe in
Are you Muslim or Christian
Who do you believe in this religion
Christians celebrate Christmas
Only one God can judge us
You go and take your pick
Don't say you go to church and pray
Two minutes later you look away
To have a conversation with
Now you disturb the peace
You said you believe in God
Now look why don't you see
Respect yourself before you go in
I'm sure you do the same thing
Who do you believe in
Are you Muslim or Christian
Who do you believe in this religion
Who do you believe in
Are you Muslim or Christian
Who do you believe in this religion
Lord can you hear me speak
We need help out here
This Earth is messed up
I wonder when will it be clear
Only God can judge me
But I'm cool with everybody
You wanna know who is he
Are you with them or you with me
How many books written in this religion
A lot of churches built of diamonds
If you Muslim or Christian
You know your own way
But the bed you use when yo go the wrong way
Who do you believe in
Are you Muslim or Christian
Who do you believe in this religion
Who do you believe in
Are you Muslim or Christian
Who do you believe in this religion

But ooh I've been waiting for you
Ooh I've been waiting for you
Never had a day worth planning

Man I'm like a fly on the wall
And these four walls heard it all

But them words won't hurt at all
Champagne form bubbles in my bong
All I need is the love of my crew
Never been to work with a briefcase
So I'm from my ex and said be great
First thought like she fake

All she know is turn up girl slow down
Till she tore her knee up
Already caught the vibes

Met her out in France and her ass meaner
Long ways from them days when we had peanuts
Looked back we just laugh like damn we up

Fiji water in my iron

Cause each day we wake up
We smoke L's we make love
We bump Soul in your basement
Bump Cole in my truck
No need to ask I'll bring her pour me a glass
And if it's mine that's you honey
Stick together like new money
Hit Dubai on that dune buggies
Catch some rays like it's Tampa Bay
And I know what drives you crazy
On how I switch daily
From love is so amazing
To love is so enslaving
Yet all you have is patience
Fight for us as if life is love
If love is gone it's dead life in us
I hear my devil's enticing but
They run amok every night
Fiji water in my iron
Yeah I gotta stay fresh
Fiji water in my iron
Ho I gotta stay fresh
Fiji water in my iron
Yeah I gotta stay fresh
Fiji water in my iron
Cause each day we wake up
We smoke L's we make love

Bump Cole in my truck
And she was like Lauryn Hill tell him
But she couldn't understand
Cause every time we go out we go out with a bang
She just want a taste
Bitch you never wear the smiley face OK
Don't you ever let me go to waste
Black star so we couldn't burn out
That's fine I'm the shit to me
That's fine I'm the shit to me
Girl it's been awhile since I hit a White Owl
Don't remember her in her clothes
That's the last time I seen her though
Stamp it like it's my visa
When the world gets heavy and it hurts to carry
I'm her Midnight Mercenary
She take me to a place that I never would discover
Say he got a case of straps at the back of the hotel cupboard
Photo finish and fornication
Photo finish and fornication
So maybe we should just not use this and use the other intro
So people would think I just took it straight through
You'd be surprised how many truths you can hide in flows
I never thought that I would fuck Irish hoes
Maybe Asian bitches or Caucasian bitches
Remember when I got to New York I was lost
Because all I ever saw was Jamaican bitches
Maybe if you put yourself in the shoes
No gold grill just a east coast feel
And a set of crooked teeth in his mouth
If you ain't got my tape in your truck
I think I lost my mind round the same time I lost my six pack
Long as a ho still give up for me
She usually charge but she get us for free
Scared of the days you'll be seeing me
That's something for the hoop fans
Just copped her the coupe man
No drop top but a slot on the roof that can slide out
And get a little sun while you ride out
Ced on the beat let me vibe out
Now at the shows he the main attraction
When she with me got your bitch open
And she gone give more when she with me got yo bitch smoking
When she with me got your bitch open
And she gone give more when she with me got yo bitch smoking
No tats but my passport got plenty
I say fuck it I would like plenty
How many of these nights do I got in me
Couldn't really tell blind everyday same time
Picture every face drawn on got on a for sale sign
See I'm bout my bread mother fucker and I can't afford a stale mind
And they gotta take squats on the jail time
And that shit work you see it
Put your latest work in a hearse and I send it to the dirt
When she with me got your bitch open
And she gone give more when she with me got yo bitch smoking
When she with me got your bitch open
And she gone give more when she with me got yo bitch smoking
Yeah you know the models on the coupe
But you don't even know what's in your food
Be alert be alert be alert be alert
Put your young ass in debt
Be alert be alert be alert be alert
Be alert be alert be alert be alert
I swear it feel like a quarter to midnight
And all they could respond is you never gave enough
Everything gratuitous
Never taking it for granted like I'm new to this
Just got out the meeting and they talking big figures
And these bitches all in my runway
Cause that's all it would take
I was born ready my first home was Paris
Now I roam New York where the chrome is heavy
Get too hyper boy that shit will have to quit
If you take the tumble come back up that happen quick
Met her at my show damn that just happened quick
Bearded like the Pharaoh but I'm Nubian truly him
What's your problem with me don't know how to relate
Last Winter hot bitches and cold brews
That shit don't get me
Let me be just let me be free
These bitches latch on like a stowaway
She get on my last nerve I tell her go away
I fuck her once that bitch is a throw away
Don't need no designer clothes but I'll take them designer drugs
Me I'd rather fly the rug
Take another step and we will teach a lesson
Paramedics do get involved
Boy you gotta pay ya dues to the cause
It's my house take ya shoes when you walk in
And these hoes make appointments now
I ain't got time for appointments that don't flock
And bitches that come back to my crib and don't pop
On a blank canvas Bas so incredibly dope
Man I'm so fly I see the heavens approaching
The Judge a crook he throw the book at every case
My star ripped out my heart and told me replace it
You say you want me to have the world
I get it I get it I get it
She been down so long she gotta even up
You feel I be a new guy as soon as it sets in
You don't want me to make it
You say you want me to have the world
So watch the story of a young thug
Bring the shit like you want it
I'll leave you with a death wish
Your peoples miss you thinking you're alive
Instead of fucking with us you better get with us
While your priest bother calling
Has a sly trade of where my crew is from
I bring it back to Allah
But still you fronted
That's what you get when you fuck with rap
Never shake hands with a crooked wanna be
Then they go and party to heads that's always live
Criticize the rappers have had enough of what we say
We gonna bust your ear drums
If ya want it son then bring it
Young thug busting slugs
Just grab you bag of money
Now it's time you represent
So listen to my sound
Come clean in every scene
Try to make it on my own
See I was chilling downtown with my whole case crew
Bumping new tapes by Godfather D and crew
These radicals them cock blocking
Claiming they finish you
They thinking we booty just like they whole crew
Can't stand us looking here different
I mastered your art form to be a hardcore composer
Easy while to roll it when my blunts are all over
I'm just like you but might not share the same vision
Now you're paranoia from the dime sack we sold ya
Chilling downtown with my whole crew
Just chilling downtown with my whole crew
Chilling downtown with my whole crew
Chilling downtown with my whole crew
Just chilling downtown with my whole crew
Chilling downtown with my whole crew
I kick the politics about the devil's tricks
So for them Jordan kicks got me out here throwing sticks
Seek what I'm talking about
Shorty and mack daddy's coming your way
Open speakers blasting
Get a good night's kiss
Polo gear fly from head to toe they got stolen
They go me playing superstar there for a second
For now hustling is the key
Success will wait for next G
Call for backup it's pay day
Call for backup it's pay day
Call for backup it's pay day
Call for backup it's pay day
It's time we connect son
Let's have a piece of them chips
I think they mommy's lying
Bumping Notorious Hypnotize
You better freeze man
Here's the last chapter
Watch the super duper come around
But I be the one coming straight from the underground
But if you can't let me fucking up the program
I'll show you who's the man
Got to be twisting something
While these beats be pumping
I'm going to take you in
When I'm getting mad jumpy
You know what I'm saying
You know what I'm saying... yo
Something for the bad boy squad
Something for the bad boy crew
I want a diamond with you
Mikey mania in the world of rapping
And it's made for the whole nation
So better get your plantation
You know about the operation
Act right before you pay the price
Act right before you pay the price
Act right before you pay the price
I got some rap things to get into
Your fake fronts all busted up like supposed to
The get down and get busy all over you son
L's after L's got me lifted like your wind blown
I think I need some bad guys to point the finger
I'm trying to reach ya through your sound speaker
Sleeping Mikey is a problem nowadays
Drink some vodka mixed with weed
By hearing fake player
Licking mad shots from the Yukon truck
And you try to come around the back
Your rhyme styles suck
Because you got stuck by the rhymes you thought
Should have thought about that
L's after L's got me lifted like your wind's blown
I think you need some bad guys to point the finger
We're trying to reach ya through your speaker
Sleeping Mikey is a problem nowadays
This is the sound when it's booming in ya trunk
That's the sound when it's booming in ya trunk
To break out to her crib
So this is exactly what we did
By the way her name is Precious
She pushes a cherry Lexus
So I'm trying to knock the paisley
Player haters hands down
Forever... trying... to think that you can hang now
I chill the back of the club
I chill the back of the club
I chill the back of the club
Looking for this princess
So peep the words I manifest
Better come through with your digits hon
Like a gold digger miss
Player. Number 1. This is how we do
Something made for your jeeps
Something made for your cars
Something made for your systems
Gotta keep my mouth clean
For critics still sizing
I know this cat who want to be a superstar
Now he wants to battle new scholars
With the Guess sagging
Acting like he fronting
Perfect example of this cat half stepping
I know you heard our shit on the radio
But you ego won't let go because we're raking all your dough
And we ripping all your show
The jelly jelly's envy
The jelly jelly's envy
I make sure that cash rules
Only these politics keep me stranded on this lonely island
And analyze my construction
Some kid went on trying
There's no time to waste
L's after L's got me lifted like your wind blown
L's after L's got me lifted like your wind blown
Represent my click well
I represent the click well
My house is your house today...
My house is your house today
It's no change so beat with the crew that classic
It's no change so beat with the crew that classic
Smiling faces sometimes pretend to be your friend
Smiling faces sometimes pretend to be your friend
They don't tell the truth uh
Tell lies and I got proof
They don't tell the truth
La A la B la C la D la E la F la G la H la I
Bomb threat on the deck right where you are apt to be.
I love the way you move it when we show up and bust this.
So let me ricochet some direct frequency.
I love the way you move it when we show up and bust this.
I love the way you move it when we show up and bust this.
Bomb threat on the deck right where you are apt to be.
20 double bins up front
20 double bins up front
Shoot beams lightening
Melting in rhyme schemes
Sneak a poem in dirty zones
Super soaked in honeycomb
Hologram or telephone
Coming out your speaker cones
20 double bins up front
Sneak a poem in dirty zones
Super soaked in honeycomb
Hologram or telephone
Coming out your speaker cones
Let's let's do it.. like this
You can grab a line on a line this is synergy
Hit that beat Like King Kong
Underneath the crashing waves
You advised me with your tears
Then release your hexes
Right back where you began
Torn apart from the inside
Race back into your skin
By the crawl you bring
You invite me into your face
In between the acid rains
Hypnotize me with your kiss
Then release your hexes
Right back where you began
Torn apart from the inside
Race back into your skin
By the crawl you bring
Losing it all on my own
But the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping now
The strength I need to push me
You show the lights that stop me
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that
And dreaming when they're gone
You show the lights that stop me
Nothing has been broken
Nothing has been broken
Nothing has been broken
Nothing has be further
Further from the truth
Further from the truth
Present past and beyond
Even though they weren't with us too long
Your life is the most precious thing that we could lose
Laugh a minute only the beginning
Present past and beyond
Even though they weren't with us too long
Your life is the most precious thing that we could lose
Laugh a minute only the beginning
Present past and beyond
Even though they weren't with us too long
Your life is the most precious thing that we could lose
Laugh a minute only the beginning
Give me more power and I'm fit to get my sip on
Clean on the get but still get nasty
Dance floor trashy with cups and glitter
Hard days night please don't insult me
Cold like a blizzard when the flow get in it
Hold to the beats while we storm up the beach
We let go so the beats can control
But none can touch what the king dreamed up
He team ringed up my team two gritty
Now we see who keep the party live
Go on give it up cause your boy get cup
And we're moving all around looking ugly
And we moving all around looking ugly
Sometimes it gets ugly
And we moving all around
Sometimes it gets ugly
Live my life on fast forward
Feet up on that dashboard
Hands up off that steering wheel
Call that shit a crash course
I ain't have to take no class for it
Nickname used to be Fast Porsche
Why I gotta be so bad for
A hundred times on that blackboard
Reminisce on my school days
Mama like LL Cool J's
Drunk off all them punches
Tell him he can have his bike back
But I really really like my new chain
Live my life like I do
Her high heels on my side views
My eyes peeled for the 5-0
My horse power match my IQ
My wrist watch be so hypnotizing
My transports be so energizing
You must be a first true love
Butterflies and curly white shores
Between the sheet and no underwear
This need for you burns in all my mind
All the selfish reasons that I had for holding back.
I pretend that you're not gone.
I'm missing your hair tonight
I'm missing the way you whisper in my ear.
Sometimes I wonder if I should take you back.
I watch you walk around this town without me...
I'm missing your eyes tonight...
We'll hit the road and just drive.
I'll even let you win this one your way.
I'll even let you win this one your way.
Telling what our future has in store for me and you.
I'd put my money on it that you don't even know.
Clap ya hands now people clap now
Clap ya hands now people clap ya hands
I seen pappy get a brick
Slap you with the fifth
Rather blow with the case
Never roll with the state
Name hold heavy weight
I sold crack in every state
I got plenty shots to send you
The type that wanna speak when y'all faced with the heat
Size nine nine shells and the tips is flat
My whole outlook on life is a bird's view of the block
I been real before John Lopez
So please don't get it confused
Now everybody put your middle finger in the air
All of a sudden Harlem ain't real like
Ma don't let them front on you there
They ain't pay to get it done
Bitches with babies asking for dollars
But don't know they baby father
An shorty run around with Gucci on her feet
You know them broads who came at me wrong like
This is for my teams on the block
Hollywood rappers who never sold that
That's right you only live once
My whole Time if been looking for good weed
Oh no oh no ho what is to do is my weed so low
Oh no oh no ho I'm not super high
I wanna make a trip so come on girl
I'm looking for the best weed of the World
On the first Day I cruise to Mexico
Have the Odd after was in Brazil
I wanna make a trip so come on girl
I'm looking for the best weed of the World
But all of them don't make me stoned
Thanks God I'm really stoned
I wanna make a trip so come on girl
I'm looking for the best weed of the World
grips grips grips grips
grips grips grips grips grips
grips grips grips grips grips
And on the cool check in
And I got more juice than Picasso got paint
Got rhymes that are rough and rhymes that are slick
I got franks and pork and beans
Always bust the new routines
People always biting and I'm sick of complaining
So I went into the locker room during classes
Went into your locker and I smashed your glasses
And in case you're unaware I carry a gun
Saw the kid that dissed my homeboy and shot him in the back
That's why your girlfriend thinks that I'm so fly
Their father had envy so I shot him in the head
If I played guitar I'd be Jimmy Page
Girls with boyfriends are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike
Taxing all females from coast to coast
And when I get my fill I'm chilly most
And then we all switch places when I ring the bell
But I'm fly at Fat Burger when I way out west
I had this girl at the party and she started to flirt
I told her some rhymes and she pulled up her skirt
Got my hand in my pocket and my finger's on the trigger
We got the kind of voices that are in your face
Like the bun to the burger and like the burger to the bun
Walking down the block with the fresh fly threads
But the crew been said they seen her around
I thought they were right but I didn't wanna know
The girlie was Def and she wanted to go
I think her name is Lucy but they all call Loose
He recognized my girlie from the back of her head
He said a little something about tip to base
So I made him stop the cab to get out of the place
I shouldn't have looked back man I'll always regret it
It's just too bad that girl's a bum
When I seen this girl I could never forget
Now I like nothing better than a pretty girl smile
And I haven't seen a smile that pretty in a while
The girl came up to me she said she loved the show
Asked her to come home and she couldn't say no
He thought she was a thief and D. was right
When I woke up late in the afternoon
She had taken all the things from inside his room
I found myself naked in the middle of the floor
She had taken the bed and the chest of drawers
My remote control and my old skateboard
And the boys blamed me for bringing her home
I drink quarts and cans and bottles and sixes
Between the turntables keep the vodka and the mixes
I like Bullwinkle but I don't like Moose
All the girls in class know that I'm the cool rocker
I keep a pistol in my pocket so you better be cautious
I got to the party and I did the freak
I got a girl in the Castle and one in the pagoda
A mike in my hand and a mouth full of Miller
The turntables up on the drum riser
The needle's in the groove and the vinyl's on the platter
I know that I'm fly man there's no need to flatter
Cheaper than a hot dog with no mustard
You tried to steal my fresh and you got cold busted
Because your crew's all soft and I'm disgusted
And we got more rhymes than your whole damn crew
Stuck you head in the toilet and stone cold flushed it
They got a committee to get me off the block
Because being bad news is what we're all about
We went to White Castle and we got thrown out
I shot homeboy but the bullet was a dud
I'm fly like an eagle and I drink Old Crow
My teacher had beef so I gave her a smack
With bottle in hand at the microphone stand
I got to the party and I got loose
I got dust and I got dusted
I got trees on my mirror so my car won't smell
All the fly ladies are making a fuss
All I really want is girls
And in the morning it's girls
I like the way that they walk
And it's chill to hear them talk
And I can always make them smile
From White Castle to the Nile
There was this girl around the way
He said he would not give her play
Her pants were tight and that's okay
We took a walk down to the bay
I should have probably guessed her gay
So I broke north with no delay
I heard she moved real far away
That was two years ago this May
I seen her just the other day
You missed two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kinda jerk
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag
Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
Engine running hotter than a boiling kettle
Itchy trigger finger but a stable turntable
I do what I do best because I'm willing and able
While you're at the job working nine to five
Another bottle in the brain
Another drive all night
He's got his own room at the back of the bus
We're trashing hotels like it's going out of style
We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back
No sleep till Brooklyn
No sleep till Brooklyn
Ain't seen the light since we started this band
I sip the def ale with all the fly women
Autograph pictures and classy hos
Waking up before I get to sleep
No sleep till Brooklyn
No sleep till Brooklyn
About three bad brothers you know so well
It started way back in history
Def Jam right about now
Now I chill real ill when I start to chill
Got this dance that's more than real
Drink Brass Monkey here's how you feel
Tilt your head back let's finish the cup
Wherever we go with bring the Monkey with us
Double R. foots the bill most definitely
I drink Brass Monkey and I rock well
I got a castle in Brooklyn that's where I dwell
When it's time to get ill I pour it on my face
Monkey tastes Def when you pour it on ice
Come on y'all it's time to get nice
This girl walked by she gave me the eye
I reached in the locker grabbed the Spanish Fly
I put it with the Monkey mixed it in the cup
It did begin the stuff wore in and now she's on my tip
Step up to the bar put the girl down
She takes a big gulp and slaps it around
We had a case in the place and we went right through it
You got a dry martini thinking you're cool
And if you got beef you'll get beat to a pulp
The song and dance keeping you in a trance
If you don't buy my record I got my advance
I love Brass Monkey but I won't give D. it
We got the bottle you got the cup
Not like a fever not like a cold
So don't see a doctor or see a nurse
It's time to party so have a ball
White Castle fries only come in one size
What you see is what you get
And you ain't seen nothing yet
I do not sing but I make a Def song
You could live your whole life and I hope you live long
On the Gong Show we won't get gonged
We don't only rock the house but we'll house the rock
We don't stroll but we roll straight to the top
And we can do it like this in the place to be
Cash on delivery like a COD
The beat is slow in order to dance
First you move your legs and then your arms
It's truly stable and you ought to be able
To dance to the record when it's on the turntable
I'm not the type of person who likes to waste my time
I got all the time that I need to kill
I'd have the pedal to the metal if I had a car
I can drink a quart of Monkey and still stand still
I spent my last dime to refill my fat belly
Riding down the block with my box in my hand
My work is my play because I'm playing when I work
To all the Brooklyn girls
To all the French girls
To all the Oriental girls
To all the Swiss girls
To the Upper East Side mobiles
To all the Jamaican girls
And to the topless dancers
Australian and Brazilian
To the southern belles
To the Puerto Rican girls
Now I rock a house party at the drop of a hat
And I beat a body down with an aluminum bat
They'll be staring at the radio staying up all night
I got a boat to eat shrimp in
Routines I bust and the rhymes that I write
And I'll be busting routines and rhymes all night
Like eating burgers and chicken and you'll be picking your nose
You heard my style I think you missed the point
What's up with your bad breath onion rings
Hurricane you got clout
A puppet on a string I'm paid to sing or rhyme
In a lava lamp inside my brain hotel
Got more rhymes than Jamaicans got mangoes
I got the peg leg at the end of my stump
And if you don't believe us you should question your belief Keith
I'm like Sam the butcher bringing Alice the meat
In the back of the ride and bust with the whippet
My style was wild and you know that it still is
Disco bag schlepping and you're doing the bump
I gave him fifty cents to buy some soup
He knows the time with the fresh Gucci watch
He's even more over than my mayor Ed Koch
Washing windows on the Bowery at a quarter to four
With the hand me down food and the hand me down clothes
A rockabilly past of which nobody knows
Makes his home all over the place
He goes to sleep by falling down on his face
Sometimes known as the leader of the homeless
He's got the hand me down Pumas and the tie dyes
Well you go upstate and get your head together
Thunderbird is the word and you're light as a feather
Detox at the flop house no booze allowed
Remember the good old days with the rockabilly crowd
Memphis is where he's from um in Tennessee
He lives in the street but he's no bum no
He's a rockabilly star from the days of old
He used to have teeth all filled with gold
He got a platinum voice but only gold records
On the bass was boots and on the drums was checkers
Donald Trump and Donald Tramp living in the Men's Shelter
He asks for a dollar you know what it's for
Man bottle after bottle he always needs more
He's no less important than you working class stiffs
He drinks a lot of liquor but he don't drink piss
He paid his dues playing the blues
He claims that he wrote the Blue Suede Shoes
Elvis shaved his head when he went into the army
Ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg
Launched that shot and he was caught out there
Saw the convertible driving by
He went for his to find he didn't have one
I go inside your house and bust out your wife
Left my man standing with an egg mustache
Suckers they come a dime a dozen
Humpty Dumpty was a big fat egg
He was playing the wall then he broke his leg
I egged the chicken and then I ate his leg
Riding the trains in between cars
It was then that I caught catching people out there
We all dressed in black
The eggs did crack on Haze's back
You made the mistake and judge a man by his race
You go through life with egg on your face
Looked up and saw egg dripping from the ceiling
I'll dog anybody with an egg in my hand
Not like the crack that you put in a pipe
Egg Man Egg Man Egg Man
Egg Man Egg Man Egg Man
Egg Man Egg Man Egg Man
The high plains drifter and I'm the drifter
They're never gonna know that I'm the High Plains Drifter
Pulled over to the river to take a rest
Pulled out a pair of pliers and pulled the bullet out of my chest
Fear and loathing across the country listening to my 8 track
I reached behind the seat to snatch a cool one from the pack
A long distance from my girl and I'm talking on the cellular
She said that she was sorry and I said yeah the hell you were
Check the odometer and I was on my way
A strapped shoplifter a pirate on cassette
Radar detector to tell me where the cops is
Spend another night at the Motel 6
It's five dollars extra get the porno flicks and then I
Concoct a black and tan in my brandy snifter
Cash flow getting low so I had to pull a job
I found a nice place to visit but a better place to rob
And then I went inside to make my withdrawal
I saw all that he had but I had to take it all
Knucklehead deli tried to gyp me on the price
So I clocked him off the turban with the bag of ice
I made my getaway and then I thought that I had it made
I couldn't help to notice I was caught in a speed trap
Dirty Mary Crazy Larry on the run from Dirty Harry
Stash the cash in the dash but my gun I did carry
I'm seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night
I got my alibi straight and I pulled over to the right
You've got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire
Read me my rights fingerprinted and booked
Wherever I hang my hat's my home and my past is kind of blurry
Every dog will have its day and mine will be in front of a jury
I'm the High Plains Drifter you know I'm never in a hurry
Read me my rights as if I didn't know this
Threw me in the tank with the drunk called Otis
Phony paper passing at Nix Check Cashing
I went before the judge he sent me to the Brooklyn House of D.
He said you behave or we'll throw away the key
I bet on one horse to win and another to show
And sure enough that nag came in
Brought my ticket to the window and collected my win
And then I broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger
Now here we go dropping science dropping it all over
Like bumping around the town like when you're driving a Range Rover
Expanding the horizons and expanding the parameters
Rock well to tell dispel all of the old fables
And I've been kicking the new knowledge
Now the dregs of the earth and the eggs that I eat
I've got pegs through my hands and one through my feet
Shea Stadium the radium E M D squared
Kicked out of the Palladium you think that I cared
It's the sound of science
The sounds of science
Time and money for girls covered with honey
You lie and aspire to be as cunning
Order the quarter deluxe why don't you wake up
Had to get up to get the Jimmy protector
Went berserk and worked and exploded
She woke up in the morning and her face was coated
D. do what you like huh D.
Well Drunk a skunk am I from the celebration
To peep that freak unique penetration
Well I figured out who makes the crack
It's the suckers with the badges and the blue jackets
And people always asking what's the phenomenon
No one really knows what I'm talking about
Ponce De Leon constantly on
Peace is a word I've heard before
So move and move and move upon the dance floor
Not like a roach or a piece of toast
Well with my nose I knows and with my scopes I scope
What I live I write and that is strictly rope
I've got science for any occasion
Postulating theorems formulating equations
Eating chicken gizzards with a girl named Lizzy
Never sleep alone because Jimmy is the magnet
I'm so rope they call me Mr. Roper
When the troubles arise you know I'm the cool coper
Excuse me young lady I don't mean to trouble ya
I got lucky I brought home the kitten
Before I got busy I slipped on the mitten
Can't get better odds because I'm a sure thing
Proud Mary keeps on turning and rolling like a Ring Ding
Jump the turnstile never pay the toll
Customs jailed me over an herb seed
Don't rat on your boy over some rat weed
Your boyfriend doesn't know about me and you're mother
Not perfect grammar always perfect timing
The Mike stands for money and the D. is for diamonds
Roses are red the sky is blue
The engine is the music and my nine's by my side
A lot of parents like to think I'm a villain
I might be a little dusted but I'm not insane
I was making records when you were sucking on your mother's dick
Girl you're walking tall now in your fancy clothes
You're a dog on a leash like a pig in a pen
If your life needs correction don't follow my direction
Cause I'm running things like some Mack motherfucker
You slip you slack you clock me and you lack
Poetry in motion coconut lotion
Are you experienced little girl
I want to know what goes on in your little girl world
I'll take your pride for a ride if you let me
Full throttle to the bottle and full full clout
There never was a city kid truer and bluer
There's more to me than you'll ever know
Words are flowing out just like the Grand Canyon
And I'm always out looking for a female companion
I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib
I took off her moccasins and put on my bib
I'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peeling
Your body's on time and your mind is appealing
Staring at the cracks up there upon the ceiling
Such and such will be the bass that I'm throwing
I'm telling her every lie that you know that I never did
Me in the corner with a good looking daughter
The gift of gab is the gift that I have
And that girl ain't nothing but a drag
I'm Adam and I'm adamant about living large
I've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside
Ladies flock like bees to a hive
Hey hey hey hey ladies
Hey hey hey hey ladies
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey ladies
She'll show you a good time and then she'll show you the door
I threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed
Take my advice at any price
Sucking down pints till I didn't know
Woke up in the morning with the One Ton Ho
With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce
Girls with curls and big long locks
And beatnik chicks just wearing their smocks
Walking high and mighty like she's number one
Hey hey hey hey ladies
Rolling down the hill I'm snowballing getting bigger
An explosion in the chamber the hammer from the trigger
Had a small problem with the transmission
3 on the tree in the middle of the night
Life comes in phases take the good with the bad
It's gonna get you girl it's gonna get you
Ultra violence be running through my head
Rapid fire Louie like Rambo got bullets
Predetermined destiny is who I am
You got your finger on the trigger like the Son of Sam
I've got homeboys bonanza to beat your ass down
Well I'm mad at my desk and I'd be writing all curse words
Expressing my aggressions through my schizophrenic verse words
You're looking for a fist to put your face in
Well get hip get hip don't slip you knuckle heads
Some static started in the pool hall
Hit a motherfucker's face with the cue ball
So I smacked her in the booty with a Plank Bee
Possession is half the law
I had my routines before all y'all
You ain't nothing but a car thief biting routines
See I'm a city slicker I ain't no townie
Right now I wish I had another hash brownie
Like Ricky always said you've got to toke and pass
You try to take what isn't yours like a God damn rat
I'm a writer a poet a genius I know it
People always trying to get next to me
I had a beautiful experience on ecstasy
I smoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer
Because I had to deal with a money hungry miser
Saw my teeth fall in the sink when I started to brush
You be doing nose candy on the Bowie Coke Mirror
My girl asked for some but I pretended not to hear her
You can't deny me you always want to try me
Yo you're just gonna get your ass kicked
Homeboy throw in the towel
Your girl got dicked by Ricky Powell
The Godfather of Soul in the belly of the beast
All the wife beaters and all the tax cheaters
Sitting in the White House pulling their peters
The only cop with a rope chain with the walking the beat
I feel like it is always the beginning
Reach into my mind for the rhymes I'm seeking
Like a garbage bag full overflowing now it's leaking
Rapunzel Rapunzel let down your hair
So I can climb up and get into your underwear
Rat soup eating test cheating no business punk
You're insecure born in the junkyard with the junk
You've gone wet look crazy and messed with your head
You fucked around and wound up with the bald skin head
So get that money out of your ass you whore
I brought her upstairs onto the roof
Clean B cleaning the G spot you know that we've got
Look out my window look over the city
With two black eyes your girl ain't that pretty
Why you wanna beat that brat with a bat
Why you wanna beat your girl like that
Living in the rat race smoking rat weed
You reap what you sow when you plant the seed
Bum cheese on rye with ham and prosciutto
Riddle me this brother can you handle it
Your style to my style you can't hold a candle to it
Equinox symmetry and the balance is right
It's not how you play the game it's how you win it
I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic
For those about to rock we salute you
The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to
I once was lost but now I'm found
The music washes over and you're one with the sound
And the man upstairs I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire
Only 24 hours in a day
Music for all and not just one people
More Adidas sneakers than a plumber got pliers
If not for my vices and my bugged out desires
My year would be good just like Goodyear's tires
I mix business with pleasure way too much
I don't get blue I gotta mean red streak
You don't pay the band your friends and that's weak
Get even like Steven like pulling a Rambo
Steal from the rich and I'm out robbing banks
Give it to the poor and I always give thanks
I hold the title and you are the challenger
I've got money like Charles Dickens
Always go out dapper like Harry S. Truman
Smoke the holy chalice got my own religion
Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians
Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born
And the man upstairs I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire
Amps and crossovers under my rear hood
The best in men's clothing
Call Paul's Boutique ask for Janice
There's a girl over there
I took her to the place
I threw the mattress in her face
Right about now I'd like to dedicate this song
Let's be real and don't cloud the issue
The rhymes are dope an emcee you must listen to
One half science and another half soul
Well Mike D is a special individual
Groggy eyed and fried and I'm headed for the station
In the back of the one train
And then I jump the turnstile
Right between the cars
You know you light up when the lights go down
And then you read the New York Post
Same faces every day but you don't know their names
Prostitute's spandex caught in the slide door
Now you're stuck between the stations
And it seems like an eternity
Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity
Got a fifty dollar fine for disturbing the peace
Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm
Bust into the conductor's booth and busted out rhymes
Over the loud speaker about the hard times
Riding the train down from the El Barrio
Went from the station to Orange Julius
And my body and soul and mind are pure
Not polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure
Enter the arena as I take center stage
The lights set low and the night has come of age
Take the microphone in hand as that I am a professional
Speak my knowledge to the crowd and the Ed is special
For I am the bard and I am the last one
I am the king and this is my castle
Seen a glimpse from ahead and I don't think it's gonna last
And you can bet your ass
I put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend
I am one with myself as I turn to Thee
Prefer the dreams to the reality
I prefer my life don't need no other man's wife
Don't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife
But it's good to have a turn to be the king for a day
Everything has changed but remains the same
And I see myself as clear as day
He who sees the end from the beginning of time
Looking forward through all the ages
Check the prophetic sections of the pages
You know The Bronx is up and I'm Brooklyn down
Building bombs in the attic for elected officials
You know I cut my boss because I don't care
You tried to get slick you bust a little chuckle
You're gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle
I'm a buffalo soldier broader than Broadway
I want to enjoy the fruits of my labor
If you open the book then you will get your hand slapped
I stay at home just like a hermit
I shot a man in Brooklyn
She's slipping through his fingers as she's moving out to the coast
Met a girl at a party and I gave her my card
Your face turns red as your glass of wine
Here's another one for y'all to peep
I met this girl last night with a peculiar cackle
Had too much to drink at the Red Lobster
Now the room is spinning around like the blades of a helicopter
Never met a girl that was too finicky
If the press has their way then they're going to finish me
If I ate spinach I'd be called Spinach D
Ride around town like a Raymond Burr
I'm so high they call me Your Highness
I keep my friends around so I have someone to talk to
Jazzy Jay in the house
Bad Brains in the house
There's a girl over there
I took her to the place
I threw the mattress in her face
You say fuck that I say fuck this
One half science and the other half soul
His name's Mike D. not Fat Morton Jelly Roll
Got over on your girl cause you know she never says no
Well Mike D. is a special individual
Pulling out knots pulling in residuals
Groggy eyed and fried I'm headed for the station
They'll be kicking out windows high on cocaine
Riding between the cars pissing smoking
Two bums fucking I seen them rocking
Head for the last car fluorescent light blackout
Policeman told my homeboy put that crack out
You know you light up when the lights go down
Read the New York Post Fulton St. downtown
Same faces every day but you don't know their names
French trench coat wing tip going to work
Pulling a train like Captain Kirk
Pick pocket gangsters paying their debts
Overworked and underpaid staring at the floor
Prostitutes spandex caught in the ding dong doors
Stuck between the stations it seems like an eternity
Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity
Fine for disturbing the peace
The neck tortoise the Lees creased
Elevated platform never gonna conform
Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm
Bust into the conductor's booth and busted out rhymes
Over the loud speaker about the hard times
Riding the train down from El Barrio
Went from the station straight to Orange Julius
So as pray and hope and the message is sent
Because I'm down with the three the unstoppable three
And my body and soul and mind are pure
Not polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure
Just lyrics from I to you recited
Enter the arena as I take center stage
The lights set low and the night has come of age
Take the microphone in hand as that I am a professional
Speak my knowledge to the crowd and the ed. is special
For I AM a bard but not the last one
I'm my own king and this is my castle
Seen a glimpse from ahead and I don't think it's gonna last
And you can bet your ass
I drop the L. when I'm skiing
I'm smoking and peaking
I put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend
Broke my bindings the lion with wings
I AM one with myself as I turn to The
I prefer the dreams to reality
I prefer my life don't need no other man's wife
Don't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife
But it's good to have turn to be a king for a day
Or for a week or for a year or for a year in a day
I'm fishing with my boat and I'm fishing for trout
Mix the Bass Ale with the Guinness Stout
Fishing for a line inside my brain
And looking out at the world through my window pane
Everything has changed but remains the same
So once again the mirror raised and I see myself as clear as day
And I AM going to the limits of my ultimate destiny
Feeling as though Somebody were testing me
He who sees the end from the beginning of time
Check the prophetic sections of the pages
New York New York it's a hell of a town
The Bronx is up and I'm Brooklyn down
They don't know my name they only know my initials
Building bombs in the attic for elected officials
I quit my job I cut my hair
You tried to get slick you bust a little chuckle
You're gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle
Cause being as fly as me is something you never thought of
Like a buffalo soldier I'm broader than Broadway
I play my stereo loud it disturbs my neighbors
I want to enjoy the fruits of my labor
If you open the book then you will get your hand slapped
If you ask a question you will get the answer
Her breast I saw I reached I felt
I stay at home just like a hermit
Yes you got a boyfriend and indeed his name is Slick Nick
I ride around town cause my ride is fly
He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost
If your world was all black and if your world was all white
Then you wouldn't get much color out of life now right
Nicknamed Shamrock my name is not Shamus
Suckers try to bite they try to pursue it
Chinese eyes and Chinese suits
Met a girl at a party and I gave her my card
You know that it said Napoleon Bonaparte
They call me Mike D Joe Blow the Lover Man
Your face turns red as your glass of wine
You spilled on my lyrics as you wasted my time
Girl you should be with me you should drop that bum
With that big round butt of yours
I met this girl last night with a peculiar cackle
I laid the bait and then she took the tackle
Had too much to drink at the Red Lobster
Now the room is spinning around like the blades of a helicopter
I never met a girl that was too finicky
If the press has their way then they're going to finish me
You might know this but you've never been this see
If I ate spinach then I'd be called Spinach D
I shed light like cats shed fur
Ride around town like Raymond Burr
I'm so high that they call me Your Highness
If you don't know me then pardon my shyness
I live in the Village wherever I go I walk to
I play my music loud because you know it's got clout to it
Jazzy J. in the house
Bad Brains in the house
People How You Doing There's A New Day Dawning
For The Earth Mother It's A Brand New Morning
For Such A Long While There's Been Such A Longing
But Now The Sun Is Shining Let's Roll Back The Awning
This Is A Type Of Kinda Like A Formal Dedication
Giving Out A Shout For Much Inspiration
All I Ever Really Want To Do Is Get Nice
I Jump Up On The Stage And Take The Mic In My Hand
Bass From The Back Of My Car Feels Soothing
Eight Bazookas Is What I'm Using
I'm Mike D And It's Been Proven
Strapped On The Ear Goggles And What Did I See
If you can feel what I'm feeling then it's a musical masterpiece
But if you can hear what I'm dealing with then that's cool at least
What's running through my mind comes through in my walk
True feelings are shown from the way that I talk
In the place with the bass I'm going all the way
And if you think that you're slick you'll catch a brick y'all
Well on and on and on and on
I give thanks for inspiration
It guides my mind along the way
So this is what I've got to say to you all
Be true to yourself and you will never fall
I've been coming to where I am from the get go
Find that I can groove with the beat when I let go
So put your worries on hold
Get up and groove with the rhythm in your soul
Yes yes y'all and yes yes y'all
I'm always on time never the less y'all
I've got no time in my life to get uptight y'all
But time flies when you're having fun
You come and see me and you pay a fee
Do what I do professionally
To tell the truth I am exactly what I want to be
Let's rock this joint in the old school way
Well I'm on till the crack of dawn
I go off like nothing can phase me
But I can stand my ground and I am down
Good times gone and you missed them
Things they bounce like a Spalding
When you've got so much to say
It's called gratitude and that's right
Good times gone but you feed it
What you think that the world owes you
Look inside and you'll see
When you've got so much to say
Come on Mike let's tear it up
So many damn people are so damn full of it
Keyboard Money Mark you know he's not having it
Just give him some wood and he'll build you a cabinet
I'm convinced that Vince is ripping me off
I think it's his girdle that's tipping me off
Mike D's out back and he's growing onions
It's time to turn the page to a brand new chapter
Setting my sights and you know what I'm after
I'll be in the paper the news with Ernie Ernesto
They'll even print my recipe for pasta with pesto
Now here's another special of the day
I've got more spice than the frugal gourmet
Well Mike D what you got for me
Show these good people what it means to be D
Well they call me Mike D with the mad man style
Created a sound at which many were shocked at
I've got a million ideas that I ain't even rocked yet
I've got the light bulb flashing at the top of my head
Never wake up on the wrong side of the bed
With a point to make you're bound to take a stand
Got every type of flavor a style that will suit ya
You know the bass is real fat because it's gotta be like that
A snare on the funky tin and a taste of the high hat
I could catch a groove like a flash in the dark
Grab a hold of your attention like a thief in the park
I'll be switching up the rhythm like the rhyme's a piece of chewing gum
Now I might chew but I don't bite
My ideas are mine when I begin to write
Sporting the crazy funky threads that you've never even seen before
I won't scuff nor scuffle just grin as they walk by
Take time to rhyme for a girl I hear talk fly
Down some papaya down with the revolution
Gotta free the funky fish from the funky fish tanks
Well just plug me in just like I was Eddie Harris
Let it flow like a mudslide
When I get on I like to ride and glide
I got depth of perception in my text y'all
I get props at my mention cause I vex y'all
I get so funny with with the money that ya flaunt
Well it's whack when you're jacked in the back of a ride
Believe me what you see is what you get
But in the mean time I'm wise to the demise
I've got eyes in the back of my head so I realize
Well I'm doctor Spock I'm here to rock y'all
You suckers write me checks and then they bounce
So I reach into my pocket for the fresh amount
See I'm the long leaner Victor the Cleaner
I'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl a hot sauce
You got the rhyme and reason but got no cause
Well if you're hot to trot you think you're slicker than grease
It's time to set the record straight
Ain't nobody got to spell it for me
Ain't nobody got to yell I can see
Ain't nobody got the pain I can hear
But if I have to I'll yell in your ear
Ain't nobody to to spell it for me
I said ain't nobody got to yell I can see
I said ain't nobody got the pain I can hear
But if I have to I'll yell in your ear
And we ain't got no water
We don't have no water
No time for making up a monster to sell
I wish for peace between the races
There's something coming to the surface
There's fire all around
But this is all illusion
I've seen better days than this one
I've seen better nights than this one
Tension is rebuilding
Where the candlelight was just right
And the wine was delicious.
I don't see things quite the same as I used to
As I live my life I've got just me to be true to
And when I find that I don't know about just what to do
I turn and look within to see what I should do
Now I'm not sure what it takes to be hip
A lot of people making music that to me ain't shit
So I ask creation for rhymes for this jam
I see the light on my horizon's not fading away
Gonna shine from within like a bright white sun
No need to hide and no place to run
Got the vibrations of the music bringing light to your mind
So you can move and groove and feel the beat of time
Sense the power in the air as it starts to move
You get a real good feeling that you just can't lose
Free your mind it's time for good times
And let yourself move it's a time to shine
You're breaking through with no need to hide
I got the music coming come on take control of my soul
I can't hold back I've got to let go
Stand together people come together now
It's about time we got to get together now
Stand together people come together now
Stand together people come together now
Who is the man coming down your block
It's me you see with the funk in my walk
One thing you ought to know...
I feel like Rufus Thomas The crown prince of dance
I'm Mike D and I'm known for romance
And I'm riding down the block like I'm on a water slide
See I'm a player I play Don't play to win I play to show
Down with the sound so sweet y'all
Just how fresh can you get y'all
Those that are blessed say yes y'all
I'm a come inside and do my thing
I'm gonna take off my drawers and let myself swing
Tantalize my tummy with a boo boo snack
But now I got to get back
This one's for you and you and you
Gonna tell you motherfuckers why you ain't shit
When you're popping that bullshit all day long
I'm gonna bust my shoes I'm gonna bust my socks
I'm gonna spread my word from standing on this box
This drive through world it just ain't right
Gonna run to Joe and Tony's and get my hair cut nice
and let's work it out
I'm trying to get up So don't you get me down
Life I love you now give me a pound
Up from the frying pan into the fire
Look within and try to admire
Time to get up and go to work
I Ride On The Bus Into The City Everyday
I Sit On The Seat And I Dream Myself Away
I Dream I'm On An Island With That foxy lady too
But When I Awaken I Must Be Mistaken I'm On Third Avenue
Won't You Take Me Away And Take Away Me
I'm in the pocket just like Grady Tate
I got supplies of beats so you don't have to wait
But now I want y'all to move it
Put your point on the floor and just prove it
I've been through many times In which I thought I might lose it
The only thing that saved me Has always been music
We've got our own studio the son of the G
It's no question life's been good to me
A good mix tape to put you in the right mood
This one goes out to my man the Groove Merchant
Coming through with beats for which I've been searching
Like two sealed copies of expansions
The logo I sport is the face of the monkey
Union made Ben Davis quality it's no junk see
My chrome is shining just like an icicle
But one big oaf whose faker than plastic
A dictionary definition of the word spastic
You should have never started something That you couldn't finish
Thought you could walk on me co get some ground to walk on
I'll put the rug out under your ass as I talk on
I'll take you out like a sniper on a roof
But like the pencil to the paper I got more to come
One after another you can all get some
So you better take your time and meditate on your rhyme
And that's right y'all don't get uptight y'all
You can't say shit because you're biting what I write y'all
And that's wrong y'all over the long haul
A butterfly floats on the breeze of a sun lit day
As I feel this reality gently fade away
Riding on a thought to see where it's from
Gliding through a memory of a time yet to come
Swirling images through my mind
Like a whirlpool spin beginning to unwind
And I stand at the edge cautiously awaiting
Carefully navigating by the stars in the sky
And I think to myself
And on the horizon the sun light begins to climb
And it seems like it's been so long since he shined
But I'm sure it was only yesterday
A cold chill of fear cut through me
I felt my heart contract
To my mind I brought the image of light
And I expanded out of it
My fear was just a shadow
And then I voice spoke in my head
And she said dark is not the opposite of light
It's the absence of light
And I thought to myself
She knows what she's talking about
Pass the pass the pass the pass the pass the...
I give thanks I give I give I give...
So Mike D so Mike D Mike d...
Rock rock on rock on rock...
If you can feel what I'm feeling then it's a musical masterpiece
But if you can hear what I'm dealing with then that's cool at least
What's running through my mind comes through in my walk
True feelings are shown from the way that I talk
In the place with the bass I'm going all the way
And if you think that you're slick you'll catch a brick y'all
Well on and on and on and on
I give thanks for inspiration
It guides my mind along the way
So this is what I've got to say to you all
Be true to yourself and you will never fall
I've been coming to where I am from the get go
Find that I can groove with the beat when I let go
So put your worries on hold
Get up and groove with the rhythm in your soul
Yes yes y'all and yes yes y'all
I'm always on time never the less y'all
I've got no time in my life to get uptight y'all
But time flies when you're having fun
You come and see me and you pay a fee
Do what I do professionally
To tell the truth I am exactly what I want to be
Let's rock this joint in the old school way
Well I'm on till the crack of dawn
I go off like nothing can phase me
But I can stand my ground and I am down
There was two of these motherfuckers up here
I done took a picture with one already
Where that little bastard at that little bastard that took that other one
I got seven motherfucking minutes so you gotta make this quick
What you sham me for what's wrong
Yea you can't front on that
Did you go pass the leader on the cassette there
Alright everybody take one...
I'd like to tell everybody out there
This is a special song about that special someone
About just how special things can be you know
I'm sure everybody out there has gone
It can be the worst thing
It can make you feel great or...
Oh hey there Georgie girl
You can kiss that old crumb crack guy goodbye
I saw the other Girl at Netty's the other day
And she had her shit together
You got your shit together Georgie Girl
Yea you're looking so nice Georgie Girl

Like Dennis Coffey I'm a Scorpio
Butt naked beats with butt naked fills
I got the skills to pay the bills y'all
I don't sell bullets and I don't sell crack
Rub a little oil on my neck and back
The original young aboriginal
Continued evolution of an individual well I'll tell ya
Got so many rhymes ya know my throat is sore
It's 1992 and still no one to vote for
Well like my words is what I'm seeing through my own eyes
A little vision of the truth in a world of lies

No need to hide and no place to run

I can't hold back I've got to let go
Stand together people come together now
It's about time we got to get together now
Stand together people come together now
Stand together people come together now
Come on Mike let's tear it up
So many damn people are so damn full of it
Keyboard Money Mark you know he's not having it
Just give him some wood and he'll build you a cabinet
I'm convinced that Vince is ripping me off
I think it's his girdle that's tipping me off
Mike D's out back and he's growing onions
It's time to turn the page to a brand new chapter
Setting my sights and you know what I'm after
I'll be in the paper the news with Ernie Ernesto
They'll even print my recipe for pasta with pesto
Now here's another special of the day
I've got more spice than the frugal gourmet
Well Mike D what you got for me
Show these good people what it means to be D
Well they call me Mike D with the mad man style
Created a sound at which many were shocked at
I've got a million ideas that I ain't even rocked yet
I've got the light bulb flashing at the top of my head
Never wake up on the wrong side of the bed
With a point to make you're bound to take a stand
Got every type of flavor a style that will suit ya
You know the bass is real fat because it's gotta be like that
A snare on the funky tin and a taste of the high hat
I could catch a groove like a flash in the dark
Grab a hold of your attention like a thief in the park
I'll be switching up the rhythm like the rhyme's a piece of chewing gum
Now I might chew but I don't bite
My ideas are mine when I begin to write
Sporting the crazy funky threads that you've never even seen before
I won't scuff nor scuffle just grin as they walk by
Take time to rhyme for a girl I hear talk fly
Down some papaya down with the revolution
Gotta free the funky fish from the funky fish tanks
Good times gone and you missed them
Things they bounce like a Spalding
When you've got so much to say
It's called gratitude and that's right
Good times gone but you feed it
What you think that the world owes you
Look inside and you'll see
When you've got so much to say
Please Clear The Ice For The Zamboni
Couples Only For The Next Five Minutes Please
We're Having A Sale On New Blades At The Skate Shop
White People Only For The Next Five Minutes Please
People How You Doing There's A New Day Dawning
For The Earth Mother It's A Brand New Morning
For Such A Long While There's Been Such A Longing
But Now The Sun Is Shining Let's Roll Back The Awning
This Is A Type Of Kinda Like A Formal Dedication
Giving Out A Shout For Much Inspiration
All I Ever Really Want To Do Is Get Nice
I Jump Up On The Stage And Take The Mic In My Hand
Bass From The Back Of My Car Feels Soothing
Eight Bazookas Is What I'm Using
I'm Mike D And It's Been Proven
Strapped On The Ear Goggles And What Did I See
all the older ladies out there
but here's some sex rhymes for those that are horny
said I love ya won't leave ya so you got to listen
you're so lovely lengthy and so appealing
a sassy sophisticated sexy lady
well I'm 26 and you're 80
The clock is ticking so you better not front
we can go to my place or we could smoke a blunt
just turn down the lights so we can go farther
Because I saw ya at the check out line
you dropped your coupons and you were looking fine
sophisticated and so mature
I couldn't really care if you're 50 or 74
Because I want ya and I need ya
Mike D come on and rock the sure shot
And everything I do is funky like Lee Dorsey
Strictly hand held is the style I go
I strap on my ear goggles and I'm ready to go
To all the party people that are on my Balzac
I've got more action than my man John Woo
Ad Rock come and rock the sure shot
Fresh like Dougie when I get my specs and
On the microphone I come correct
Timing like a clock when I rock the hip hop
Top notch is my stock on the soapbox
I've got more rhymes than I've got gray hairs
And that's a lot because I've got my share
I've got a hole in my head and there's no one to fix it
On rock the microphone and then I'm gone
I want to say a little something that's long overdue
The disrespect to women has got to be through
To all the mothers and the sisters and the wives and friends
I want to offer my love and respect to the end
So I'm supposed to sit upon the couch watching my TV
Well I'm that kid in the corner
All fucked up and I wanna so I'm gonna
Think I'm gonna change up my style just to fit in
I keep my underwear up with a piece of elastic
To send my rhymes out to all the nations
Butcher me on the court
Too Many Elbows To Report
Now You're Poking Me In The Eye
Dribbling The Ball Like The Biz Can Be Bad
Box Me Out With Your Fat Ass
Throw Me Around Like A Bounce Pass
You've Got A Tombstone Hanging Over Your Dick
You cause A Minor Earthquake When You Throw A Moving Pick
Now let me introduce myself on this cut
I've got an old school flow like Mike McGill
Got fat bass lines like Russel Simmons steals money
I got my hair cut correct like Anthony Mason
Mike D with the vinyl and the grooves so rare
I'm gonna stick my dick in the mashed potatoes
I've been learner from the elders now it's time to speak
That shit sounds nice
Mike D come on and get it on y'all
Well I'm not known for my speed raps
So grab the microphone and cut out the claps
Just a little deranged
Legalize the weed and I'll say thank heavens
Pass me an iron and I'll bust a chip shot
I've got that funky fly golf gear from head to toe
I'm like sweetie pie by the stone alliance
Never let you down with the stereo sound
Come up representing from the upper west
Money Making putting me to the test
Sometimes I feel as though I've been blessed
Cause downtown Brooklyn is where I was born
You might think that I'm a fanatic
A phone call from Utah and I'm throwing a panic
So break it to the root when we kick it on down
Gonna kick it root down
Gonna kick it root down
Gonna kick it root down
I'm walking down your block and you say that's him
There goes the guy with the funky sound
Because I've got the flow where I grab my dick
The original nasal kid is doing damage
Every morning I took the train to High Street Station
Like Harlem World Battles on the Zulu Beat Show
Bob Marley was a prophet for the freedom fight
And no one can stop this flow from flowing on
For bringing me into this world and so on
Gonna kick it root down
Gonna kick it root down
Gonna rock it root down
I can't stand rocking when I'm in here
While you sit back and wonder why
You'll shut me down with a push of your button but yo
I'll tell you now I keep it on and on
And we can bet so don't you get souped yet
Scheming on a thing that's a mirage
I'm trying to tell you now it's sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Because I feel disgraced because you're all in my face
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel
I'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle
Listen to the shit because we kick it until dawn
Listen to the abstract got it going on
Listen to the ladies come on and let me spawn
All your eggs then you go up the river
And I can't stop with the body rock
See I've got heart like John Starks
I'm the M to the C to the A and it's a must
The rhymes that we bust on the topic of lust
Let me get down to the rhythm
Nobody's getting any bigger than this
Phone is ringing Oh my God
Listen to the shit because both of them is bony
Because she's the cheese and I'm the macaroni
So why all the fight and why all the fuss
I've got a grandma Hazel and a grandma Tilly
Born on the cusp in the month of November
I do the Patty Duke and in case you don't remember
Don't need a motherfucking fool telling me right from wrong
I don't think I'm slick nor do I play like I'm hard
But I shall drive the lane like I was Evan Bernhard
And I'm working on my game because life is taxing
Got to get it together and see what's happening
I go one two like my name was Biz Mark
But I had to do the shit just let me embark
On the lyric and the noun and the verb
My brain is roaming and I don't know where it's going
Talking lots of shit a little tweaking on the weekend
I've got to get him by the reigns because I know that I'm freaking
And when I get my flow I'm Dr. on the go
Because I had to talk about the times that I rhyme
Because I back them off with the quills
Praying mantis on the court and I can't be beat
Gonna get it together Ma Bell
Look Around And Listen And You'll See Every Sign
The Waters Are Polluted As The Forests Are Cut Down
Bombing And Drilling Deep Below the Ground
Check The Prophecies From Around The World
And Look Around Now As It All Unfurls
Look Into Yourself And See What Goes On
Get A Feeling In Your Heart Of The Right From Wrong
Because The Mother Earth Needs To Be Respected
Been Far From Too Long That She's Been Neglected
It's Like Cutting Off Your Nose To Spite Your Face
It's Clear That The Earth Was The One Who Lost
We Are One With Her As She Is One With Us
It's Unreal How She Is Treated So Unjust
As Our Planet Grows Smaller Each And Every Day
Everyone Affecting Everyone In Every Way
We're All Citizens Of The World Community
All Here Together And We're Searching For Unity
There Are Things I've Done That I Wouldn't Do Again
Yes The Storm Before The Calm And The Wars That Lead To Love
Things Must Run Their Course So We Push And We Shove
But We're Here To Work It Out In One Way Or Another
To Find A Mutual Respect For Ourselves And One Another
But The True Key Is A Trust In Self
I Want Everyone To See It's In The Palm Of Your Hand
But Right Here And Now Is Where It All Goes On
I Know We Can Fix It And It's Not Too Late
I Give Respect To King And His Nonviolent Ways
I Dream And I Hope And I Won't Forget
Someday I'm Going To Visit On A Free Tibet
Someday I'm Going To See Us All Joined As One
And It Would Be Too Bad To Blow It Up Before We're Done
The Love Behind The Tension Like The Sun Behind The Rain
I'm Sending Loving Light To All That Is
To All Creation And The Life We Live
Because I Grab The Microphone And I Pick It Up
And Then I Fuck It Up And Then I Turn It In
And Then You Know I'm Gonna Get Down And
I'm Sending This One Out To All The Funky Inspirations
Trying To Put What I Feel Into Word And Rhymes
Because I Drive Like A Maniac On The Streets
Right To Left And I'm Death Defying
Here's The Payback Keep Going Strong Like Since The Way Back
I Try To Be Myself But I Lose Track
As We Learn To Breed Love For One Another
In These Times Of Melding Cultures
I Give Respect For What's Been Borrowed And Lent
I Know This Music Comes Down From African Descent
Let Me Talk About Back Field In Motion
My Girls Got Cheeks For Weeks And I'm Happy
You Know I'm A Sneak Like My Old Grand Pappy
I Gotta Give Thanks To My Man Archie Sheep
For Staying True To Inspiration And I Don't Half Step
So I Kick Out The Jams And Tell You Who I Am
I Ask God For A Rhyme Or Two
A Little Something For The Wise As Well As The Fool
A Little Something To Affect A Little Taste Of Change
And Then I'm Rapping On The Mic To The Broadway Light
I Got A Match To My Ass And I'm A Keep It Lit
I'm Rushing Around Town Taking Care Of My Functions
Always Got One More Thing So Forget About Function
We Create This World And The Problems Go On
Off the tracks that I kick come on and give it up cause
I get funky like diaper rash and
I've got sex rhymes like Victoria got secrets
To all you porn peepers who are trying to peep this
Lead my team to sixty wins like my man Pat Ewing
Like a sound that goes the depths of the soul
A little wine with my dinner so I'm in my grape Ape
Dante found his shit and you know he freaked it
And so the story goes on and on
Like The Black Birds I'm A Do It Fluid
Step Inside The Mother Fucker And I Get My Flow On
Season's Change When It Comes Their Time
Falls Brings The Winter And On Back To Springtime
Listen All Of Y'all I'm Not The Son Of Sam

I'm A Souped Up Sucker And I'll See You All Later
You See Me Coming Down The Block With The Funky cuts
I've Got Attractions Like I'm Elvis Costello
Well When I Get It Into The Zone
I'm Gonna Take it To A Place Where It's All One
My Shit Is On And The Rhyme Style's Kicking
My Brain Is Flowing Honest Like Abe Lincoln
That You Savor So Watch Your Behavior
I've Got The Funky Rhymes But I'm Not The Funky Devil
Step From Stage To Stage To See It All Unwind
Slowly But Surely I Seek To Find My Mind
And Every Wall That I Face Is Ow My Own Design
Glendale Boulevard Is Where I'm At
Drink A Six Pack And Then You Play Some Ball
Walking Down The Stairs And Then He Starts To Fall
Add On Two Joints And Then He Starts To Sweat
Two Hundred Seventy Five Pounds That You Can't Forget
Spend All Your Money On Your Health Insurance Plan
Keep On Getting Bigger Because You Know That You Can
Why Do You Force Yourself On Top Of That Girl
Laugh With All Your Buddies Because It's A Man's Man's World
Someday That Shit Will Come Back To You
You've Been Throwing Your Weight Around And
Weighs In At Two Seventy Five
My Man Is Lucky To Be Alive
Got No God Damn Respect
Had To Put The Big Big Bitch In Check
Lungs Full Of Tar And A Stomach Full Of Spam
I Don't get Blind Most Of The Time I Don't Drink Wine
I Took A Sledge Hammer And I Broke My Nine
I'm Feeling Good When I Do It Like This
So Come On And Turn It Up Because You Can't Resist

I Seen You Hawking And Then You Clock My Style
And Then You Try To Play It Off Like You Think You're Wild
Don't Sit Around Waiting For Someone's Help
I Don't Sit Back And Say Good Enough
I'm Throwing Rhymes Kicking Them Downtown
Traveling High Speed Through The Underground
I've Got Shelves Of Rhymes That I Keep On File
I'm Feeling Good Now Back Home Again
New York City Is The City That I Feel At Home In
Stepping Into The Future Again
But My Life Is Getting Hectic Like A Smoke Bomb
You Put Yourself Down And You Don't Even See
And That Was Part Of The Key
Leave You Broke In A Comatose State Of Mind
I Keep My Rhymes In A Little Black Book
As I develop the awakened mind
I bow before you as I travel my path
For the sake of all beings I seek
The enlightened mind that I know I'll reap
I give thanks for this world as a place to learn
And for this human body that I know I've earned
And my deepest thanks to all sentient beings
For without them there would be no place to learn what I'm seeing
There's nothing here thats not been said before
But I put it down now so that I'll be sure
To solidify my own views
And I'll be glad if it helps anyone else out too
If others disrespect me and give my flack
I'll stop and think before I react
Knowing that they're going through insecure stages
I'll take the opportunity to exercise patience
I'll see it as a chance to help the other person
Nip it in the bud before it can worsen
A chance for me to be strong and sure
As I think on the Buddhas who have come before
As I praise and respect the good they've done
Knowing only love can conquer hate in every situation
We need other people in order to create
The circumstances for the learning that we're here to generate
Situations that bring up our deepest fears
So that we can work to release them until they've cleared
To thank our enemies despite their intent
The Bodhisattva path is one of power and strength
A strength from within to go the length
Seeing others are as important as myself
I strive for a happiness of mental wealth
With the interconnectedness that we share as one
Every action that we take affects everyone
So in deciding for what a situation calls
There is a path for the good of all
I try to make my every action for that highest good
So I pledge here before everyone who's listening
To make my every action for the good of all beings
For the rest of my lifetimes and
Even beyond I vow to do my best to do no harm
We dressed all in black
Can't you see this is an emergency
Can you feel the urgency
With the hold of democracy
In a state of emergency now
Let's just come and take unique
All across the stormy sea
Better days in democracy
In a state of emergency now
Cops just don't have respect to me
World is filled with tyranny
All across the stormy sea
Who the hell are we off to see
Let's just come and take unique
Friday night intimacy
Going out the family boar
Brad's off twisting a win
And I can't afford to pay the feds
And now I'm never late on Friday night
Don't hit fudging I'm
Fucking stupid roll up fight
Now I'd rather jump than pay
It's totally.. all the time
You ain't got nothing nothing to say
Why don't you just go away
You ain't got nothing to tell
Why don't you just go to hell
You ain't got nothing nothing in your head
Holy funky big fat rat
Robin's got a new bus pass
Robin's got a new bus pass
Holy funky big fat rat
Robin's got a new bus pass
Find a trail so that we can all feast on mighty might
I saw bureaucrat looking at me
The new Reagan policy is getting the best of me
The new Reagan policy is getting the best of me
Walking around late at night
Adjusting things in my sight
Everyone smokes a joint
Everyone's carrying a grudge
The new Reagan policy is getting the best of me
I saw bureaucrat looking at me
Walking around late at night
See the things in my sight
Oh shut up you pig fucker
Adam. you look like a zebra your mother's a zebra
Fuck the chickens I don't like milk
Fuck the chickens I don't like milk
Barnyard stoats raid the pen
Fuck the chickens I don't like milk
Fuck the chickens I don't like milk
I wish I could be satisfied
Fuck the chickens I don't like milk
Sees how much wheat will yield
Fuck the chickens I don't like milk
Barnyard stoats raid the pen
And everyday I'm going to school
I wish that I could find gratitude
Fuck the chickens I don't like milk
barnyard stoats raid the pen
Fuck the chickens I don't like milk
Fuck the chickens I don't like milk
Now me everyday I'm riding to school
I'm learning a bunch of brainwash
We dressed all in black
Friday night intimacy
Going out the family boar
Brad's off twisting a win
And I can't afford to pay the feds
And now I'm never late on Friday night
Don't hit fudging I'm
Fucking stupid roll up fight
Now I'd rather jump than pay
The shit with this bitch
Yo I said I'm calling you B.
These pussy crumbs are making me itch
Maybe I should scratch
We say we have mi Kate
The shit with this bitch
Yo I said I'm calling you B.
These pussy crumbs are making me itch
Maybe I should scratch
Deep inside you will find
Something that you won't mind
Think about diamond rings
Something passed that you lack
Well I've got brand new
Deep inside you will find
Something that you won't mind
Think about diamond rings
Something passed that you lack
Well I've got brand new
Rob and steal from the Health Food store
The ideas you shout that are so hardcore
Screaming at the phone man collecting the change
I won't say that life's a bitch and then you die
Because I will do my best to enjoy mine
You can't bring me down to a world of self pity
Lot's of ways to deal with it
You do unto others like they're pieces of shit
A righteous man who's flipping the script
There's plenty of room for everyone at the table
I won't live life being mad holding a grudge
It's not my place sitting back playing judge
Not enough time to always stay mad
May as well be glad to
And I thought it was knows
Something you don't have to tell me
Something you don't have to sell me
And what do I have to do
It's not for lack of trying
Too much coffee out of control
When he rides he rides the poll
White build up crazy twitch
Always in a rush to hit that switch
Moving too damn quick
You know where to find me anytime
I can't take it I've lost my mind
Proud to say no I'm not son
Too much action right by me
Like Buddy Rich try me
Need a brain that's stress resistant
When Brian Wilson used it
If only I could have imagined
The square waves running through his head
Electro magnetic fields
For all all of his brilliant innovation
Shit happens with the games you run
Never thought the day would come
Shit happens with the games you run
Even if it's a battle you won
The new day starts when today is done
I can't think straight
What you get is what you see
On the bus on the train
Can't explain like The Who
Now it's time to do the do
I can't think straight
On my couch with a pen
Can't control rhythm rhyme
Naked beats on the mind
I can't think straight
I give to this world till I've got nothing to give to
I give thanks to this world for the life that I've lived through
Stress gets in the way of the shit that we're doing
We'll bum rush the door if you don't let the whole crew in
Give me the chance and I will show you what I'm feeling
My mind's caught up in the Shit the man's dealing
Looking Ahead the next level we're gonna take it to
I guess I should be happy it's a day that we made it through
Dropped my Yen into the ticket machine
Just getting some noodles the place wasn't too clean
The man started swinging wild it was real ill fated
The time had come bum rush him out the door
We we're trying to help him out but he ended up kind of sore
You know that it will be untrue
You know that it will be a liar
La la la la la la la la...
Before we couldn't get much higher
Come on baby light my fire
Come on baby light my fire
The time of two is our own soul
No time to war in the mire
But darling we can only learn
While other people flail on fire
Come on baby light my fire
Come on baby light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Come on baby light my fire
Come on baby light my fire
I move the crowd to the break of break of dawn
Can't rock the house without the party people
There's no better or worse between you and me
I like pins and needles and words that sting
At the blink of an eye I will do my thing
It's like a needle in the cartridge when the record spins
Nothing sounds quite like an 8-0-8
Sometimes I like to brag sometimes I'm soft spoken
You can kiss my ass you funky boss
I'll be with the hammer and the nail at your door
Shouts to my peeps let me know if you feel something
I can give you all you need
A little beat for the rhythm and some words to read
Let me tell you now that's my favorite shit
And when I got a new rhyme I just say it
It's times like this when I just can't stop
Can't wind your body without the body rock
You got to have the dreams to make it all worthwhile
So as I take my time and realign
I wonder what it is I hope to find
Ad Rock with the New Edition
A slight distraction can get you paid
Now I bet you never knew I got the ill peripheral
In your home I'm cloned I'm on your headphones
I got weight on my shoulders and things on my mind
The sky is falling and I'm falling behind
So I synthesize sounds as I patch my brain
Insane mind games move quick like flames
So now I wonder how sometimes you never know
No time like the present to work shit out
That's what we going on and on and on about
No shame in my game just par for the path
I try to hone my craft because at hands the task
But I find I'm not playing with a full deck
All I wanna know is when is checkout time
So I could be in heaven with the rhythm rock rhyme
From the satellite dish to your joy stick
It's the night of the living cable box
Wires coming up from around the block
Remote control to change the station
But that won't change your situation
Have you seen what I mean
I'm the little gnome that's in your dreams
So I say this rhyme built by design
To take you beyond space and time
Said who is the man making diamonds out of coal
The man pushing buttons on remote control
Until your back's up against the wall
You never know yourself that much at all
So you've got to share your love with a friend
People mislead by their own illusion
We're all linked together like a chain reaction
But we all want to hold the remote control
Things get hectic quick
All of the sudden I'm in the thick
Too much drama all around
Sliding on down a hill
Sometimes in life seems to stall
So never be ungrateful y'all
So I got a little something for your pay per view
Like Don King I've got the crazy hairdo
We've got cameras on Mars on space patrol
Controlled on Earth by remote control
Like you got the right
What makes this world
I know you don't know
What makes this world
Like a flag at half mast as frames click fast
Not a thing will last as past is past
Like stacks of thoughts that got played and worn
Used over and over till they were tired and torn
Like a broken clock that can't tell time
Like a scorching blaze that burned the sand
Like a band that planned and planned and planned
And flew down like a raven in the dark of night
And brought it back to the nest singing microphone check
Like scheming on a plan that goes all wrong
You act like a diamond waiting to be set
As time goes by in this give and take
It's the imagery of technology
Is what you get is what you see
Don't worry your mind
When you give it your best
Let me get some action from the back section
We need body rocking not perfection
Let your back bone flip but don't slip a disc
Let your spine unwind just take a risk
I wanna do the freak until the break of dawn
We're getting down computer action
Do the robotic satisfaction
All of y'all get off the wall
Have a ball and get involved with
Came out rapping when I was born
You can't explain to people this type of mind frame
I'm fine like wine when I start to rap
Let me get some action from the back section
Mike D with the master plan
Packed like sardines in the tin
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
Ad Rock light up the place
And if you pull my card you pull the ace
And if you ask me turn up the bass
Got numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe it's because I'm so versatile
From the Hudson River out to the Nile
I'll run the marathon to the very last mile
People always say my style is wild
Coming from Uranus to check my style
Cast you off into exile
I like my sugar with coffee and cream
A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes
Another dimension new galaxy
Intergalactic planetary
We're from the family tree of old school hip hop
Kick off your shoes and relax your socks
The rhymes will spread just like a pox
Now when I wrote graffiti my name was Slop
Step from the table when I start to chop
I'm a lumber jack DJ Ad Rock
If you try to knock me you'll get mocked
I'll stir fry you in my wok
Like a pinch on the neck of Mr. Spock
Go by the name of the King Ad Rock
No limits to this style you know you can't lock it
But I've got the styles that are always in the pocket
Like a bird floating down on a New York breeze
Every thought in the mind is a planted seed
So watch the mind or the thoughts will stack
Before you know it they're boomeranging on back
I'm the king of Boggle there is none higher
Fools can't see me and that's how it is
And that's how I like it cause that's my biz
Time's an illusion as the moments race by
Too fast to really grasp though we may try
These thoughts that mislead and then multiply
Second by second and minute by minute
It's like lotto you gotta be in it to win it
So tell me what you need that you have got
Feeding on power will make your blood clot
It starts with the greed and then goes all wrong
That's why we can't all just get along
One equaling one together like a croquette
Whether we have or have not yet met
You're caught in a panic and it's rattled your brain
The selfish ways just can't maintain
But these are the breaks when you try to come fake
Don't come with the rhymes that you just half baked
I chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf
It's time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon
I jumped outside the house with my Walkman on
I get so hyped when I hear this song
It's gonna keep me happy like all day long
Don't grease my palm with your filthy cash
Multinationals spreading like a rash
I might stick around or I might be a fad
But I won't sell my songs for no TV ad
I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros
I'm scheming rhyme against reason like it was flow against know
But beyond the concepts and emotions that rise
To the interconnectedness that underlies
The lies upon lies have lost their meaning
The plies upon plies of consciousness that is being
Now every word that you heard that I said that you felt
Was put in place in the space as they were shuffled and dealt
I steal feels from reels but I pay my respects
Paying compliments and disses and deciphering affects
I give in and I win I try to never complain
Intentions venture to center and then they set the stage
But I'll remain sane making gain without pain
Staining trains with names and driving lanes to the refrain
And keep it positive as painstaking as it is
So like a cloud carries rain I'm gonna carry my rhyme
Coming like thunder with lightening timing
No hesitation in gestation of thoughts and plans
Ferment time like wine no ploys or scams
Like the islands dot the oceans in the endless seas
Ideas coming to me in answer to my pleas
Woke up this morning right out of a dream
Reached for my pen and pad because my mind was on a rhyme scheme
I'm going down like the rhythms on the winds of change
I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros
I'm like Toucan Sam when I follow my nose
His Holiness and all enlightened beings
I'll be the one who screams it on the microphone
I'll be the one who brings it inside your home
For Betty Williams and her friends I sing this song
And more ink from my pen and more tears from my eyes
Once again I'm all wrapped up in me
My best friend's my own worst enemy
Electricity and gravity
Oh my god now take a look at me
They got their wires all up in me
Is push and pull the way it's got to be
Once again I'm all wrapped up in me
My best friend's my own worst enemy
Electricity and gravity
Once again I'm all wrapped up in me
Once again I'm all wrapped up in me
Once again I'm all wrapped up in me
Once again I'm all wrapped up in me
And here we go again because it's been awhile
Do me a favor don't touch that dial
I rock from Manhattan to the Miracle Mile
My name's Mike D and I'm the ladies choice
I want to get next to you like Rose Royce
Y'all gather round to hear my golden voice
Cruising like a fan boat on the glade
He'll tweak your ass across the cross fade
So watch your back when he takes the stage
Or he'll send you off on a naked rampage
We be getting down with no delay
Sweet and sour like a tangerine
Mix Master Mike with the scratch routine
Always updated and in the know
The bass is booming from down below
Well my name is Ad Rock I'm a Scorpio
We be getting down with no delay
Mix Master cut faster
This all top secret and classified
It's all hypnotic and sanctified
Now we be getting stupid in your area
We causing all kinds of hysteria
My beats is sick like malaria
In the studio it's the place to be
To all the party people who are happy and free
With Mix Master Mike we're making history
We be getting down with no delay
Dear Alex and Marilyn
And in the Swiss Hall of Fame he goes in
My name plate medallion
Says never trust a Hal 9000
Check the horizontal hold and check the tint
Rise fallen fighters take your stance again
Don't think too much about the color of skin
Order in vegetarian sharks fin
Like Chuck D with the where you never been I'm in
I'm a long way from where I've been
Ooh my my I'm really not feeling it
So on your way out please take a mint
Got the studio to throw a craze in
Just add a little flange and phase in
And if I die notify the next of kin
What's pleasing to the eye
In the delusion of all my sight
Is not what I find when I reach into the light
I'm walking through time
Deluded as the next guy
Pretending and hoping to find
That distant peace of mind
It's not so simple as I try to wish
There is no other worthy quest
And the rhythm's on time to every word and rhyme
When it comes to keep it real I keep it really raw
At the risk of sounding crass I would like to mention
To usurp my prose you so and so
It's my primary bone of contention
I tell you everybody I've had it
With all these people with static
I'll go insane if it don't rain
I love it when you hit those switches
A curve ball's what my pitch is
I keep all five boroughs in stitches
It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex
Until you feel no pain inside your brain
All your worries are soothed by the sound effects
Listen everybody let's show improve
Don't let me begin about heroin
Living six feet deep just ain't the move
We're giving you soul power
I like it sweet and sour
When it comes to rhymes and beat designs
I'm at the control tower
Tell me what makes you so afraid
Of all those people you say you hate
Just give it one time for your mind
Clap tracks line the spaces places papers people stack
Back track through the minutes when the thoughts went insane
I pulled the picture off the cover and blew out the mind games
But I can say this is the plainness of the peace I've found
It's not the sorrow or the pity that we hope to dismantle
It's just the cast of past dice lighting both ends of the candles
Reunited in the times of such picturesque scenes
So I plan and I scheme and write it off on my taxes
It's times like these I'll just go with the decisions of the masses
And to the crowds who've come before with their profit massing ways
I took the greed that fucked it up and brought it down to today
With pain I stand sane and remain holding strong
Whilst all around me those who clowned me are now drowning by the throngs
It's illogical the actions that are typically displayed
A set back ain't all that much problem to invade
So I will glow like a lantern on a new moon night
I'll fight violence with these hands that weren't built to fight
But like a furnace burning coal my goals are bound to burn in flames
Whether achieved or dismantled by the agendas displayed
Something on the windowsill
Caught her eye and held her still
The cars pass by outside
Picture this now crystal clear
Nothing left to hold her here
And creeping up meanwhile
Something on the windowsill
Caught her eye and held her still
The cars pass by outside
Eyes open wide to see if I could fly
Eyes open wide to see if I could fly
Something on the windowsill
And when it comes to beats well I'm the rhythm ace
So what if I'm a ham and cheese on rye
I got to do my thing and that's no lie
Well ice is cold and fire is hot
A little shout to Ian and little Zoe
One can wonder why but can't deny
We'll never know unless we try
So tell me party people what's your zodiac sign
I went inside the deli and my man's like what
I write the songs that make the whole world suck
I need to break it down every chance I get
Automation circulation
This is for the people all around the nation
I got books with hooks and it looks like rain
I've got to keep my mind clear so I don't bust
If you got bad breath then maybe try Scope
And if you wash your ass you best use soap
People of the world you realize
We got to get together and harmonize
Ravers of the world unite
We're the scientists of sound
When lightning strikes best grab a ground
Got to get up to get down
I've got the terminator style with a touch of the tweak
I wear permanent press so I'm always creased
I'm a Scorpio so you know I'm very sexual
I call em crullers but you know they're called crawlers
To all the people in the Dead Sea

Black Ark International Branch presents
Coffin going around going around the town
They who want to control always lose control
They who wants everything always lose everything
They who want total control always lose control
Some always lose their soul for silver and gold
Silver and gold are by none
Was in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
And all that I reap is mine
Was in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
Lift up your cap and rise up and hap
He used to call himself mister Brown in Kingston town
He no longer miss the town
He not know that I miss the crown and missed the ground
I. N. R. I. Production that takes over France
With voodoo dance and science arts
Science machine and science dream
This is a living dream from the Beastly Brothers
To give you some beastly joys
So put on your beastly drawers
And show me a beastly pose
And what do you do when
Your man kills himself and
I need to show her that
But he looks like he might have some...
And bird and weird shit... fart sounds.
It's like a flag at half mast as frames click fast
Not a thing will las...
Got numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe it's because I'm so versatile
From the Hudson River out to the Nile
I'll run the marathon to the very last mile
People always say my style is wild
Coming from Uranus to check my style
Cast you off into exile
I like my sugar with coffee and cream
A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes
Another dimension new galaxy
Intergalactic planetary
We're from the family tree of old school hip hop
Kick off your shoes and relax your socks
The rhymes will spread just like a pox
Now when I wrote graffiti my name was Slop
Step from the table when I start to chop
I'm a lumber jack DJ Ad Rock
If you try to knock me you'll get mocked
I'll stir fry you in my wok
Like a pinch on the neck of Mr. Spock

Let me get some action from the back section
We need body rocking not perfection
Let your back bone flip but don't slip a disc
Let your spine unwind just take a risk
I wanna do the freak until the break of dawn
We're getting down computer action
Do the robotic satisfaction
All of y'all get off the wall
Have a ball and get involved with
Came out rapping when I was born
You can't explain to people this type of mind frame
I'm fine like wine when I start to rap
Let me get some action from the back section
Mike D with the master plan
Packed like sardines in the tin
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
Ad Rock light up the place
And if you pull my card you pull the ace
And if you ask me turn up the bass
No limits to this style you know you can't lock it
But I've got the styles that are always in the pocket
Like a bird floating down on a New York breeze
Every thought in the mind is a planted seed
So watch the mind or the thoughts will stack
Before you know it they're boomeranging on back
I'm the king of Boggle there is none higher
Fools can't see me and that's how it is
And that's how I like it cause that's my biz
Time's an illusion as the moments race by
Too fast to really grasp though we may try
These thoughts that mislead and then multiply
Second by second and minute by minute
It's like lotto you gotta be in it to win it
So tell me what you need that you have got
Feeding on power will make your blood clot
It starts with the greed and then goes all wrong
That's why we can't all just get along
One equaling one together like a croquette
Whether we have or have not yet met
You're caught in a panic and it's rattled your brain
The selfish ways just can't maintain
But these are the breaks when you try to come fake
Don't come with the rhymes that you just half baked
I chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf
It's time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon
I jumped outside the house with my Walkman on
I get so hyped when I hear this song
It's gonna keep me happy like all day long
Don't grease my palm with your filthy cash
Multinationals spreading like a rash
I might stick around or I might be a fad
But I won't sell my songs for no TV ad
Like stacks of thoughts
Till they were tired and torn
No I think it'll be fun and fine.
In that special place again. Oh I'm so happy to be in that special place again.
And the rhythm's on time to every word and rhyme
When it comes to keep it real I keep it really raw
At the risk of sounding crass I would like to mention
To usurp my prose you so and so
It's my primary bone of contention
I tell you everybody I've had it
With all these people with static

We're giving you soul power
I like it sweet and sour
When it comes to rhymes and beat designs
I'm at the control tower
Tell me what makes you so afraid
Of all those people you say you hate
Just give it one time for your mind
But we gonna do it a little something like this
When it comes to books with rhymes within
Packed like sardines in a tin
Let me get some action from the back section
We need body rocking not perfection
Let your back bone flip but don't slip a disc
Let your spine unwind just take a risk
I wanna do the freak until the break of dawn
We're getting down computer action
Do the robotic satisfaction
All of y'all get off the wall

Ad Rock light up the place
And if you pull my card you pull the ace
And if you ask me turn up the bass
Can't you see this is an emergency
Can you feel the urgency
With the hold of democracy
In a state of emergency now
Let's just come and take unique
All across the stormy sea
Better days in democracy
In a state of emergency now
Cops just don't have respect to me
World is filled with tyranny
All across the stormy sea
Who the hell are we off to see
Let's just come and take unique
Not like a fever not like a cold
So don't see a doctor or see a nurse
It's time to party so have a ball
White Castle fries only come in one size
What you see is what you get
And you ain't seen nothing yet
I do not sing but I make a Def song
You could live your whole life and I hope you live long
On the Gong Show we won't get gonged
We don't only rock the house but we'll house the rock
We don't stroll but we roll straight to the top
And we can do it like this in the place to be
Cash on delivery like a COD
The beat is slow in order to dance
First you move your legs and then your arms
It's truly stable and you ought to be able
To dance to the record when it's on the turntable
Now I rock a house party at the drop of a hat
And I beat a body down with an aluminum bat
They'll be staring at the radio staying up all night
I got a boat to eat shrimp in
Routines I bust and the rhymes that I write
And I'll be busting routines and rhymes all night
Like eating burgers and chicken and you'll be picking your nose
You heard my style I think you missed the point
What's up with your bad breath onion rings
Hurricane you got clout
A puppet on a string I'm paid to sing or rhyme
In a lava lamp inside my brain hotel
Got more rhymes than Jamaicans got mangoes
I got the peg leg at the end of my stump
And if you don't believe us you should question your belief Keith
I'm like Sam the butcher bringing Alice the meat
In the back of the ride and bust with the whippet
My style was wild and you know that it still is
Disco bag schlepping and you're doing the bump
Good times gone and you missed them
Things they bounce like a Spalding
When you've got so much to say
It's called gratitude and that's right
Good times gone but you feed it
What you think that the world owes you
Look inside and you'll see
When you've got so much to say
I've got the skills to pay the bills y'all
I got the got the got the skills to pay the bills
I've got the skills to pay the bills
The time has come so I'm going to rap this
You Rip Van Winkle now you're gonna wake up
On the stage I'm known to break fool
I'm on a crazy mission to wax Bob Mack shit
I'm make you pay for the rhymes I take
I'm selling sex rhymes by the pound
My the skills to pay the bills
I got the got the got the skills to pay the bills
I got the got the got the skills to pay the bills
I got the skills to pay the bills y'all
So it better pull through when it comes to me
Let it go down like it's supposed to be
Words together like birds in a flock
I fucked around and then I lost my tooth
Like Dennis Coffey I'm a Scorpio
Butt naked beats with butt naked fills
I got the skills to pay the bills y'all
I don't sell bullets and I don't sell crack
Rub a little oil on my neck and back
The original young aboriginal
Continued evolution of an individual well I'll tell ya
Got so many rhymes ya know my throat is sore
It's 1992 and still no one to vote for
Well like my words is what I'm seeing through my own eyes
A little vision of the truth in a world of lies
When it comes to coming off I like to get my fill
Well I got the skills
I got the skills to pay the bills y'all
I got the got the got the skills to pay the bills
We got the mack skills in 92 boy
Yeah you know what I'm saying
Skills... to pay the bills
Skills y'all skills y'all to pay the bills
What skills money money
What skills y'all gotta pay the bills
Mario C he's paid the bills
Mike D you know I pay the bills
I'm like sweetie pie by the stone alliance
Never let you down with the stereo sound
Come up representing from the upper west
Money Making putting me to the test
Sometimes I feel as though I've been blessed
Cause downtown Brooklyn is where I was born
You might think that I'm a fanatic
A phone call from Utah and I'm throwing a panic
So break it to the root when we kick it on down
Gonna kick it root down
Gonna kick it root down
Gonna kick it root down
I'm walking down your block and you say that's him
There goes the guy with the funky sound
Because I've got the flow where I grab my dick
The original nasal kid is doing damage
Every morning I took the train to High Street Station
Like Harlem World Battles on the Zulu Beat Show
Bob Marley was a prophet for the freedom fight
And no one can stop this flow from flowing on
For bringing me into this world and so on
Gonna kick it root down
Gonna kick it root down
Gonna rock it root down
And I thought it was knows
Something you don't have to tell me
Something you don't have to sell me
And what do I have to do
It's not for lack of trying
Mike D come on and rock the sure shot
And everything I do is funky like Lee Dorsey
Strictly hand held is the style I go
I strap on my ear goggles and I'm ready to go
To all the party people that are on my Balzac
I've got more action than my man John Woo
Ad Rock come and rock the sure shot
Fresh like Dougie when I get my specs and
On the microphone I come correct
Timing like a clock when I rock the hip hop
Top notch is my stock on the soapbox
I've got more rhymes than I've got gray hairs
And that's a lot because I've got my share
I've got a hole in my head and there's no one to fix it
On rock the microphone and then I'm gone
I want to say a little something that's long overdue
The disrespect to women has got to be through
To all the mothers and the sisters and the wives and friends
I want to offer my love and respect to the end
So I'm supposed to sit upon the couch watching my TV
Well I'm that kid in the corner
All fucked up and I wanna so I'm gonna
Think I'm gonna change up my style just to fit in
I keep my underwear up with a piece of elastic
To send my rhymes out to all the nations
Let me get some action from the back section
We need body rocking not perfection
Let your back bone flip but don't slip a disc
Let your spine unwind just take a risk
I wanna do the freak until the break of dawn
We're getting down computer action
Do the robotic satisfaction
All of y'all get off the wall
Have a ball and get involved with
Came out rapping when I was born
You can't explain to people this type of mind frame
I'm fine like wine when I start to rap
Let me get some action from the back section
Mike D with the master plan
Packed like sardines in the tin
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
Ad Rock light up the place
And if you pull my card you pull the ace
And if you ask me turn up the bass
all the older ladies out there
but here's some sex rhymes for those that are horny
said I love ya won't leave ya so you got to listen
you're so lovely lengthy and so appealing
a sassy sophisticated sexy lady
well I'm 26 and you're 80
The clock is ticking so you better not front
we can go to my place or we could smoke a blunt
just turn down the lights so we can go farther
Because I saw ya at the check out line
you dropped your coupons and you were looking fine
sophisticated and so mature
I couldn't really care if you're 50 or 74
Because I want ya and I need ya
You missed two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kinda jerk
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag
Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
Read those boys the news
Read those boys the news
Read those boys the news
Read those boys the news
If you can feel what I'm feeling then it's a musical masterpiece
But if you can hear what I'm dealing with then that's cool at least
What's running through my mind comes through in my walk
True feelings are shown from the way that I talk
In the place with the bass I'm going all the way
And if you think that you're slick you'll catch a brick y'all
Well on and on and on and on
I give thanks for inspiration
It guides my mind along the way
So this is what I've got to say to you all
Be true to yourself and you will never fall
I've been coming to where I am from the get go
Find that I can groove with the beat when I let go
So put your worries on hold
Get up and groove with the rhythm in your soul
Yes yes y'all and yes yes y'all
I'm always on time never the less y'all
I've got no time in my life to get uptight y'all
But time flies when you're having fun
You come and see me and you pay a fee
Do what I do professionally
To tell the truth I am exactly what I want to be
Let's rock this joint in the old school way
Well I'm on till the crack of dawn
I go off like nothing can phase me
But I can stand my ground and I am down
I wish for peace between the races
There's something coming to the surface
There's fire all around
But this is all illusion
I've seen better days than this one
I've seen better nights than this one
Tension is rebuilding
As I develop the awakened mind
I bow before you as I travel my path
For the sake of all beings I seek
The enlightened mind that I know I'll reap
I give thanks for this world as a place to learn
And for this human body that I know I've earned
And my deepest thanks to all sentient beings
For without them there would be no place to learn what I'm seeing
There's nothing here thats not been said before
But I put it down now so that I'll be sure
To solidify my own views
And I'll be glad if it helps anyone else out too
If others disrespect me and give my flack
I'll stop and think before I react
Knowing that they're going through insecure stages
I'll take the opportunity to exercise patience
I'll see it as a chance to help the other person
Nip it in the bud before it can worsen
A chance for me to be strong and sure
As I think on the Buddhas who have come before
As I praise and respect the good they've done
Knowing only love can conquer hate in every situation
We need other people in order to create
The circumstances for the learning that we're here to generate
Situations that bring up our deepest fears
So that we can work to release them until they've cleared
To thank our enemies despite their intent
The Bodhisattva path is one of power and strength
A strength from within to go the length
Seeing others are as important as myself
I strive for a happiness of mental wealth
With the interconnectedness that we share as one
Every action that we take affects everyone
So in deciding for what a situation calls
There is a path for the good of all
I try to make my every action for that highest good
So I pledge here before everyone who's listening
To make my every action for the good of all beings
For the rest of my lifetimes and
Even beyond I vow to do my best to do no harm
Like you got the right
What makes this world
I know you don't know
What makes this world
Dropped my Yen into the ticket machine
Just getting some noodles the place wasn't too clean
The man started swinging wild it was real ill fated
The time had come bum rush him out the door
We we're trying to help him out but he ended up kind of sore
I have never been more ready in my entire life to do this right now
It's all been leading up to this moment
We've got rhyme selection in a wide array
I use the microphone like Picasso used clay
Down with freckles from around the bay
I give it my best to say come what may
I'm looking sideways like my man Pele
So fed up with racism today
Time to speak up and not turn away
Make the sun shine when it's cloudy and gray
Open up your ears and clean out your eyes
If you learn to love you're in for a surprise
It could be nice to be alive
Created a monster with these rhymes I write
Goatee metal rap please say goodnight
Now here's a little song that you might not like
It's a real pity that you people gotta bite
Try to keep clear of that hate and spite
So I keep my mind still like the still of night
Now who in the world do you want to fight
It's against the system that we should unite
If you learn to love then you might love life
Open up your ears and clean out your eyes
If you learn to love you're in for a surprise
It could be nice to be alive
Bringing back that old New York Rap
Now you can shuffle numbers but facts is facts
So many billionaires while so many lack
So before the poor decides to react
Come on party people and share up your stack
Do the Biz Mark dance and the cabbage patch
You try to turn the key but you broke the latch
Sneak into my files for some rhymes to snatch
I'd like to have a say on the income tax
Don't want to help build bombs and that's the fact
No money for health care so what's the catch
The man got you locked with no key to the latch
Mike and Adam have got my back
Open up your ears and clean out your eyes
If you learn to love you're in for a surprise
People How You Doing There's A New Day Dawning
For The Earth Mother It's A Brand New Morning
For Such A Long While There's Been Such A Longing
But Now The Sun Is Shining Let's Roll Back The Awning
This Is A Type Of Kinda Like A Formal Dedication
Giving Out A Shout For Much Inspiration
All I Ever Really Want To Do Is Get Nice
I Jump Up On The Stage And Take The Mic In My Hand
Bass From The Back Of My Car Feels Soothing
Eight Bazookas Is What I'm Using
I'm Mike D And It's Been Proven
Strapped On The Ear Goggles And What Did I See
Here we go again because it's been awhile
Do me a favor don't touch that dial
I rock from Manhattan to the Miracle Mile
My name's Mike D and I'm the ladies choice
I want to get next to you like Rose Royce
Y'all gather round to hear my golden voice
Cruising like a fan boat on the glade
He'll tweak ass your ass across the cross fade
So watch your back when he takes the stage
Or he'll send you off on a naked rampage
We be getting down with no delay
Sweet and sour like a tangerine
Mix Master Mike with the scratch routine
Always updated and in the know
You know we break it down going toe to toe
The bass is booming from down below
I'm known to mop I'm known to glow
We be getting down with no delay
Mix Master cut faster
All top secret and classified
It's all hypnotic and sanctified
I never wanna let a bad day slip by
We be getting stupid in your area
Causing all kinds of hysteria
My beats is sick like malaria
But don't worry I'll take care of ya
Me and Adam Adam and Mario C
When we're in the studio it's the place to be
To all beings everywhere be happy and free
With Mix Master Mike we're making history
We be getting down with no delay
I can't stand rocking when I'm in here
While you sit back and wonder why
You'll shut me down with a push of your button but yo
I'll tell you now I keep it on and on
And we can bet so don't you get souped yet
Scheming on a thing that's a mirage
I'm trying to tell you now it's sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Because I feel disgraced because you're all in my face
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel
I'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle
Riddle me this brother can you handle it
Your style to my style you can't hold a candle to it
Equinox symmetry and the balance is right
It's not how you play the game it's how you win it
I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic
For those about to rock we salute you
The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to
I once was lost but now I'm found
The music washes over and you're one with the sound
And the man upstairs I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire
Only 24 hours in a day
Music for all and not just one people
More Adidas sneakers than a plumber got pliers
If not for my vices and my bugged out desires
My year would be good just like Goodyear's tires
I mix business with pleasure way too much
I don't get blue I gotta mean red streak
You don't pay the band your friends and that's weak
Get even like Steven like pulling a Rambo
Steal from the rich and I'm out robbing banks
Give it to the poor and I always give thanks
I hold the title and you are the challenger
I've got money like Charles Dickens
Always go out dapper like Harry S. Truman
Smoke the holy chalice got my own religion
Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians
Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born
And the man upstairs I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire
Amps and crossovers under my rear hood
Got this dance that's more than real
Drink Brass Monkey here's how you feel
Tilt your head back let's finish the cup
Wherever we go with bring the Monkey with us
Double R. foots the bill most definitely
I drink Brass Monkey and I rock well
I got a castle in Brooklyn that's where I dwell
When it's time to get ill I pour it on my face
Monkey tastes Def when you pour it on ice
Come on y'all it's time to get nice
This girl walked by she gave me the eye
I reached in the locker grabbed the Spanish Fly
I put it with the Monkey mixed it in the cup
It did begin the stuff wore in and now she's on my tip
Step up to the bar put the girl down
She takes a big gulp and slaps it around
We had a case in the place and we went right through it
You got a dry martini thinking you're cool
And if you got beef you'll get beat to a pulp
The song and dance keeping you in a trance
If you don't buy my record I got my advance
I love Brass Monkey but I won't give D. it
We got the bottle you got the cup
It's time to set the record straight
Ain't nobody got to spell it for me
Ain't nobody got to yell I can see
Ain't nobody got the pain I can hear
But if I have to I'll yell in your ear
Ain't nobody to to spell it for me
I said ain't nobody got to yell I can see
I said ain't nobody got the pain I can hear
But if I have to I'll yell in your ear
And we ain't got no water
We don't have no water
No time for making up a monster to sell

So Mike D so Mike D Mike d...
Rock rock on rock on rock...
The spotlight's hitting something
That has known to change the weather
You know I read it in a magazine
But Bennie makes them ageless
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong
You know I read it in a magazine
And the rhythm's on time to every word and rhyme
When it comes to keep it real I keep it really raw
At the risk of sounding crass I would like to mention
To usurp my prose you so and so
It's my primary bone of contention
I tell you everybody I've had it
With all these people with static
I'll go insane if it don't rain
I love it when you hit those switches
A curve ball's what my pitch is
I keep all five boroughs in stitches
It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex
Until you feel no pain inside your brain
All your worries are soothed by the sound effects
Listen everybody let's show improve
Don't let me begin about heroin
Living six feet deep just ain't the move
We're giving you soul power
I like it sweet and sour
When it comes to rhymes and beat designs
I'm at the control tower
Tell me what makes you so afraid
Of all those people you say you hate
Just give it one time for your mind
I give to this world till I've got nothing to give to
I give thanks to this world for the life that I've lived through
Stress gets in the way of the shit that we're doing
We'll bum rush the door if you don't let the whole crew in
Give me the chance and I will show you what I'm feeling
My mind's caught up in the Shit the man's dealing
Looking Ahead the next level we're gonna take it to
I guess I should be happy it's a day that we made it through
There's no confusion in her conclusion
She wants to waste my time and that's no delusion
Her final decision is perfection and precision
She's grade A class number one in her division
She acts like a nag I don't know how it started
It's gets annoying so high on the tip
If a pirate had a Def Jam shirt she'd be hard on his ship
She'll do what's best just to reach the top
She studies real hard all night she'll cram
In school she majors in advanced Def Jam
She's cold in the winter and cool like ice
Sometimes she gets loose sometimes she gets nice
Her bedroom eyes they start to twitch
She'd drop to her knees if I'd only say please
Instead of counting sheep cold counting Beasties
Listen to the shit because we kick it until dawn
Listen to the abstract got it going on
Listen to the ladies come on and let me spawn
All your eggs then you go up the river
And I can't stop with the body rock
See I've got heart like John Starks
I'm the M to the C to the A and it's a must
The rhymes that we bust on the topic of lust
Let me get down to the rhythm
Nobody's getting any bigger than this
Phone is ringing Oh my God
Listen to the shit because both of them is bony
Because she's the cheese and I'm the macaroni
So why all the fight and why all the fuss
I've got a grandma Hazel and a grandma Tilly
Born on the cusp in the month of November
I do the Patty Duke and in case you don't remember
Don't need a motherfucking fool telling me right from wrong
I don't think I'm slick nor do I play like I'm hard
But I shall drive the lane like I was Evan Bernhard
And I'm working on my game because life is taxing
Got to get it together and see what's happening
I go one two like my name was Biz Mark
But I had to do the shit just let me embark
On the lyric and the noun and the verb
My brain is roaming and I don't know where it's going
Talking lots of shit a little tweaking on the weekend
I've got to get him by the reigns because I know that I'm freaking
And when I get my flow I'm Dr. on the go
Because I had to talk about the times that I rhyme
Because I back them off with the quills
Praying mantis on the court and I can't be beat
Gonna get it together Ma Bell
From the satellite dish to your joy stick
It's the night of the living cable box
Wires coming up from around the block
Remote control to change the station
But that won't change your situation
Have you seen what I mean
I'm the little gnome that's in your dreams
So I say this rhyme built by design
To take you beyond space and time
Said who is the man making diamonds out of coal
The man pushing buttons on remote control
Until your back's up against the wall
You never know yourself that much at all
So you've got to share your love with a friend
People mislead by their own illusion
We're all linked together like a chain reaction
But we all want to hold the remote control
Things get hectic quick
All of the sudden I'm in the thick
Too much drama all around
Sliding on down a hill
Sometimes in life seems to stall
So never be ungrateful y'all
So I got a little something for your pay per view
Like Don King I've got the crazy hairdo
We've got cameras on Mars on space patrol
Controlled on Earth by remote control
Setting out discovering the West
Johnny he worked on a railroad
The only sure things his next meal
Not knowing where they're going
But now he's in the West
She said please don't go
But he said if I don't I'll never rest
It wasn't always easy
Some of the boys died
Johnny wrote her letters
But received no replies
Johnny he worked on a railroad
The only sure things his next meal
Tired and broke without a dime
Started panning for gold
Trying to send his mama something
With the letters he was signing
Then one day Johnny finally got a reply
When he opened mama's letter
And this is what she said
Johnny he worked on a railroad
I know where you got to be going but you don't know why
I see things I ought not to know but I can't help life
You never knew my heart for you was monster size
Let me know if you want to check out for the all time high
My man told me long hellos and short goodbyes
But you are something else I love you please don't die
Well just plug me in just like I was Eddie Harris
Let it flow like a mudslide
When I get on I like to ride and glide
I got depth of perception in my text y'all
I get props at my mention cause I vex y'all
I get so funny with with the money that ya flaunt
Well it's whack when you're jacked in the back of a ride
Believe me what you see is what you get
But in the mean time I'm wise to the demise
I've got eyes in the back of my head so I realize
Well I'm doctor Spock I'm here to rock y'all
You suckers write me checks and then they bounce
So I reach into my pocket for the fresh amount
See I'm the long leaner Victor the Cleaner
I'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl a hot sauce
You got the rhyme and reason but got no cause
Well if you're hot to trot you think you're slicker than grease
Did you go pass the leader on the cassette there
Alright everybody take one...
I'd like to tell everybody out there
This is a special song about that special someone
About just how special things can be you know
I'm sure everybody out there has gone
It can be the worst thing
It can make you feel great or...
Oh hey there Georgie girl
You can kiss that old crumb crack guy goodbye
I saw the other Girl at Netty's the other day
And she had her shit together
You got your shit together Georgie Girl
Yea you're looking so nice Georgie Girl
Georgie Girl you know you're
Yea that's right baby that was you the first time
You know i saw you all alone
I was on the boardwalk you know
You was squirting the water in the clowns mouth and everything
But hey baby you know I would win the whole prize for you
I think this album will help keep the creative energies flowing
We dressed all in black
There never was a city kid truer and bluer
There's more to me than you'll ever know
Words are flowing out just like the Grand Canyon
And I'm always out looking for a female companion
I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib
I took off her moccasins and put on my bib
I'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peeling
Your body's on time and your mind is appealing
Staring at the cracks up there upon the ceiling
Such and such will be the bass that I'm throwing
I'm telling her every lie that you know that I never did
Me in the corner with a good looking daughter
The gift of gab is the gift that I have
And that girl ain't nothing but a drag
I'm Adam and I'm adamant about living large
I've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside
Ladies flock like bees to a hive
Hey hey hey hey ladies
Hey hey hey hey ladies
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey ladies
She'll show you a good time and then she'll show you the door
I threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed
Take my advice at any price
Sucking down pints till I didn't know
Woke up in the morning with the One Ton Ho
With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce
Girls with curls and big long locks
And beatnik chicks just wearing their smocks
Walking high and mighty like she's number one
Hey hey hey hey ladies
Got numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe it's because I'm so versatile
From the Hudson River out to the Nile
I'll run the marathon to the very last mile
People always say my style is wild
Coming from Uranus to check my style
Cast you off into exile
I like my sugar with coffee and cream
A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes
Another dimension new galaxy
Intergalactic planetary
We're from the family tree of old school hip hop
Kick off your shoes and relax your socks
The rhymes will spread just like a pox
Now when I wrote graffiti my name was Slop
Step from the table when I start to chop
I'm a lumber jack DJ Ad Rock
If you try to knock me you'll get mocked
I'll stir fry you in my wok
Like a pinch on the neck of Mr. Spock
Yes people that you knew at Elaine's
Well the story of your latest success
Had to turn the party out
You had to open up your mouth
Always got the piece of crowd
You had to have a white hot spotlight
And the people that you knew at Elaine's
And the stories of your latest success
Well I'm not sure what you said last night
No I'm not sure that you want to know
Well here's one hint honey
You sure did put on a show
Had to go and please the crowd
Always turned the party out
Just to open up your mouth
Grab your backstreet friend and get loud
I'll snatch you up with the needle nose pliers
With the ill boat you've never seen before
Gliding in the glades
Not goofy like Darren or Hazel
I'm a motherfucking Nick at Night
With classics rerunning that you know all right
I've got friends and family that I respect
So believe when I say I'm no better than you
Like that y'all and you just don't stop
Guaranteed to make your body rock
Let's turn this mother fucking party out
I'm a man that's on a mission
Method of controlling my mind
I didn't know you go for that mass appeal
I add up like a mathematician
I wear cotton but I don't wear deer
In the whip I'm gonna cruise past ya
Put that shit back on the shelf
You're out of phase and
I don't wear a cup nor a jock
I bring the shit that's beyond bizarre
You look Cable Guy dunked off of your crown
I flow like smoke out a chimney
But what you're making ain't hip hop B
Get your clothes right out the dryer.
Put Armor All up on your tire
Ready to throw a craze
With the sound delight we rock all night
And yes we're gonna party for the right to fight
Still around the way is where we'll stay
Trajectories from the past are taking their toll and
What we do now is future molding
We need a bit more gun controlling
I'm like the beach in the Bahamas make you feel alright
I'm getting kind of tired of the situation
The US attacking other nations
And narrations on every station
False election's got me losing my patience
And yes I got to say fuck the KKK
If you want to set it off then let me hear you say
I went to get a loan and they asked my race
I wrote down human inside the space
It's a disgrace how they try to debase
It ain't the bank's damn business how my lineage trace
Now let me drop a verse that's terse and concise
I'm an iron chef when I slice and dice
So please pass me the Reunite on ice
Keep the mind alert and not revert
Used to ride the D to beat the morning bell
At Edward R. Murrow out on Avenue L.
We're the super elastic bubble plastic
Got ethereal material that's straight up classic
You try to vex reject but you should respect
So don't start to flex up in the discotheque
We're gonna rock this motherfucker
We're gonna rock this motherfucker
We're gonna rock this motherfucker
I can see that Def Jam doesn't recognize me
Not 5 not 4 not 2 just 3
We're gonna rock this motherfucker
We're gonna rock this motherfucker
We're gonna rock this motherfucker
So if you're slick with the tricks and the sleight of hand
I'm hip to the shit that you're trying to scam
I'm an exceptional professional that just don't stop
We're gonna rock this motherfucker
We're gonna rock this motherfucker
We're gonna rock this motherfucker
If you don't like the news then press eject
Baby Davis getting older can't take a rain check
Hold up wait up you know we come correct
It's easier to sit back than stick out your neck
It's easier to break things than build it correct
We've got a president we didn't elect
The Kyoto treaty he decided to neglect
And still the US just wants to flex
It takes time to build
It takes time to build
Hate filled people wanna keep us in check
If you want love well hey that's a bet
We've got to give before we can get
Waiting like a batter who is on deck
When it's time to wreck shop then shop I'll wreck
So let's calibrate and check our specs
We need a little shift on over to the left
I don't really know but I suspect
I think it's due time that we inspect
How they get their information and their facts are checked
Another press conference someone's talking out their neck
It takes time to build
It takes time to build
So step up to the window and place your bets
Is the US gonna keep breaking necks
Maybe it's time that we impeach Tex
And the military muscle that he wants to flex
Environmental destruction and the national debt
But plenty of dollars left in the fat war chest
What the real deal why you can't connect
Why you hating people that you never met
It takes time to build
It takes time to build
When I rock the crowd the crowd we all yell
And when I get the feeling I feel the feel swell
And when I start to rhyme well I rhyme the rhyme well
Oh you didn't know I got the flow
I bought my grandma a brand new broach
When I rock the crowd I rock the crowd well
And when I get the feeling I feel the feel swell
I'll take you to task everyone of y'all draftsman
Well I'm Mike D with a story to tell
And when I rock the crowd the crowd we all yell
And when I get the feeling I feel the feel swell
Went to the top and never went pop and
Came back down but still not stopping
So start packing because I'm back in
Now push the pause button then start ducking
The real deal about the three
And you won't see me in the advertising
I got some words that apply to us
The real deal about the three
Here's one for the bleachers and the upper tier
Run this rap game like a brigadier
Snares on the five and thirteen
Rhymes on time and that's the given
Source of the problem is at the origin
The real deal about the three
If you pick a rose well you might just bleed
We're originators you can't feign
Ignorance or pass the blame
With the skill at will that I know you want
On a hot day with a iced latte
Devious like Wile Coyote
The real deal about the three
I didn't touch your hand man you know its all ball
You sold a few records but don't get slick
But when you really break it down you've only got two songs
Now talk about your face now don't get pissed
But I suggest you see a dermatologist
I keep that hot sauce hot not mild and weak
It's gonna burn your mouth until you wet your beak
I've got billions and billions of rhymes to flex
Your rhymes are fake like a Canal Street watch
So put your sewer boots on before your ass gets lit
Kings County is my stomping ground
So don't ask me to wine and dine ya
I'm from Brooklyn you're from Regina
With those lies you're telling you look like Toucan Sam
But my style's impregnable like the Hoover Dam
Yo what the schnitzel we're back
I don't care what you heard or care what you seen
I swear it wasn't me in Bear magazine
I go with the flow though the tempo varies
So twist the cap and pop the cork
I'll steal your keys and then I'll check your mail
And I'm the shot caller when it comes to shot calls
And block party to party the neighborhoods on lock
I'm a rhyme style writer you're a rhyme style thief
I may be paranoid you tried to fade me
Make you bug out like you don't know what to do
When you're dancing with your crew
So get that poor chicken up off your fork
My name's Mike D made in New York
Yo what the falafel you gotta get up awful
And that's word to Aunt Shirley and you could
Listen up biters go please stop
Believe what you heard when you talk
What the phone booth word to hair moose
You're on the corner and you're selling a hog's tooth
Don't mean to dis but I've got to point out
The hog's tooth belong inside the hog's mouth
I'll have dog pemmican with my tea
Times are off the hinges leave your two way at the door
We're all up the creek a long way from shore
Not walking around looking to get you cake
The D is for Diamonds not for Drakes
The name's Mike D made in New York
Back on the scene for y'all people's delight
You want peace for the people then ya say alright
We got to take the power from he
Like a snow day for school with hot cocoa
Look what the cat dragged in
So take a rest and mind your own biz
Don't underrate how I operate
So pay attention now as I begin to recap
The time and place for the mind is here and now
Keep the mind present less to worry about
But like the hammer to the nail hit the nail on the head
Well I don't shoot blanks and I don't shoot lead
Well I'm a freaky streaker like Winnie the Pooh
Like George Whipple on New York One
Got a hairy ass and that's no fun
I'm in the rhyme zone a different time zone
And on the microphone you know that I'm at home
It's time we looked past all our differences
Ideas spark my hand grabs a pen
Sweeten up the sound let me get the right blend
Nice up the sound for the A to D
Bagel from Bob and a TV Dinner
I'm the one that one that dance contest
All you gotta do is do your thing you see
And I gotta spread love in society
We gotta keep the party going on
We gotta keep the party going on
And if you want what's going down
You might just get that silky sound
I've got the fonts you want to read
All the same I've got the team
When you coming out with the new CD
We gotta keep the party going on
We gotta keep the party going on
Don't mess with crack or the baking soda
Whether in the high rise where you live like Rhoda
Or in the shack and you live like Yoda
Once again it's on like a brand new morn
If it don't hurt nobody else than
Don't be afraid to be yourself and
Special dedication and so on
We gotta keep the party going on
We gotta keep the party going on
I represent that's stupid that's for sure
All this cheese is gonna make me cry
Don't even get me started on this microphone
On a track so slick it'll make you feel all queasy
On the court I go by the name Praying Mantis
Got the edge and I've got the advantage
If you could see things from my vantage
Point then you could better understand this
I'm in the lab all day I scrabble all night
When it comes to panache I can't be beat
I got the most style from below 14th street
I can't keep a catalog up on the shelf
I splash on beats like sauce on spaghetti
Posing like you're rolling with that camp
In layman's terms let me break it down
You're flipping and flopping just like a flounder
I'm a hip hop scholar while you're left back
I'm a simple man like Chauncey Gardner
Got rhymes for jerks that's bringing on drama
Goodness gracious golly gee
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
We come together on the subway cars
We're doing fine on the One and Nine line
On the number Ten bus we fight and fuss
I remember when the Deuce was all porno flicks
Running home after school to play PIX
And hit the Fulton Street Mall for the sneakers on my feet
I know a lot's happen and you've been through hell
Through your gates at Ellis Island we passed in droves
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
You didn't rob me in the park at Dianna Ross
But everybody started looting when the light went off
From the South South Bronx on out to Queens Bridge
From Hollis Queens right down to Bay Ridge
From Castle Hill to the Lower East Side
From 1010 WINS to Live At Five
Dear New York this is a love letter
To you and how you brought us together
We can't say enough about all you do
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
Shout out the South Bronx where my mom hails from
Right next to High Bridge across from Harlem
To the Grand Concourse where my mom and dad met
Before they moved on down to the Upper West
I see you're still strong after all that's gone on
Life long we dedicate this song
Just a little something to show some respect
To the city that blends and mends and tests
Ain't nothing gonna take that away from us
Two towers down but you're still in the game
Home to many rejecting know one
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
There's a party going on in here for real
The only air time you get is on Bloopers
So renovate or evacuate
You better think twice before you start flossing
I been in your bathroom often
My to do list today is turn the party out
Getting hot in here no room to breathe
I got my pen in my hand so you best not sleep
No I'm not Herman Munster nor Dr. Spock
So here's a match my ass and your face
Listen when I tell you dog
I'm in your crawlspace
You're in front of my house and you know that's whack
Bite my rhymes with a scanner from Radio Shack
You suckers try to front like you've got the force
But I'll slay you like Vader sip you for a first course
Don't even get me started on the intercourse...
Don't step into my zone or even periphery
Can't grab a hold of my style it's too slippery
The way you act a fool son you can't erase
And you're running on your way like a steeple chase
You tried to take my title put it back in place
But now you're busted wearing panties and lace
Stealing my style from my trophy case
You're sneaking and peeking and trying to give chase
I'm in your crawl space
Calibrate your sonar when I'm in your realm
Omnipresent and omnipotent
My rhymes are whales and yours are rodents
This means huge compared to very small
They're like anvils lined up on a roof
Waiting to drop on your corny melon
First you want to battle then you start to whine
So run home where you feel safe
A phenomenon pandemonium
The club is blowing up like plutonium
What's all the fanfare what's the to do
We're known to bring the hullabaloo
On stage or at the spa
Guaranteed we bring the brouhaha
I talk more shit then drown the clown
With my leg behind my head and a rhyme to say
Ten nine eight seven six five four
Don't carry a knife and I don't carry a gun
Yo we be making mountains out of Cool Whip
Pass me the mint for the julep
Tell me everybody where is the love
Communicator check one two one two
Set the bullshit to warp factor one
At Jean Vie with a pastry
You can dance if you want to leave your friends behind
But if they don't dance and then they won't dance
Let me tell you what you can do
Step outside the cone of silence
Too much hatred and violence
We need a military decline
Got the power of the mind focused
Government like a locust
Time to act on what we be knowing y'all
Eyes on the prize and never wane
Take the bull by the reins
Same way I rock this microphone
Take the power back and let them react
Think about how we approach this
Due time we change a little something
Hey yo don't you know
To the crooked people and the crooked cops
Got to spread love before the world goes...
We need an international ban on
We need a multilateral disarm
I burn the competition like a flamethrower
My rhymes age like wine as I get older
I got the feeling and assume the lane and
We gonna party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
Make some noise if you're with me
Get paid every year like tax collection
I'm like an ornithologist when I get pissed
My ego is off and running and gone
We gonna party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
Make some noise if you're with me
Make some noise if you're with me
Make some noise if you're with me
I'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching
Put it in formaldehyde and put it in the shelf
Don't quote me now because I'm doing the lambada
Parlay romancing into the financing
We gonna party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
You gotta make some noise if you're with me
You gotta make some noise if you're with me
All day is how we play in the neighborhood
I swing my words on the track cause the track sound tight
Well hello everybody and how you been
The Emcee Whisperer kinda like a trainer
Like macaroni cause the shit sound cheesy
Of my fly styles that complete the turnstile
I flow like the water out your toilet bowls
There's a certain special talent that I never lack
Now this is the way we run it down
This is the way we get it on
See I mix my style up like a cement mixer
Don't make me sound cheap like a box of douche powder
Sit down to write and the pen blazed fire
Come through to rock such a rate to tape
Braincells get with it make you hear where we're from
We gonna rock the house until the break of dawn
We gonna rock the house until the break of dawn
We gonna rock the house until the break of dawn
You talk and talk and you just can't stop
What you say is lackluster
I thrash emcees who try to bring a filibuster
Now let's start over with a nice clean slate
My name's Mike D from New York City
I guess it's all in the mind
Go to these schools like a nice mad professor
Then I show chagrin every word that you utter
Yes you said you are a big deal
Got to control my mind
Now I don't give a fuck who the hell you are
I never asked you for part of your day
You lie like a plainclothes cop
Take a number take a look and take stock
Get the rhythm when I do the wop
At least tell me what it is I did
Or just say what should I say
Too many rappers and there's still not enough emcees
On and on until the crack of dawn
Until the year 3000 and beyond
How many rappers must get dissed
Gimme eight bars and watch me bless this
The real hip hop with which I persist
Too many rappers and there's still not enough emcees
To blow you bullshit rappers straight out the frame
My lyrics spin round like a hurricane twister
Too many rappers to shake a stick at
To all you crab rappers and hackers
I hear Russian blonde's the wettest
We come together like peanut butter and sandwiches
While you climb the corporate ladder
To make your pockets fatter
We be flipping styles like pancake batter
But I'm running like a rhino on a drinking spree
Gotta let it loose inside the toll booth
No complication want the combination to the lock
You wanna get inside well then you best knock knock
Don't keep it inside you've got to
People lining up for their own demise
To help the man make weapons to monetize
Corporate violence we can't abide
You can keep your bottle service and your cabana
But your ass drunk like you slipped on a banana
Mind to the rhyme paper to the pen
Stop before it comes true
Don't keep it inside you've got to
Another official selection from the Bill Harper collection
It's hot here gotta say it's so
I got you right where I want
Got an honest face so you turn your back
When in doubt run up your attack
At one time you were slick and your grill was cold
And now funny how the shit gets old
Now you wanna get back when you had your shine
But you run the same thing every time when you rhyme
Can't stop won't stop no compromise
It's a house of cards built out of lies
Coming down like a bird floating on the mist
Turn on the track back track and twist
You work hard to climb the list
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift
You're caught now by the skin you're in
In a bind now your thoughts go to all your sins
Hits much harder back better count on that
I tell you what we know always holds us back
Now you mutter and you stutter and you putter don't stop
I got in your heart and I shook you up
In a bind now you're caught by the fear setting in
Choked on the thought that you don't it again
Keep the competition in check
You draft your plans at your drafting desk
You try to play to win but now you lost
Like clams with no tartar sauce
Don't play no game that I can't win
Jump out the window onto a parade balloon
You're stealing my book like I was Grandmaster Caz
Got rhymes about antihistamines and analgesics
Burn like fire when I step on the scene
I've got shark's teeth so I can bite your head
I've got tiger's claws that'll scratch you dead
I've got wings like a dragon when I'm flying above
Shoot venom from my eyes when it's time to get rough
So step back and check yourself
I make you sick like at Kenny Rogers Roaster
See this rap thing is all about the braggadocio
Got so much heat that I fog your mom's glasses
Proof is in the pudding and the pudding's in my pants
The truth shall set you free
Save the date for when they hoist our number to the rafters
Like Willis Reed or Elton John
We done been in the game and our game's still on
Just holding it down like the gravitation
Running wild like rats in the Taco Bell
Making music for librarians to burly jocks
Tell him to file me under funky
Big holiday parties like Dolly Partner
My other order pad see yew is much darker
As I bust I really must encrust
This microphone rust with diamond fairy dust
Stop singing that song in the wrong key
Flashing lights to get your attention
So stop sweating me about the weather
Go shave a sheep and knit yourself a sweater
Don't get me heated or y'all in trouble
Well I was swimming in the water of the ocean
Like Dr. Jekyll with the magic potion
This routine dates way back
Yeah from the summer before last
Well my name's Mike D and I got a new name
And that new name is Larry
And my new name is Harry
And that new name is Gary
Nice in the cut and yes I'm the slicer
But don't get discombobulated and upset
Not squares on the block and not taken for a ride
And I don't never claim that sounds too grand
You gotta be the one to dance and that's a must
Yes I cuss when I grab my nuts
Got a six finger demon says excuse our dust
I'm the lyrical mathematical genius
Now take a look around this spot
Take a look around you
Take a look around you
There is a bird in here
We're giving y'all a little slice of heaven
I'll stage a coup and usurp your position
Got the mental and physical when the moment is critical
Take a look around you
Take a look around you
Lee Majors come again
Like the 16 billion dollar man
I said stop watch how I flip
At the Roller Rink down in Virginia
I see your grandpa in apple bottom jeans
Once the word gets out you can't take it back
I'm a pause tape competition expert winner
Just a doggone long armed tall yarn spinner
Take a look around you
Join the sucker emcee witness protection
Slip off my lows in the place to be
Always on time so I never botch
Don't really get in the press like Z
Don't trip and flip and then I stop to find
The odds are stacked for those who lack
Been a lucky motherfucker when it comes to that
Dr. Bombay is the ladies choice
Step on stage so we smoke and dry moist
On and on to the break of dawn
On and on to the break of dawn
On and on to the break of dawn
You can't stop you've got to keep on
You can't stop you've got to keep on
Come take a shower and wash that ass
I'm gonna feed this hunger that smile like a dinosaur
You can't stop you've got to keep on
You can't stop you've got to keep on
You can't stop you've got to keep on
listening to Dope Man
I got the golden style
You people go wild when I bless this crowd
Break dancing at your door on a pile of shit
Set the bag on fire for the fuck of it
Yo I bust into your radio station chunk a smoke bomb
Put on my gas mask and put my tape on
By the time you figure out what went wrong
Light up my jet pack and I'm gone
And twist their hands in the air and bop their heads in time
I keep the competition sealed under a hex
And if you waste my time then I get vexed
We got styles ain't none of y'all can top it
I'm on the edge and I'm on the brink
We've been getting fly with the highest above
He's still contemplating it though
B Boys in the cut and we're here to stay
A little patience with the tribulations
Rhymes are not just for breakfast any more
My broad sword will cut through your chain mail
I'm like Oscar the Grouch
Just imagine the 42nd Street C train bathroom
This is the type of shit that's gonna scratch that itch
I switch up my name pretty much how I like
This routine dates way back
A lot of people may remember this routine
I can't think of nothing to say
I can't think nothing to say
But I am a drunk that way
You think you got it all right
So I am nothing to say
Pick up the drama and pitch it all away
What happened to my dream of fame
I can't think nothing to say
And what you give is what you get
And what you give is what you get
You've got names like Billy Ray
Watching MTV and you watch on
Cut the sides and don't touch the back
Shiny chrome rims never rusted
Driving through the tunnel and you might get busted
You know you took that girl to bed
About a hair style that's way of life
They said he tried to freak it with a high school girl
Joey got horny and now he's over
Joey goes to jail for the rest of his life
Whether in a penthouse or a cave dweller
And yes I got a plan I'm a carry out it
Yes I love life and I try not to doubt it
When it rains I don't use an umbrella
That will make you think
Flowing like water that you love to drink
Creamy like buffalo mozzarella
Sneaking around you know I smell ya
Well I play ya like a peanut and throw the shell ya
Well I could give a fuzz if ya think you're a baller
Middle school rapper and the crowd gets your love
If ya think about your grandma go ahead call her
I give a little shout to Nelson Mandela
Known for the words that make you scream and holler
Butter's on the table now watch it soften
Bring in those beats and I'm a bring them muffin
Like a mind gone mad that is unwinding
In a padded room the walls you're climbing
Don't sign on the line if it looks binding
Ya have to get loose and find the lining
Face down don't turn around
Listen to the bass pound
From all type of angles
This ain't no star spangled banner
Rock from New York to Savannah
Some run some come plenty have fun
You're fucking right that I might say...
So listen up and don't move just play the groove
Don't dime when I crime cause kid that's
That's because you're new but
Don't mean to boast I don't mean to brag but I got the grab bag
Of funky shit you wish you had
Hands high reach for the sky
Just like a blink of an eye when the shots rang
Pass the zags with the Billboard Mag
But freeze feel the breeze if ya sneeze than you're shot
I've got the mind maligned
Got to turn it around
A diamond in the rough
I've got to fix my mind
Because the mind's maligned
I've got to turn it around
Because this self centered thing is keeping me off track
Went and called Freckles
Got ran under the covers
I've got the mind maligned
Got to turn it around
We're so damn hard we never sweat
In the heart in the mind it'll make you blind
It'll make the other rappers a drop a dime
Do you mind huh... It can take you home
And teach you how to fess on the microphone
And all the fine women Italian fell in love with me
I say come on Mike D. lets flash some dough
On the go all of the time
And now he's the one who's gonna show you how to dance
He'll bust the know how to do it to you
Just four fresh folks and we form a fresh crew
You know the whole world is on my jock
And I will do it to you Eddie know it's you I please
Got a big tool of reproduction
Just take a number and get in line
And now something new a double time cool rhyme
Suck on this this beat rocks tiny
You know that I can surely be the number one in frequency
For everyone that's on my jock
You know that I can surely rock
I like to talk I take the time
Turn it in I turn it out
I know how to turn you on just like a light
I'm number one and I'm the one
So bet the fly rhymes to make you move
Everybody in the world who ever you are
Well I'll put it to you I'm Mike D
When I'm on the go I put the ball in the hoop
I'll take you for a sucker and I'll throw you to the ground
Take that if you think you can
Meet the floor and that to this here rap
Now you know you can bust that move
If you wanna see some more when I'm not on the floor
Just come on back stage and I'll tell you how to turn it
And I'll know that's me
With the ultimate rhymes from tip to bass
And then I'll do them all one at a time
Hearers of the tone with the sensitive poem
Transmitted with the voice like a sousaphone
We be beaming these rhymes to the satellite
I put a whole potato salad right down your back
I get mad respect at the old folk's home
You're like the Tidy Bowl man spinning down the drain
We're gonna change our name to The Disco Three
Update my firmware and I'm good to go
The human switchboard and interferons
I'm known on a roll like Caduceus
I got the sexy Dig Dug calendar
Mix Master's scratching like he's got lice
My Uncle Freddie's making horseradish
Groggy eyed and fried I'm headed for the station
Head for the last car fluorescent light blackout
Policeman told my homeboy yo put that crack out
You know you light up when the lights go down
And then you read the New York Post Fulton St. downtown
Same faces every day but you don't know their names
Trench coat wing tip going to work
And you be pulling a train like Captain Kirk
Pick pocket gangsters paying their debts
Overworked and underpaid staring at the floor
Prostitutes spandex caught in the slide doors
Now you're stuck between the stations and it seems like an eternity
Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity
A fine for disturbing the peace
The neck tortoise the Lees I creased
Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm
Bust into the conductor's booth and busted out rhymes
Over the loud speaker about the hard times
Riding the train down from the El Barrio
Went from the station to Orange Julius
All the ladies in the house
Hey ladies in the place
Girls girls girls girls
She thinks shes the passionate one
Hey hey hey hey ladies
Like Frankenstein or Count Dracula
I never settle for less and that's a fact
Bound to make money off the shit that I'm growing
Like that y'all and you don't quit
Keep it on y'all rock the sure shit
I put the pen to the paper and I went off
I'm dropping knowledge and wisdom like a mad head dog
Lyrics on the brain and they sit fermenting
I try to go and learn the give and the go
Free up my mind let loose with the lyric flow
Trying to stay positive and feeling all right
It's like that y'all and ya don't quit
So pass the pen and then pass the pad
The sex rhyme kid is back in the panic
Gonna drop the ball on my damn mechanic
Gotta get back and count my blessings
This ride is in motion and I can't get let off
Realized I was trying to get my brain notated
Mr. Mix has got the groove
Abs One has got the groove
Chuck D has got the groove
Yo man Mark K what's up with that
We seen you with them long dollars and you know that
And now what do you do
I don't even wanna hear about it
I give up I can't make a record with you guys
You guys are a bunch of funky funky idiots
You don't know how to produce a record no how
Yeah we don't even need you here in the studio
We can do it better ourselves
Where's the funky bass at
That's not too wild for me
You're gonna fuck up a place for new birth
You're cutting the last of the forests on the planet
Only a few hundred years since Columbus landed
Well it's due time that we look and pay attention
As the windows who knows show the knowledge with us
In these great times we still neglect
And there's more people in the pen everyday
So I visualize resolution
We come a long way with the peace in the East
As it gets got hear a changing in same
And this is the Millennium still felt today
I hear the same stories time after time
Who shall loose by kindness and it's plain to see
Now we don't have to stand for this oppression any longer
We must interconnect it as though we sure have won
If we want to avoid planetary destruction
So I work and I work because the hate in my mind
Has assumed the truth and I know I'll find
And I visualize resolution
See it all as a state of constant evolution
The world leaders were terrified of losing their pride
Vanishing numbers of unimaginable destruction
Sure as we boast they're at their last production
Threatening and challenging nature against nation
Sprouting threats is insecure
Guns are for the fighting and they're immature
Thinking that we're better than our fellow human beings
So I wanna empower the limit I can
And pass it along so we can do pass the pan
Some times I sit and I watch my mind
And stop and visualize resolution
For everyday is in a state of evolution
There's nothing wrong with your TV set
We couldn't be harder
Our beats are bigger and better and longer
You'll walk the plank for your dis
Like claps of thunder from the cumulus clouds
So we'll pump up the beat and make it real loud
Heavy metal tension running through your blood
You'll crush out hard rock hard beats
Some people say this has been done
Fists of fury in an MC bout
Rock so hard it'll knock you out
The very first blow is a kick in the snout
The final blow is the five finger jam
Sometimes I write rhythms rather write rhymes
He writes his and I write mine
Not before long I can hear you say
In a way these boys got juice
When the party gets loose
Like you know it should
Always so quick with the rhymes
Girl you know it's true
You know you know it's true
Mike D. is in love with you
Girl you know it's true
Mike D. is in love with you
Everybody knows that I broke your heart you know
Everybody knows Mike D. broke your heart
You know just ain't fair
That the cars were built to my favor you know
Girl you know it's true
Mike D. is in love with you
And then Ricky Powell came over
Girl you know it's true
Mike D. is in love with you
Girl you know it's true
Mike D. is in love with you
Oh it's true it's true it's true baby...
Girl you know it's true
Mike D. is in love with you
Girl you know it's true
It's so true now baby...
Mike D. is in love with you
Girl you know it's true
Women taken over the money
If you can get a roof over your head
I'd like to welcome everybody to the
Girl you know it's true
Mike D. is in love with you
Girl you know it's true
Your mother came over
Mike D. is in love with you
Girl you know it's true
Years and years you try to keep her a secret
Said she's your cousin that came for a visit
You said it was the maid that hung up the phone
Don't start to think about the worlds discuss
This week we all will meet
Right now the party season will reach its peek
Trick number one is to grab her buns
Take the pockets off so we can grip it right
She better be ready to play the wall
Now that you've heard thoughts quite absurd
At last a neurotic feast
We're slaying your sister like a horny beast
As you can see most definitely
But your sisters so def we might scheme on your mother
We can't ignore now that we saw
Because your sister's def
Took a walk around the crack of dawn
I noticed her bedroom light was on
Her shadow moved over as the lights went lower
I crept to the window to see a little closer
Later on I came around the way
There had to be a reason for the news I learned
She took me downstairs and we crashed the bar
After a while my head between pink nipples
You can bet if she gets wet
I got a lot of raps but I'll be real
I never need a horse I like to chill
My Tribe went down in the hall of fame
I'm better known as the Master G
When they're stung by the rapping ranger
Had a little talk with my medicine man
When you're stung by the rapping ranger
All you suckers better step aside
And you can put me to the test at your request
I rock you out of your moccasin
He kicked off his shoes and did the Monster Mash
The shit with this bitch
Yo I said I'm calling you B.
Maybe I should scratch
Well I am Country Mike and I'd like to say hello
Catfish and corn bread is what I love to eat
Right now I'm gonna introduce my man Slim on the fiddle
I'm going down in history as the baddest cowboy there ever could be
Just throw your hands up in the air
Well I'm chilly chill most of the time
But I make a lot of noise when I bust a fresh rhyme
Met a young girl and got cold busy
Stand at the bar don't sit on a stool
Ride a Harley not a goddamn mule
There's one more thing that you should know
Mike D... is a desperado
He punched Big Bird in his goddamn beak
I peeped out the back with the fresh unique
It must be a drag just getting old
I'm on top and that's the way to be
You know I'm goddamn stupid
Farther than any other record can go
I got the def rhymes and it ain't no riddle
I'm the king of the castle with no hassle
Got more rhymes than my boy Abe Lincoln
Get those suckers cause you know I gotta
Can't eat Chinese cause it makes me burp
Went from bar to bar I got rejected
One more thing that you should know
Yeah this is dedicated to all you backstabbing fools out there
There's gonna be hell to pay I catch up with you
I'm not the type to turn a blind eye
When you're asleep I'm gonna catch you guy
Jump on my back I'm gonna whip your behind
Got eyes in the back of my head and ears for miles
You tried to knock a train off the track
You shaved my head and then stabbed me in the back
Four days in a row and my tires is flat
I'm gonna hitch him on my pickup truck and make him pay his dues
I'm not the type to turn a blind eye
When you're asleep I'm gonna catch you guy
I'm not the type to turn a blind eye
When you're asleep I'm gonna catch you guy
I'm not the type to turn a blind eye
When you're asleep I'm gonna catch you guy
My girl likes franks not pork and beans
I'm gonna wax that girl right out them jeans
Because you know I'm down
Find a def girl and do the new dance
Because you know I'm down
Took me to the bathroom and ran her lip
Because you know I'm down
In a world gone mad it's hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
It's not the politicians but their actions I despise
You and Saddam should kick it like back in the day
But you build more bombs as you get more bold
All you want to do is take control
Now put that axis of evil bullshit on hold
Citizen rule number 2080
Politicians are shady
I don't doubt it look at how they act
In a world gone mad it's hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
We're reaching a point where we can't turn back
Let's lose the guns and let's lose the bombs
And stop the corporate contributions that they're built upon
Peace to the Middle East peace to Islam
In a world gone mad it's hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
Lose the weapons of mass destruction and the hate
Well I'm not pro Bush and I'm not pro Saddam
We need these fools to remain calm
Trying to play tough for the camera
Get your hand out my grandma's pocket
We need health care more than going to war
In a world gone mad it's hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
Yeah everybody knows that Mike D broke your heart
The better side of the bargain
Girl you know it's true
Girl you know it's true
I'm real sorry you had to walk in like that and see ...
I'm going to audition and I do not
They do not turn me down
I'm driving to the hill with auntie pat
And uncle bill and I hope I will get a
Where I will get one chance to shine
It happened after World War II
St. Louis beat the English in an
Unexpected shock and so they went
On to play Brazil but they lost
I waited for some three hours and
Then I heard my name so I rushed
They asked me a few questions like
Them everything that was true
I told them I liked ribbons and pink's my
Favorite color and all they had to say was
So I waited patiently for five days
And then I got a little mad but I
Did not care that much
A few days later the phone rang
So I went on and filmed the movie
Took her to the place threw the mattress in her face
I took her to the place
Threw the mattress in her face
I kick out the jams and tell you who I am
Up the crack of dawn I'm on my way
We're talking two foot dump and there'll be no delay
I've got hole in my mouth where my teeth should be
I heard the captain's gonna sign him to jive and that's the truth
Produce organic from my own yard
Looking at my board and my old boots
Seeing a waist deep champagne moment of truth
I give a shout out so where you at
Horatio park right now and I'm a shake ya
I need some inspiration so get the best out
Good vibes flowing all around
Not a worry in mind as the friends around
Well the bird is the word and you're as light as a feather
And I'm waking old ladies out their underwear
I might be a white boy but I'm no goofy
Down with bubble gum and ninth creation
Get down we've got the sound sensation
This US Nation needs show restraint
This Government Needs a Tune Up
This Government Needs a Tune Up
This Government Needs a Tune Up
This Government Needs a Tune Up
Public help without the religious founding
Now I'm not trying to say I hate the USA
I'd live somewhere else if I felt that way
This president is acting mad shifty
FBI and the cops keep all filing
Who protest the war and who their dialing
This Government Needs a Tune Up
This Government Needs a Tune Up
This Government Needs a Tune Up
This Government Needs a Tune Up
This Government Needs a Tune Up
This Government Needs a Tune Up
Need a little democratic socialism
Ease up on the campaign finance schism
You're not a real member of society
Our government's being run by big business
Come on somebody and get with this
This Government Needs a Tune Up
This Government Needs a Tune Up
This Government Needs a Tune Up
This Government Needs a Tune Up
Bitch Bitch Bitch Bitch
From Hamburg way down to south
I saw that a strange hunting music
It's been coming in on a interstellar frequency
But it regular intervals
It's like a message or some kind
You never seen this stroke of genius
I want L. O. V. E. love you
I want K. I. S. S. kiss you
never ever think of jerkin me
Damn right it's a disastrous sight
Why you think I've been in prison more than half of my life
Y'all can chill as long as my cheddar is straight
Who never bothered to teach you cause the bitch was that shady
With a satellite phone you couldn't call my bluff
Your big fucking mouth just had a violent start
More kids know my name than Mike Jackson's private parts
Better be ready when the sun turns black
Better be ready when the moon turns red
Better be ready when the Son comes back
Better be ready when He wakes the dead
Better be ready when the stars fall down
Better be ready when the stars fall down
Better be ready when the stars fall down
Better be ready when they hit the ground
Striking the earth with the rod of His mouth
With a hand to the north and a foot to the south
With His winnowing fork cut the wheat from the chaff
With His winnowing fork cut the good from the crap
Smashing up the tables and breaking down chains
Lighting up the mountains and beating down the wave
Tearing up the curtain in the holy place
Lifting up the veil from her beautiful face
Better be ready when the sun turns black
Better be ready when the moon turns red
Better be ready when the Son comes back
Better be ready when He wakes the dead
Hauling the world through the holes in His hands
With the stripes on His back he'll be healing the lands
Calling to you all and He's making a stand
Drawing a 1000 mile line in the sand
Writing down the law in the flesh of your heart
Calling when you wander to the left or the right
Beginning to the end and the end from the start
The logos in the chaos and the light in the dark
Better be ready when the sun turns black
Better be ready when the moon turns red
Better be ready when the Son comes back
Better be ready when He wakes the dead
Better be ready when the stars fall down
Better be ready when the stars fall down
Better be ready when the stars fall down
Behold the rider on the horizon
Riding His horse through 1000 miles of devastation
A pillar of smoke all around Him
He rides through 1000 years of desolation
Making a trail of blood
All the way from His cloak
In a dead straight highway to the skyline
Doesn't blink once as He follows His beloved
And 1000 angels fill up the skies and cry
His eyes are burning with wrath so I ask
He shows me the scars on His hands
But His arm are strong
And I can't believe that He could be beat
My jacket is dirty and He hands me His clean clothes
And in the blinking of an eye He was gone into the night
So I sat there and cursed my hesitation
I've walked every inch of this town
And the people of this city all sound like a broken record
Like propaganda slogans looping over on the television
The watchmen on the walls are looking down on me
Staring like they want me
Or like they're going to come and beat my face in
Time and space are suspended
The world turns red and I'm kissing the pavement
Wake up three days later
And I'm right behind You in Your trail of blood
I messed up his clothes pretty bad
The desert is a blanket of fire
Heat crushes my face into frown lines
Very deep and very heavy
Sweat disappears into space instantly
Leaves the face covered in salt
Itchy like sack cloth and ashes and a hard days work
And the whole time I can't understand
How my shoes have got no holes in them
And my shirt id still on my back
Because food falls right out of the sky whenever you need it
Because water gushes from the rocks as though they were bleeding
And peeling like a banana
Developing wrinkles and growing in character
Following a man through the sand
He keeps my shoes on my feet and my shirt on my back
I was in the wilderness
That son of a gun must have chased me 1000 miles
He wanted my blood on his horn
I could see it in his eyes
Didn't ever get tired
Chased me all the way without stopping
Somethings got to give
I guess you can't run forever
All of my life running from animals
No point dragging it out into the never
So I decide to stop running
My God is able to save me from the power of the rhino
I'd rather not be a Godless chicken on the run from death
Stand my ground and have faith
I think I'd rather stand my ground and have faith
And looked him in his big red eyes
Either side of that horn
Which is twice the size of an ice cream cone
Didn't do him any good though
A piece of rope appeared like a noose around his throat
Snapped his his neck backwards so it broke
The horn smashed into 1000 pieces
I followed the piece of rope back into the hands of Jesus
Pillar of fire in the night
Pillar of cloud in the night
Double edged sword in the fight
Animals rage in the streets
Never laid a finger on me
Killer of each of the dead
Count every hair on my head
Love like the apple of His eye
All the cats are screaming at the dogs
And the dogs aren't even listening
And the rush hour traffic doesn't care
About the road kill scattered everywhere
And in the middle of all my filthy lies
Everybody knows we'll see this kingdom fall
Wasting time inside the dragon's mind
We'll see this kingdom fall apart
Everybody knows we'll see this kingdom fall apart
Before your time is done
Burn your hopes and burn your wage slips
Everybody knows we'll see this kingdom fall apart
She has become to me like a lion in the forest
I can remember when it was just the two of us
Then a third came along and placed himself between us
Decisions were made behind lame excuses
They ran off and screwed each other on the high places
Hoping that My face wouldn't see them
But they didn't even know their right from their left hand
So I sat by Myself on the Mount of Olives
Where Jesus cried for His lost beloved
Because I knew where that devil would take her in the end
Sometimes she'd cross the street and pretend she didn't see me
Sometimes she'd walk right by and just be smiling slightly
And always she looked down right through her shoes
Sometimes her eyes were vacant and other times angry
Sometimes mascara ran from her head to her feet
Sometimes she would be screaming at her children
Other times she would just ignore them completely
And he didn't say anything
Looking for the action
I shut my eyes and screamed like a lion in the city
And all of the windows in his apartment shattered
And showered them naked in bed
As they lay in twisted sensations
And alienation from each other
The smell of their bed
The taste of each other's spit
And the crying of unwanted babies in distress
Laying in our bed surrounded by glass and plaster
The ashes of our own demise
1000 adulterers cut their losses
Curse each other and wander off into the night
We are 1001 vagabonds
Refugees running from the chaos of our own lives
From the four corners of the earth we are asking the skies
We cursed your name all day and all night
Till we gained the world and we lost the light
And a 1000 1000 armies died
We shook our heads and looked to the skies
You said something and we turned to the side
Then we saw you but we shut our eyes
Paid our daughters to dance for us
Raced our sons to the ends of innocence
Took it all for ourselves somehow
We didn't give a damn who we hammered down
In between us and everything else
From everlasting to everlasting to everlasting to everlasting
The shadows are long and the day is passing
Hearts on fire like a burning building
Blasphemous names written all over it
Too afraid for sleeping
Spend our days blaspheming
Rolling around and screaming
Bed too short and sheets too thin
Snow is falling and the ship is sinking
Crucified You all over again
We got no legs to stand on
His love endures forever
Walking out east of Eden with a mark upon my head
If anybody tries to kill me
Damn sure they'll be dead
And I don't know why the LORD will avenge my life
But I'm ready to climb the mountain and die
The blood of slaves runs through these veins
A crown on both my heads
And I'm crying because I feel I've been a traitor to my own
So I'm ready to take my crown off and fight
Running from my masters house for killing an evil man
I got bad dreams I can't believe he's never going to breathe again
So I'm going to become a shepherd and start again
Looking out for the wife and kids and chasing after sheep
Jesus calls out from the bush and says
Crushed like a thousand million coke cans into the pavement
So I'll tell that city to set my people free
Standing in front of the president and all his politicians
Folks have been writing letters to these for years and years about all kinds of issues
You'd better let my people go this time
I'm here because the LORD is by my side
Watch these rivers turn to red
The sun blocked right out
Watch all of your firstborn die
And the military buried alive in the Red Sea
And I'm ready to take my people and leave
Bury me LORD because I'm tired out
Everybody's hanging off me
Breaking up fights all day and all night
Choices coming up faster than I can choose which way is right
It's always something
I don't know why I keep on trying to try
And I'm ready to climb the mountain and die
Sitting around thinking way more thoughts than a man can think
Seen so many people I begin to wonder if they all exist
And my heads so full of everything
I feel like a walking television
And I'm ready to pull the plug out and sigh
Ran the race pretty dang hard
Lost myself a million times
Grit my teeth and smashed the rock
I don't care about anything now
I've got nothing to lose anymore
I've got nobody in heaven by You
And the world has nothing I want
I count it all a loss to be found by Your side
And I'm ready to climb the mountain and die
Bury me LORD because I'm tired out
Weeping in the garden with blood on His face
Then He crushed the snake
The sun turned dark at noon and th moon turned red
And the campfires burned
A third of the stars fell down to the earth
I saw the city and I wept for her
As I watched her give birth to her own misery
And the whole world is made of concrete and steel
And the sun only sets on the days when it rises
For as long as I've been alive no one's ever looked into my eyes
For fear of seeing the truth about me in my irises
I think you and I both know we've been had
So we look from side to side trying to find out who the liar is
But we'll never look into each other's eyes
For fear of seeing the image of God and falling in love with it
And the whole world is made of beauty and corruption
The wonder of perfection is for now lost on all of us
He has the will to do what nobody else does
The trees grow tall and we all reach for the skies
No one ever looks anyone in the eyes
For fear of really knowing each other
For fear of what that might cost us
I'll clean yours with my tears
And all the liars and the cheats will be washed away
I'll clean yours with my tears
And all the liars and the cheats will be washed away
An eye for an eye and a life for a life
I'd go under the knife to see you waking up alive again
Your lips have gone blue and your blood is all spent baby
Your hearts gone as black as the devil inside your chest
I'd slit my wrists and give blood through a drip into your veins
O please baby just open your eyes again
O please heart beat again
O please lungs breathe again
O please voice say my name
O please heart beat again
O please lungs breathe again
O please darling speak to me
I'll clean yours with my tears
And all the liars and the cheats will be washed away
I'll clean yours with my tears
And all the liars and the cheats will be washed away
And we will cry at Your feet
Rap murder fashion on parking lot cypher
Dare one of y'all come test this
I thought this shit was this and that
I kill you with a rhyme I wrote with no arms
Crack the Gray Goose and roll the Dutches
I burn through studio booths and fiber glass
Slap a chick on the ass and make her pay for the tab
Y'all junior varsity players can't get off the bench
We've been together two years from July
Your love is like a breath of fresh air
I don't care about that
Your loves on my mind
And you've got me open
From the thought of you
We'll always be together
No one could dare compare
When they see us they stop and stare
They see the joy we share
That I'll never let you go
Your love's on my mind
It's funny how you stop time
And you've got me open
From the thought of you
We'll always be together
We'll always be together
Now what could that mean
We'll always be together
We'll always be together
Won't catch me off guard on no boulevard
I'm riding solo don't need no one but me
I do not sniff or roll it
It do not drip when I pour it
All y'all look like you still fly Spirit
I don't know what made all y'all haters
It do not drip when I pour it
Grown as hell and you still hating
I don't need no receipts
They keep going up like a money tree
Shop in these deals like a money spree
Hop out the Porsche with a baddie
Do what I say like I'm daddy
Please don't leave me baby
please come back here
You're my girl and that's my world
You're my girl and that's my world
My girl my girl my girl
My girl my girl my girl

It says you are the one
I couldn't help myself but put it in words
And now that you've come to me I don't have to run
Now it's all about just me and my boo
That's how much love I have for you girl I'm so sprung
Thankful for your love
You are the sunshine in my life girl
The way you say my name I know you feel the same girl you are my one
That's why you're my baby
And this is what I have to say...
I love you down in every way
It doesn't matter baby everyday
It's all about the way you feel baby
And we can take it down south baby
You know I do it all for you you're my boo that's true wanna let the world know you're my baby
I don't wanna be without your love
YOU ARE THE ONE IN MY LIFE
Me and my crew can only bust with the real shit
In my heart all I got is pain
Could it be that I play the game
To loose you I can't maintain
Realize in the light while love shines bright
Days passed without you can't forget you
Letting me be the cloud hanging above me
Raining on me missing your touch
Nights get longer and it's hard to clutch
We are apart brakes my heart
In time my love unfurls
Till then wait for you girl
Let me show you if that's okay
You just can't control
You just can't control
My friend talked about you
Maybe I still wanted you to suffer because of me
On nights when I miss you for no reason
I was too young back then
Love was hard so I tried to avoid you
It was too much pressure for me and so I was unhappy
My submission to you without reason
I hear stories from the radio that I agree with
It's exactly how I feel right now
I wonder if the story was sent by you as I fall asleep
I was too young back then
Love was hard so I tried to escape
Eventually it was too much pressure so I became unhappy
Although now it's too late
If we ever run into each other on the streets
But today you look a bit different
You look especially a bit cold
Your eyes that look at me are filled with pity
Though I had so much I wanted to ask you
You cut me off right away
Your long hair flowing
As it hit my cheek and passed away
You turn away and left right away
Nothing comes to my mind
You say that I scare you now
You know how I was in the past
Then you will know baby
A life without you is like an imprisonment for life
The people of the world have turned their backs against me
The corners of their eyes are all twisted up
Is the fact that you became the same as them
You know how I was in the past
Then you will know baby
You know how I was in the past
Then you will know baby
Now that I got plenty hope
Move it to the kitchen take my hand
Gotta let the whole world know
I'm still alive I'm still alive I'm still alive
Put on my jacket and than...
We're the hottest in the world like d d d d d this yo
Let's party baby shake it baby all night long just one night one shot
We're the hottest in the world like d d d d d this yo
Don't wanna take a fall
It's best to break it up
Uh huh we break it break it
Or thought we make it make it
And now we cover it up
Sad it just ain't happening
Wish it could be better
But I just can't let ya
Shouldn't be less than happy
I couldn't live with myself seeing you lacking
The things you deserve
Must believe that it hurts
I feel the aching through my body
It just takes a bigger part of me
I wish that weren't so...
Big bang big bang we're back again one more time say
Big bang big bang don't stop let's play
Tonight tonight tonight tonight
But you know that I love you girl girl girl
Tonight tonight tonight tonight
Tonight tonight tonight tonight
You know when you lost a love
Don't know what to think or do
Tell me what is right and what is wrong
Tell me what is right and what is wrong
What is right and what is wrong what is right and what is wrong
Tell me what is right and what is wrong
What is right and what is wrong what is right and what is wrong
Tell me what is right and what is wrong
What is right and what is wrong what is right and what is wrong
She stands there looking at me
I know she's wondering
If she should kick it with me
Cause you know I got that something
If she be wanting to freak
That shaking thundering
And now she's starting to creep
Her scent takes me high
I wanna rock with you
Do everything with you
Run around in the rain with you
Everyday now only you
Do everything with you
Run around in the rain with you
Everyday now only you
It's getting tough in the scene
The place is jumping man
I grab her hand and proceed
Through the crowd just tumbling
I really want her with me
What she keeps doing to me
Her scent takes me high
I wanna rock with you
Do everything with you
Run around in the rain with you
Everyday now only you
Do everything with you
Run around in the rain with you
Everyday now only you
I know that your thinking I won't be right
But it's you now I made up my mind
From here we can start a new wonderful life
Always and forever you
I wanna do everything with you baby that's it
Me and you baby together
So we can do all those things fantastic
Yeah yeah I gotta rock
I wanna rock with you
Do everything with you
Run around in the rain with you
Everyday now only you
Do everything with you
Run around in the rain with you
Everyday now only you
Do everything with you
Run around in the rain with you
Cause of the pressure I apply every time I bust a rhyme
Don't say it doesn't matter cause that's how they stole the last one
Bloodline of a champion with heart of the lion
Way before my time and reside in the Dirty Dirty
With my ears to the streets and my eyes to the sky
With my ears to the streets and my eyes to the sky
I do think you're fierce and that you
Killing them of course
With the features of an angel
And the bottom of a horse
Makes ya moist like the dark fudge
Brownie with the nut of your choice
You done let the juice ooze down
When alarm sound off around two is up ahead
Who gives a damn about the past
I make her drip all her liquids
Then get butt booty naked when I spit on some pimp shit
Make her legs shake so she never loses interest
With the Polaroid camera I have to take two flicks
With no steroids or other artificial juices.
When I slip into this boo while I slide into this booth
Sit yourself down on my big old bed
Don't you want to make a freaky memory with me
So later on you can think about it then you'll be like
With one stroke of the pen
Been under construction for two years
But now it's about that time I double dutch my way in
It's like the game is haunted cause there's so many ghost writers
Me see I'm a lifer with supply that may seem endless
Try to all the way now
It's not another let down
Got something to say right now...
Like the leases on these cars
With so many bosses why are they still
Help a brother get up out this pig pen
Pa int a pretty picture like I'm chilling with my friends
Every body's got a pocket full of ends to spend
Put it all together or fit in
Yes I'm is the product of the ghetto where I've lived
Soaked up game as a little bitty kid
And now I'm just big ya dig.
Try to all the way now
It's not another let down
Got something to say right now...
Why don't you come and find out what this is all about
I will only say this once so come and follow us.
See we not even gonna play with them either
We the type of people
The beginning before the beginning
Spend it how you spend it
Or spend it until it's gone
Go get you a business loans
Try to all the way now
It's not another let down
Got something to say right now...
I twist my A hat to the side just for style
They got flour for tortillas and lettuce for enchiladas
In a blink those folks could have you sleeping in the clink
A beehive cause now everybody buzzing around me
Could it be the way that the verse is sounding
Paint look like root beer when the sun was shining
Self preservation is the rule when you do aim
Cause you're all up in my system
I can feel you from my head to my toes
Get the south dick up out your mouth
See we know everything you're about
But not like the kilt above the knees
Or fertilizer for the trees
Emergency vehicle last seen speeding from the scene
Stay so fresh and oh so motherfucking clean
It's the son of Chico Dusty
Must be West Savannah bad
Had to go to church on Sundays with Great Grandma and Granddad
Taught me always follow Jesus when the grass didn't have a path
Special forces of the rap game so you best take heed of that
Don't ruin their appetite because your shit is really whack
Another story to tell
Listen to the angelic plucking of the puppet strings
And rides of into the horizon of infinite regression... victorious
All contenders to the throne are left naked
Because the truth is the only thing you could never be stripped from
That's affecting our youth today...
If we just stop lying...
If we just stop lying...
Not fake like a prosthetic leg or prostitute
I'm the type of dude that sends your baby mama out for food
They come see me so they can come be freaks
Once upon a rhyme I knew this girl and she was fine
Top flight security on these hoes man
She drop it low only for me to pick her up
Her give me open mouth sugar and she go hard for me
We burn it down like California trees in the breeze
Like beer and pretzels with the game I go good
Gathering artillery for the battle
I stole your couch and I took your truck to move it with
I bet you can't hitch that semi up to this tow truck
Yeah I'm pale but I'll impale you with an Impala
Couldn't take it so you leave
Next day and still no sign of daddy.
In love with the only example of family.
But didn't know ya fell for
But I've been waiting for this day to come.
Waiting for the day to come
Man I'm gonna get me just one
But didn't know ya fell for
But I've been waiting for this day to come.
Lady come and give me some
Just lay back girl have some fun.
Can I come over let me squeeze
You so tight girl let me see
Just what you can do for me.
Drop down low and shake it please.
Nothing in the world can keep us apart
Or like a fed with a no knock warrant.
But didn't know ya fell for
But I've been waiting for this day to come.
Lady come give me some
Just lay back girl have some fun
I come over let me squeeze
You so tight girl let me see
Just what you can do for me
Never will you fall apart
Never will you fall apart
Until you really really know
I wonder when will I know
To hell if I don't pray
Like a mannequin in the window I don't say
Foreign trips are taken
And I don't like to waste no time
You can be down or... yeah
You lived in my heart
Secret melodies haunt me at night
Maybe lies and lullabies
This is my last farewell
As I glare through the smoke tinted windows...
For those who think life is unfair
With a fistful of your girlfriend's hair
Daddy Fat Sacks back on the scene
Money shot to a Three movies
Like a lace front wig stuck to the forehead
Best believe I'll change the steeds
Slow it down just for the sport
Just to let you know that everything is straight
My recitals are vital and maybe needed for survival
Like the Bible or any other good book that you read
Can slaughter entire teams with the ink that my pen bleeds
Don't want no girlfriends
Take another huff and puff and choke and toke
Icky sticky sticky and stuff a bowl and
The rhymes I designed are truly unrefined
Like diamonds with a spec of blood dug up out a mine
Flows flood between the ears right behind my eyes
I take my time when deciding what to write
Reputation trump tight like the husband want a wife
Tuck yourself I can tell that you're terrified
Check my record you'll see that I'm verified
I don't think I need to hit y'all with another verse
There's no time to retreat and no surrender
Been ready for battle General Patton's no beginner
You snitching on yourself and no it's your front they come through
Without a tap on your phone
The only thing they had to do is listen to raps on your songs...
Fuck boys will drop their jaws and all because here something new
You need me like a junkie needs a razor blade and plate
Trying to block my shine just ain't gone happen so don't try
Inking hit up after hit
This penmanship is so legit
I came equipped like a prophylactic
Now they rich try to piss everybody to trick off
Really man you done say some silly things
And the fella Dana Dane
In the streets. Cost a stupid check roll another pack
Not when god's got his hands on me only the strong survive
But with disaster comes a great responsibility
We chose to lead not follow
It's a hard pill to swallow
We go through this everyday
Adding more to the story
Trying to make it interesting
Lying to yourself like it really happened
I think we'll have to save the day
But not like Captain Save
Oh way deep in outer space where the freaks are not afraid
To crank that bitch in the moonlight while nobody's getting paid
Foundation sturdy as ankle weights or shoe of cement
But the enemy is winning because your punk ass be afraid
But I spray what's on my mind to educate and entertain
For Reality TV would seem to be that big mistake
And now Big Brother's got these cameras deep in each and every state
While each rapper claims to be the heavyweight
To back up my back up plan
Motherfucker let's go
To back up my back up plan
This is how it starts
Momma fell heel over head and says you was the one
I be damned if we posing for pictures and throwing rice
Maybe throwing up in Vegas while Daddy's on the dice
Act right and you can get my second string spotlight
This'll be the last official offer before dismissal
Girl I hardly know you
Girl I hardly know you
Cause you and your mouth really do wonders
I see all the signs when you showed the full moon from behind
A toast I propose to all those
This is just the genesis
I been a member since
I turned the age of innocence and if you behave then
Slide inside you baby
Flossing on the same track I hear Big and Gucci on
Now we remixed it like it's two different packs
I still get if off with the soft and the hard
Now it's stacks that I stack for the sixteen bars
Used to dodge them laws in them stolen cars
Like the backside of a skunk and the stash house with the pump
Not when God's got his hands on me only the strong survive
And the weak minded are falling by the wayside
But with success comes a great responsibility
Better get prescriptions filled cause there might not be tomorrow
If y'all don't know me by now
Ain't it crazy how your life seems to play out like a movie
I'm truly one of the baddest motherfuckers to ever do it
Kept a plethora of pussy on deck before the money
Operation grind and stack cause these rappers are out of touch
When my feet touch the ground
When I peep all around
And I'm feeling all loved
From the way that you stared
For the joy of that I'm there
And I'm feeling all loved
Been ten toes down to those familiar with the sound
When my feet touch the ground
When I peep all around
And I'm feeling all loved
From the way that you stared
For the joy of that I'm there
And I'm feeling all loved
In the beginning they say Eve bit it
They're still sinning
Therefore I'm quick to not believe in it
Like the weed with the seeds in it
Now proceed like a G pimping
And some of the things you've probably seen in your life
Made you think a certain kinda way about finding your wife
Than to never have it at all and ball on these hoes
Took a gamble caught it at forty and now it's over six
Some say the preacher's daughters are some of the freakiest ones
They been deprived of fun and now they just wanna cut loose
And by the time they do they barely have nobody left over
The thrill has been killed so let the truth be told
Of your sweet red delicious love
I'm mister wrong but she sure know not to
Then I'll rub this stick on your chick like a violin
It's all you want these days cause you feel nothing inside
My music sounds so good it's almost like we're having sex
Whether you like it or not I'm next
Not only about cheddar
But what about the seasons never change and the weather stays the same
It's all you want these days cause you feel nothing inside
I ask for a slice of her pie
She gave me a hug and on her thigh she felt my buddy
From touching I'm excited
I thought I knew you but your heart is almost blind
I thought I knew you but your heart is blind
I thought I knew you but your heart is almost blind
30 karats in the Rollie for the bitches and the hoes
Hanging out the window of a Bentley
Say you want a hundred bricks well I bet I get it
Big diamonds in my Cuban
And now they only call me Daddy Fat Sax
That means worldwide like a rising tide
I'm gonna subside and rise again like clockwork
I'm convinced that we started the California brush fires
And I love chicks with ass so it arch like St. Louis
But we know I'm rich and pay the bills at my mother house
They stay out all night on the basketball court
She said she love me when I'm gone
She miss me being home
I'm always at the studio that makes her alone
Recently she even seems to hate on all my songs
Deleted my pictures took my face up out her phone
Close my eyes and fly away but no blinking
I'm just dreaming she ain't really screaming
It goes both ways and I was trying to get even
Lost my whole evening mostly for no reason and
Came home late I just put the key in
It would probably be straight if she was European
She's not she's hot and mad as she can be
If you can hate on anybody girl I'm glad it was me
Well let's leave pronto and that's what we did
Then we yelled out Geronimo and jumped off that bridge
The shoe still fits but I'm wearing out the sole
Sometimes I really feel as if I'm burning out my soul
I should have a live band preparing for my show
But instead everybody keeps dick riding my flow
Forgive me if I raise my voice I won't raise a hand
But one thing I will do baby is raise my little man
And it's you that's on my computer screen
And it's you that's on my computer screen
The world is yours as soon as you log on
Pretend that this life is but a dream then reality syncs in
The fantasy begins and it never ends
Now we're trapped in the matrix
And it's you that's on my computer screen
And it's you that's on my computer screen
That's what they shoving down our throat so I choke
By way of West Savannah
And it's you that's on my computer screen
And it's you that's on my computer screen
I know it doesn't seem too conventional
But it'll do until I get you in the physical
And it's you that's on my computer screen
And it's you that's on my computer screen
The flash memory that I'll hold is all I know of time
What was waiting all along is all I have to realize
I've got the dial tone
And it's you that's on my computer screen
And it's you that's on my computer screen
I brought one chain for medallion
With a whole lot of motherfucking diamonds
It's astounding like when I be rhyming
Always shining like the sun and moon
Like a hot air balloon requires fire
We shining like the sun and moon
All of your wishes falling through
They chasing after you
And climbing up the moon
We shining like the sun and moon
All of your wishes falling through
They chasing after you
And climbing up the moon
Pretty model bitch with me moving bout as graceful as a gazelle
Just in case this funky ass bitch was doing Intel
Grown ass women ride a Bentley that's so clear
Mama phony but I swear to God the pussy dope and she delicious
We shining like the sun and moon
All of your wishes falling through
They chasing after you
And climbing up the moon
We shining like the sun and moon
All of your wishes falling through
They chasing after you
As the world shakes unharmed
Negative energy not tolerated
You all about a dollar and I'm exonerated
Mama used to say take your time
Well I'm a pickpocket when I design rhymes
Every little step I take like Bob Brown
And It's so profound that when I throw those nouns
You know I keep a full plate
I got everything I can need
Mind riddle every socket for you
Just floating won't drop
That's what mama told me
That's what mama told me
Depending on the grind is the only way to shine
So I'm feeling like that odds is the only state of mind
Cause man gave us laws and God gave us time
It's the art of storytelling and I'm only telling mine
Have always been why I've lost
It changes all the time
I'm happier when I lose what I've needed all my life
Like the baby in the manger
I gave my life to Jesus because he could protect me from the dangers
Attended Sunday school but it felt like it was every day though
They say we get lower than an alligator's navel
Have always been why I've lost
It changes all the time
I'm happier when I lose what I've needed all my life
Through this dead beat town
Through this dead beat town
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down
What about the people that's barefoot
We'll run up in your house like the first runner up
And now we're looking at the top of the pile
Or the king of the mountain gonna knock him off
Got all the dough and all the women
To the moon and back with a cure for cancer
Now that's the answer to the question
But they make money of the medicine
Leaving us all stuck in elections
Through this dead beat town
Through this dead beat town
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down
It's funny how the beloved become the beheaded
The truth can be independent or the direction that you stretch it
Every time my name is brought up better know it's mogul talk
That's why she give me geek till her shins weak
You're running from your life that you didn't see
That's like playing hide and seek with the Grim Reaper
Through this dead beat town
Through this dead beat town
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down
Spent your whole life trying to escape
When everybody stayed
Getting tired of living in a lie
And when the pawns are playing themselves
I just lay and wait and straighten myself
Through this dead beat town
Through this dead beat town
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down
You can fight and try to get away
But there's no way to run and hide to
You better know that there will come a day
When I seen her walking down the street she was pretty thick
And if you see how she work the stroll
That body was out of control
Ain't no way I was about to let her go
I ran my game like I was supposed
And if you see how she work the stroll
That body was out of control
Ain't no way I was about to let her go
I ran my game like I was supposed
When I seen her walking down the street she was pretty thick
Sometimes I wonder how I get over
The weight of everything is tearing up my sober
Shit is heavy like the world on my shoulder
People telling me be strong like a soldier
But I suffer tremendous damage
Just make it fade away
Just let it fade away
Just make it fade away
I suffer tremendous damage
So many things that I didn't know
But still I've seen my dreams come true
And now the little kids are watching my videos
No matter what ever I go through
I told the man in the mirror keep pushing on
But I can't say the same about you
And ain't no way I'm gonna turn back
I started out with no car
And graduated to a Cadillac
But all that money don't mean a got damn thing to me
Sometimes I wonder how I get over
The weight of everything is tearing up my sober
Shit is heavy like the world on my shoulder
People telling me be strong like a soldier
But I suffer tremendous damage
Just make it fade away
Just let it fade away
Just make it fade away
I suffer tremendous damage
And ever since that day I've seen him fade away with my own eyes
My daddy fought in Vietnam
This is a fun fact for the bloodline of Antwan Andre
Just like this song say
And since the days of Player's Ball
Y'all thought it was about all these broads and slamming Cadillac doors
Now your American idol is just a fraud
Practice make perfect and first it was Bamboo now it's Cross
Sometimes I wonder how I get over
The weight of everything is tearing up my sober
Shit is heavy like the world on my shoulder
People telling me be strong like a soldier
But I suffer tremendous damage
Just make it fade away
Just let it fade away
Just make it fade away
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
By now you should know us
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
From the bottom of my chest to my stomach
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
I wanna get in higher res
I wanna see it on the sick screen
I wanna put it on the five point one
I just want to get it on
I wanna get in higher res
And bathing in the fog dog
She about this lumberjack so she gonna get this log cause
Her natural habitat is a bang bang
I wanna get in higher res
I wanna see it on the sick screen
I wanna put it on the five point one
I just want to get it on
I wanna get in higher res
How you wanna give it to me
I know you wanna get it in
I wanna get in higher res
I wanna see it on the sick screen
I wanna put it on the five point one
I just want to get it on
Bifocals because my vocals are classic
I meant to say blow in the ingredients
Little bitty ass clothes
A connoisseur of cannabis and from Atlanta bitch
Some of the game rules done changed
Riding and talking dirty on my cellular
You dipping in the cookie jar and now you're sprung
I'll have you tripping like you smoking furl
Got it popping like a skillet with some chicken grease in it
Thinking that the key to life is putting your business on Maury
I know the truth so ain't no need in your lying
She wanna skip the winter just to shake it in the summer
Strippers on the pole and they going up and down
Touching on your nipples mighty long take a seat girl
Wanna introduce you to my mighty long
And dance to songs it could take you all night long
See no I'm no David Copperfield but I'm sure I can pull a rabbit
Uh stank ya smelly much
But this is the only hairy bush I would like to put my lips on
Pop goes the weasel when I explode in her mouth boy that's cold
And I'm a peaceful person so she wanted to give me piece of mind
Now it appears that I am brain dead
My legs feel like Joe from Family Guy because she got insane head
Call me crazy but nowadays it seems like nothing is sacred
I just wanna give you all my time
Girl I want you to climb on top of me
Girl on top of me babe
I think it's time for us to stir the pot
Like the feelings in the bitter broad
Because she hurt a lot and yes I
Been aboard because I work a lot
Riding a huffy or my little brother
Till she say that she love me
Raps Underground Railroad but
We stay blooming like its spring break
Flower child Cadillac look like cheese plate
Crack a smile like a gator with his mouth close
Or crocodiles from the Nile yeah we cop those
Calendar booked like library got shows
Or you can ask me for my help I'll send a life boat
Keep the party going never was a killjoy
That's me in third person sometimes I get beside myself
Everything quotable bitch remember this
Till the last bitch emcee eliminated uses his dying breath
To proclaim he the most lyrical
God they done damned up
What I know so far true fusion only occurs
Cause that dodo thought that he could rob a player for some dough tho
No S is on my chest but all these diamonds got me blessed
Got that Southern drawl and all that
Like clocks in the wintertime
We stay eating like it's dinnertime
But it ain't no reefer round
We don't know the meaning of drought
Just speaking in general
While there is no formidable
When they down and out
I build a bear before I build a bitch
I take her to the mall and fill her with the sugar dick
And by the time I gave her back she was burnt out
Give them something to remember
Do you really know the meaning of life or are you sleeping
Give them something to remember
Give them something to remember
We gonna see it through
They wanna know what's going on in the south
My jewels so cold that you might get the slight flu
You wanna see me locked 24 just like cops do
Gang Mentality I think like the mob do. Police brutality
I'm strapped like a cop fool. My dope bowl do numbers

If I ever got a question about how it's supposed to be
They know who I am and they all got love for me
Conversations with myself
If I ever got a question about how it's supposed to be
They know who I am and they all got love for me
Conversations with myself
Old school players to new school fools
It's true when I say that I don't lose
Only when I'm in Texas on Vogues
Octopuses spill the ink
Still a freak of nature when this ballpoint hit this paper
If I ever got a question about how it's supposed to be
They know who I am and they all got love for me
Conversations with myself

The biggest liars of them all
I set fire in the mind and the hearts of the men
That wanna clap but it pop off
Restitution ain't solution for the lives that have been lost
By the time you hear this song
While the killers be at home
Now my dealers keep that chrome
But my style cannot be cloned
Timeless classics on you bastards
Jedi rap shit all day long
You know exactly who to come and get
Miss me with that sucker shit
If I said it then I meant it
Ain't apologizing partner
That's some real shit
Said the music lacking feeling
I play the block in a foolish coupe
Watch they ass go Helen Keller
So many days for y'all to try
I bought a new AK today
I understand exactly why he shouldn't fuck with us
That's why every dime is making money
Got it down to a science yeah she study
Since the beginning of time
She say she wanna see me
But I got me somebody
I tell her see you next lifetime
Then she will never go away
To me drilling for babies
Now she know that I know
That we know we fucking
Forever in the friend zone
I'm falling for her plans
She's got me eating out her hands
See that's just my friend
And we gone let you do the math
That's why every dime is making money
Got it down to a science yeah she study
Since the beginning of time
Now anytime I wanna get down I hit her line
Round after round while pipe touch spine
Mine is the kind when you just touch down
You had a long flight but you wanna buss now
Or later like the candy come out them panties please
She say she wanna see me
But I got me somebody
I tell her see you next lifetime
Then she will never go away
To me drilling for babies
I'm falling for her plans
She's got me eating out her hands
See that's just my friend
And we gone let you do the math
That's why every dime is making money
Got it down to a science yeah she study
Since the beginning of time
Follow me into a land where impalas squat
Mannie Fresh on the beat he put that wobble on it
I'm like the bandage on mummy I got that wrap around
Catch me outside and we can see what
All that yapping bout
Gladiators with radiators that run hot
My uncle told me don't pull it unless you pop pop
I'm from Atlanta by way of Savannah Georgia
Be easy when you see me salute me and keep it bailer
Only tigers comes with stripes I piped it up for
Follow me into a land where impalas squat
Had for some years now to me it's like a trophy
I trust her so I know she gone do it just how I showed her
I'm only high when I'm really in the act of smoking
Double up something convertibles a make a bitch
And I done turned corners in a couple of em
Back in studio hustling bitch we cook drugs in here
You was living under false impressions
Follow me into a land where impalas squat
Say we can do what millionaires can can can
And what we smoking come from Oakland via San Fran
Country boy proud mane smoking loud mane
Follow me into a land where impalas squat
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you
You say you were so sick of it
Cause the ivory is clean
On the inside of the ship
Not a honey dip to hunt on
Or the Blue Man Group
Caught out on the Vegas Strip
My brain is on one track
Like Mary Mary toss for crackle like a rock star does for smack
From them female fantasies frolic freely
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you
You say you were so sick of it
All men young or old in the end it's what we after
Hey let me get about three of them blue diamonds
I promise I got you tomorrow
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you
You say you were so sick of it
We just need to keep this thing friendly and hush hush
Buffoon you are too consumed in the womb
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you
You say you were so sick of it
I move with the elegance of an African elephant
I presented the evidence
Eloquent as the president
Evident is the emphasis
I deserve me a championship
But before I banana clip
Little man against Hellion
With the heart of an orphan
I got the words of a murderer
And an eye for distortion
You take a slice of my portion
I'll take a piece of your profit
I drive at illegal speeds
Keep an oz in my pocket
We run the jewels in your town
A quarter pound on my person
I'm known for pounding the stage
I'm talking burning and cursing
Producer gave me a beat
Said it's the beat of the year
I got stools and a rope
Haranguing the land with a man's flow
A new edition to the art of the old code
That's fully retarded and put a part in your bold dome
Or worse yet be the reason your girl want a divorce
Radiation leak at Mile Island
Also known as Chernobyl talk
Listen for the sirens
For the green I'm a hoarder
You're the poor distorter
You suck a good dick for the fame
And couldn't resist getting played
I fuck like I'm headed to war
I'm really not playing no games
But tag me god damn it I'll kill the carrier mentions my name
If they refuse to run the jewels we beat the bottoms of feet
Is where we staying when they corpses resting under our feet
I sent they mom a little cash and a sympathy letter
Told her she raised a bunch a fuck boys
Being dumbed down by the local radio stations by designing
My bank account obese as fuck while yours sits on a diet
If we broke up and she took half I'd still be sitting on commas
Crocodile on my feet fox fur on my back
Crocodile on my feet fox fur on my back
Smack on smack on some of this dick Tracy
You took her to the club and now her body is full of liquor
Off that Butterscotch Schnapps and Bailey's Irish Cream
She's a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things
Crocodile on my feet fox fur on my back
Crocodile on my feet fox fur on my back
To put on a pair of panties much less a pair of jeans or the leotard
But I got to start by complimenting you on your physique
But it takes years of perseverance and experience to get that cat
So why don't I chase this Hennessey down with some of that
As we strut skip the line through the glass window glance
Throw your hands up if you feel me
Throw your hands up if you feel me
Crocodile on my feet fox fur on my back
Never judge a person or a book by it's covers
That we drop a little science off in every verse
Than the park bench to start this
All my brothers from my momma but Andre is just the same
A player stiffen the competition
Penelope Ann Cruz couldn't snooze
I take a submarine two thousand leagues below the sea
And try to grab one line or sentence
And give him a clean bill of health
Wealth might make you look good but you sound like shit
This young player's rhyme
Like a young Cassius Clay in his prime
The epitome of raw rhyme
Murderous monster move minds
Keep that funk for y'all
When I'm in the mood I rock the S Dot tennis shoes
Dudes wanna know what he copped
Anybody get out of line then you trust
Who knows why we won't stop
It goes on and on and on...
Who knows why we won't stop
It goes on and on and on...
We got them cars Black Range Rover wit bars
Y'all don't want to make them start
When I say get out my face don't preach
They do it right then
Three mo blocks two mo owes
Just bailed in off them dangerous streets
Fresh off a Lick 5 G's a piece
Calhoun Jeans brand new ride pockets fat
Magic City right around the block
But I think I'm gonna catch the crib
Its about to be a girl fight
I need to get this off my chest
And if her friend want some then she'll be next
It really ain't that complicated
Want some plates come on let's make it
You're about to catch one right in your lip
We're on our way to the neighborhood
Don't forget that I got some wit me
Bout to el elbows all in your grain
You're about to catch one right in your lip
Oh snap these bitches they act like cats
In the middle of the dance floor now they're preparing to scrap
And the one on the left is the other woman
We right outside your door
We right outside your door
I'm your kinky operator when you want to fuck something
It's the player from the point and your girl from the d
I could end your curiosity
If you don't think I'm too rude
Here's your chance to make your move
I sit and wait for nobody
People say that my style is so crazy
I dare you to undress me
With this hip hop star
I have none to waste with you
I dare you to undress me
Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers
First check her brain to see if she's sane
Deranged or strange or crazy as hell
You never can tell these days
He's all the way live
See where I come from
He just twist caps off
And let the girl like me understand it
And the ones that ain't
They still gotta have it
We don't like them there
He knows how to treat a lady
But he won't let you get too rowdy
He stands up for himself
That's what I like most about him
He's all I see and all I need
And all that I'm used to
I swear that my man's the truth
I said I swear that my man's the truth
We don't like them there
We don't like them there
That's right stand by
We shake the haters and gets busy
You say you wanna do same thing
I know you know the history
Grind all the time to stay hot
Like sunshine and cold north through summertime
We don't like them there
Playing field ain't leveling the lane
Lord have mercy but we be having that jersey
Fast life like born on Wednesday and died on Thursday
Slow my roll like break pads
I'm on this one way headed where the slums play
All white but the Phantom is all black
Minus the love feel like I was something to hate
Everybody looking now
I used to have dark nights now it's bright lights
Had a poor man swag now it's priced right
But this ain't physics or rocket science
This a little tune to keep you motivated and inspired
I am not a motivational speaker but people get easily motivated
When they hear BIG reeking
Rocking alligator shoes I'm on
Rather live alone forever than live a lie
My ambition is ammunition if this is war
My only dream to get rich and never marry
Remember they used to be like who is this
Now I'm up in this bitch
Smoking weed out in London they bringing me fish and chips
Who know this be the life that I really live
Older people looking at me how I bought all of this
Took something rough and turn it to a diamond
I'll be back on the same night
Me and my dogs we on the same flight
Carefree I don't need the stress
I'm from College Park where we move that weed and we slang that blow
Get dope on a daily basis
My blunts I don't be lacing
Come to my crib tonight
Let me beat that puss all night
Run tell your buddies I fucked you right
Make a judge lean like he sipping syrupy
Twist a jay of some hay
To my underground bungalow
Now I'm done so see ya
So maybe we can find sum place to go
I'm here for you my dear
You don't have to go home
With the homeboy burning sacs
We heading to the spot where we get down
They can stay the night
You don't have to go home
Make sure they see you when you roll
Hop out that truck all ready fucked up
Tore up from the motherfucking floor up
Smoke kiss in the walls in the top of the building
Smelling like hen and a mix of hydroponic by the the time
My click find me in VIP I'm lost in a cloud of chronic had sex
You don't have to go home
Truck still rattling and bumping now move something
Sac keeps shaking and block keep jumping
With the click in the truck
Full of chick in the back of the 6
The horns are making me horny.
Me and Rick James got the same birthday.
Simply means I'll grill you from Thursday to Thursday.
So we can have a baby boy or a baby girl. To Chuck E.
We here in a remote area
Somewhere way back up in the woods
With members of the elite Dungeon Family
Like a junkie on powder I go hard every line
I'm destined to become a millionaire
Similar to Phil Collins I can feel it in the air
My car change colors like a million airs
I put it in the air and bust your brain
Better pray God with him when I catch his ass
Pardon my French but if you give me an inch
Nearly one million sold but I'm still in that world
You know the type of bread that don't involve accountants
We ain't them boys that you can't say earned it
On the low straight out the oven like some blueberry muffins
We have found proof of sound of our ground
The Dungeon Family is here to stay and we don't give a flying fuck
The lab is filled with potions of emotions out the ass
I laugh when you think that you have seen the last
North Korea got that shit that make LA look like Japan
You know the W that come from Dirty Bast
As a King standing on the terrace
While his partner pointing up at the riflemen
And if one come then this the motto
Now I put message in bottle
You go to the nearest beach and open your car door
And walk to the place where the sea meets the land
I will take y'all little ass to school
Crack and I have a lot in common
Unfortunate that if you come up fortunate the streets consider you lame
I guess it ain't. What a shame
I don't slang. Never slung but I'm one with the slum
That's when I broke into my Big Rube impression
And I tried to enlighten but that night I learned a lesson
That the morals that you think you got go out the window
And your child is down on her knees praying hard up to God
For a Whopper with cheese
Dare make an honest living or make a crooked killing
You put your left foot back in and then you shake it all about
I've been hard since I was solo
I bang and then I hang out at the Staples like Blake Griffin
You can tell I'm getting money the way that glass house is sitting
Them boys want they music on blast
Them boys want they music on blast
Why can't a motherfucker chill in the car
They must know that I got bird stashed all up in my grill
Camouflage by the armor all while it's sparkling off my wheels
And you say to yourself that he is broke
Can't get to the phone right now because my boss is all in this bitch mouth
I'm the lightning that strikes twice
You can embrace it or come face to face with total devastation
They'll do anything for money while misleading the village
You can trot around the planet or watch it on the news
Blue collared day to day workers
That squeeze a dollar so they baby can swallow
But it's a million dollars a gallon for some gas to get to work
You Rob Peter to pay Paul to make due
Make you wanna write a note and take a pistol to that bank too
And pass it to the teller but you know better
They trying to tell us to stay strong
But every day we losing jobs
From College Park out to Beverly Hills
Across the world they live in fear
But it's the same thing over here
If you can hear me on Capitol Hill
Subject matter don't matter because the verse is empty
No food for thought nothing for the brain to digest
So I guess it'd be about who can bullshit the best
But I give them light on like the traffic I direct
Inspiring their life like they was actors on my set
I'd be a liar if I wasn't sick and tired of this mess
They trying to tell us to stay strong
Nut every day we losing jobs
From College Park out to Beverly Hills
Across the world they live in fear
But it's the same thing over here
If you can hear me on Capitol Hill
Single mother in a struggle and it's no fun
But you don't really understand until you are one
A child is sick and is losing he's endurance
Now we don't even want to talk about the man's life
But a felon has no chance for a new start
So it's back to doing hand in hand on his own block
And blacks and whites we're all the same and I know you feel my pain
And the only hope I have to help me deal with the drama
They trying to tell us to stay strong
But everyday we losing jobs
From College Park out to Beverly Hills
Across the world they live in fear
But it's the same thing over here
If you can hear me on Capitol Hill
Free your mind or be stuck like porcupine left behind
That's the bottom line gotta find the grind
Step on the stars while you're reaching for the sun
And child was gonna be okay
I heard him say that they would bring
Our soldiers home in one piece today
The world is too big but it's not that way
They've been selling us a dream telling us
Now we all gotta deal with the lies
They trying to tell us to stay strong
But everyday we losing jobs
From College Park out to Beverly Hills
Across the world they live in fear
But it's the same thing over here
If you can hear me on Capitol Hill
Now there's nobody at home
A moving vehicle took my family
As I slept out on the sofa in the Boom Boom Room
I throw the covers back and peek through the draperies
Like Princess Di before she died
Therefore we tried and tried again
But in the end you pay attention to the pluses
You build it up to break it down and now take it from the start
Repeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash
The love has kissed the canvas
Now the whole family is mad at me
My daughter don't want me at her PTA meetings
I can't dismiss the matter of the fact because he saw you and me argue
Now the energy is coming back
I take your pain away
Some people talk about ya
Like they know all about ya
When you get down they doubt ya
And when you dip it on the scene
They love it or they hate it
You dance up on them haters
Keep getting funky on the scene
Ladies and gentlemen the funkiest
Horn section in Metropolis
We call that Classy Brass
If I play the ukulele
Just like a little lady
If I play the ukulele
Just like a little lady
As I play the ukulele
Just like a little lady
It's your homeboy straight from the A T
I know some hoes slutty
Serving up emotion once you deep inside that tomb
But I pull up on your block in the 500 Benz drop
Mr. Poke Em with the Noodle
Swimming in the fallopian of an Ethiopian
Serving up emotion once you deep inside that tomb
Over a million sold on strictly weed and bricks
Flammable like gasoline when I'm lit up
I prefer my liquor dark and a mean white slut
You can fool the record labels but not the street fame
Serving up emotion once you deep inside that tomb
It's just a phase you might hear strolling through the A Town
Thinking way back before I got mine
Putting bullet holes through the neighborhood stop signs
I'm stuck in the air with weed crumbs under my cuticles
Serving up emotion once you deep inside that tomb
Fourth and goal should I take the three point field goal
But I know one day we will once more cross paths
We just split it down the middle
So you can see both the visions
Just so you all know what time it is
We Dungeon Family all day long baby
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
The kings have arrived
Hey forever I'm on the grind
My mind is already made up
Everyday that I make up
I look up at Christ and think
Therefore he lifts me up
So I don't see no haters
You ever seen a black man
And I'm a try to ignore ya
And I'm a have to come for ya
And I won't go get your lawyers
Just make ya wanna groove
I started from the bottom
But I'm destined for the top
Call me clumsy for the weight
Like the fuse on my cannon
Top shelf you gotta reach high to be the best
And no I ain't gonna rest
And make this music that we sang on
Always got my stink on
Does this make ya wanna groove
Just make ya wanna groove
I started from the bottom
But I'm destined for the top
Call me clumsy for the weight
Like the fuse on my cannon
Here we go back again
I don't give a damn about a broad
I ain't gotta floss in the fast lane
Just to make my change rang
Does this make ya wanna groove
Just make ya wanna groove
I feel high on the music
I feel high on the music
They don't believe me yet baby
Party people in the place
Embrace the bass as I commence to pick up the pace
But rappers keep wishing to be in my position
Know good and damn well they ain't no competition
Cause that would mean you would have to teach
Each and every one idiotic son
The rhymes I recite are fully dressed and yours are butt naked
You know you heard this voice before somewhere
That brother that used to rhyme on stage with Biz
But this time I'm not assisted on the microphone
Is the real thing like the taste of Coke
I take time and care in whatever I'm doing
Joy what you're hearing as I entertain
I got the freedom of speech to use it anyway that I choose it
So all hail to the music
The original supreme being Black man
As those go below like a submarine
Reaching and teaching a lesson that I'm giving
So pardon this brother as I give you mine
I say the end will be
And that's coming from a Black man's point of view
Now pardon me for just changing the issue
The way y'all be fronting has made me disgusted
Rappers try and hang and just swear that they can party
But the style that I'm using is just like karate
So if we ever battle you're bound to be through
Because I got a black belt in Rap Can Do
That destroy an MC with black belt degrees
So I get the party kicking just like Bruce Lee
I relieve rappers just like Tylenol
When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt
The Sage of Rage is what rap did to me
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem
And captivate the whole crowd's majority
The rhymes I use definitely amuse
Better than Dynasty or Hill Street Blues
I work like a slave to become a master
The minute that the Kane starts to go on
Believe it's gonna be smooth sailing so sail on
As I put other rappers out of their misery
The meaning of RAW is Ready And Willing
And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd
I rip the microphone and leave it scarred
So if we battle on the microphone
Bring your own casket and tombstone
Rock the discotheques and this groove is what's next
I keep the crowd loud when you're hype
So let's all sing the Big Daddy anthem
But my apparatus is up to status
Save the bass for the pipe and rearrange your tone
Or take a loss and be forced in the danger zone
So just stand still and chill as I build
Science I drill until my rhymes fill
Your head up... don't even get up
You ever had to confront me and you can bet that
Stand in command with the clan
Without further ado or any delay
As the microphone lord proceeds to get raw
And if you still want some... set if off
For you to cope is just a wish and a hope
The lyrics I bring them keeps the crowd hyper
As I release the masterpiece
Talk about ever meeting Ms. Right
But one thing I know is this girl is hype
Not a crab I see but such a lovely female
For raving all over with exotic beauty
And to captivate her love is my only duty
There's not a single feature that this girl lacks
You've got me waiting for you day by day
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away
So I'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine
Now I've talked to young girls and sophisticated ladies
With the right female and in detail
Cause every time I appear to be pleased
And no one can stop the feelings that you inspire
The way that you leave me in this obsession
With the chambers of my heart in your possession
Pray for the day that we combine
And I can say for sure that you're truly mine
In benevolence and reverence
As soon as our relationship commence
For the day that you can give your all to me
The moment of truth is what I really should call it
I worked so hard for it so please don't spoil it
Yeah it's a lot that I'm asking you to give me
That's only because I need you with me
You as my girl and Kane as your man
I wanted her to step inside my arena
And show you what a real man is made of
My feelings I'm sharing because I'm caring
For a chance at romance I would love to enhance
I would be your man under any circumstance
Just as long as I can say that you're my own
Your feelings for me and mine alone
We can cherish every moment of the time we spent
Try to take our love to the full extent
The point that I'm trying so hard to get through
A dramatic fanatic for our relation
Cupid has me stupid with infatuation
And a fashion of passion so tenderly
With vibes I can't describe you send to me
This personal attachment in which I feel
Because to see you with the next man makes me cry
I feel that I should be the only man to side you
Cause no one can love you the way that I do
No one deserve the love you can give
So allow me to show you how I'm out to live
That you would know that my love is something special to keep
And drop some smooth lyrics
And ain't no half stepping
Rappers stepping to me they want to get some
They can't get with me
I'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
Competition I just devour
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
Ready to die because you're petty
My rhymes are so dope and
The rappers be hoping
Then again on second thought
It's quite confusing for you to remember
The best oh yes I guess suggest the rest should fess
Don't mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraph I manifest
Have a break from a take of me acting ill
Next the formation of words that fit
And devour with the power of Hercules
Cause you could scalp my cameo and I'll still have strength
Be sleeping on your rhymes till I start to snore
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare
So on to be want to be competition
The creator conductor of poetry
I speak clearly so you can understand
Because I always speak with mentality
I'll just break him and bake him and rake him
And take him and mold him and make him
Hold up the peace sign...
The one they call the Big Daddy Kane is here
To deliver a message to everyone everywhere
So listen up party people cause this you should hear
That you will find very rare and far beyond compare
All is sincere and rather debonair
Off to a place you thought was unreal
Where people of the world do know how to chill
Everything remains cool and calm where you are
They wouldn't even know what you mean
Where people work hard for a decent buck
And you can wear truck jewelry without being stuck
Never wondering whether your house is all right
So go leave your VCR on the porch overnight
And as for the people they all stand proud
You can hang at a jam till the break of dawn
Everyone walks around in their right mind and all
Because crack ain't nothing but a hole in the wall
So those who wish to live with glare and flair
What I discovered may just only seem
As something that you find in your wildest dream
There is a place people live with joy
That the next man cannot come along and destroy
And war ain't nothing but a game on Atari
This message also applies to other nations
Ethiopians can eat in Red Lobster for free
And people that you saw before that were poor
Will never ever see the situation no more
Cause in this world everyone's a millionaire
Fashions are smashing for all to flaunt
And we can get anything that we want
So don't think you can't afford expensive design
So come ye all and attend this affair
Since I'm the type of guy that laughs and jokes
It's a shame that people today must live
In a world that's operating oh so negative
But I found a place designed especially for you
Where peace and harmony is everyone's culture
So let's all gather around before this world corrupts
We came here to just motherfucking do
Got my man Marley Marl in the house
Juice Crew in the house
We gonna do a little something like this I say...
Tour from New York to South Dakota
Drink ginger ale or root beer soda
Never get the girls with the underarm order
Once knew a girl by the name of Rhoda
I watch Star Wars just to see Yoda
Maybe Commando or the Terminator
To me getting paid and getting busy fall together
That I be using and not many can manage
Giving party people something funky to listen to
I stomp them out just like I was King Kong
I go on and on and on and
Until the bright Shirley Murdock morning
Never use a barbershop I got my homeboy Smooth
Cooling out with the clippers right around the way
To keep my fresh Cameo cut every day
The verdict that I reach for you is rather blurry
But my rhymes will remain like a hieroglyphic
He goes by the name of the Big Daddy Kane
As the rhythm of this starts to flow
Get up and dance cause the Kane said so
This is the dance floor groove of the album
Presented to you all live from Calvin
Check out the way that my DJ is sounding
On the turntables to keep the crowd stable
Killing the cuts putting bodies on a record label
And just for the symphony
Taking a stand like a band
Hit some of them transformers hops
I go by the name of Big Daddy Kane
Now he come from NA Rock
They come from the place known as Brownsville
And he come from the area known as the Bridge
You done said all your names on your record
It's time to say names on my record now
My man Shep Love and the entire LG Posse
I wanna say what's up to my man Moose Love
I want to say what's up to Nicola
Get wise to the exercise
Listen to the rap allow it to trap
Your body and soul so that you can adapt
To the man on display as I take you away
Proud to be a Black man
Giving up to brothers five on the back hand
Pray for lease and peace upon each other
With my sisters and brothers
Tackled and shackled our ancestors
Country that we all came from
Because the moral of it all is we shall overcome
The cream will keep rising
Building and building to carry on
All the way from Malcolm X to Farrakhan
Those who fell victim were those without scruples
So hold up the peace sign and stand together
Take heed to the words that I manifest
Take a stand the fight for power
Living superior abiding by nature
The history of the Asiatic one paid the
Price to be paid in slavery
Like the name of Antonio was gave to me
But knowledge of self broke every shackle and chain
Now I declare myself as the Big Daddy Kane
So discover the truth of one another
But the color of black is most dominant
The rising and sizing can never cease
As we send this out to New York City
Can't forget the posse down in Philly
Let it rain let it rain to be put it pain
To leave a stain plain to remain in my lane
Or be funky like a underarm
They come a dime a dozen but the Kane look cuter
Because the purpose I serve is to please ya
So bust a pimp without a limp
Get loose I put a boost and used to chill
So never touch tap tangle or tamper
But I can roast an MC like a barbecue
Child you shouldn't even bother
So let me school ya plus scoop your female
And smooth to the groove with lyrics that sooth
Been enhanced by the mentally divine
To break and make my foes dispose in force
So y'all can see how me the Kane will just reign
Got Nice and Smooth in the place to be
Can't forget my man Ant Live
Here comes the conquering brother that fathoms and never ceases.
That are left behind as you're left to find
They rap a brief moment and then shut up.
Lips are sealed because all of this is real.
And all the product you sell is real dangerous
These are the games that a fool would play today
For our own kind to decay.
Just scavengers in search of...
They can't understand to see a black man
And then they assume that I'm a drug dealer.
Then come get this when you're ready for business
Because they can't drop rhymes like these.
So pay attention as I mention the 411.
They all be afraid they won't get paid
The righteous with a walk in success and be strong.
A brother like the Big Daddy Kane is peace with
The kiss of death on a rap pick
It only takes one punch to get the head flown
Cause the Kane got more spice than curry
I am the flavor down on paper
Rhymes that'll sting your face like a quick jab
Rhymes they're worth their weight in
And for a rapper to challenge my freestyle
So many slept on the nonchalant act
Now wake up sucker this is mortal combat
Captivate the crowd but you can't understand
And I don't have beef with no other performer
Keep to myself never bother another
Or even bow to your knees and below
Or get played like a game of Nintendo
I ain't a child that's why I don't smile
I combine a line designed to find behind the mind
Looks like a job for King Asiatic
Feel the wrath of a Big Daddy raw rhyme
Be alert for where I drop the bomb at
As I destroy you with mortal combat
I roll so bold with soul control the whole patrol
If you ever try to step to the Big Daddy Kane
I rank supreme and it's a rapper's dream
To scheme and fiend for my technique but redeem
Cause there's only room for one teacher
Peace to the brothers and sisters that follow me
Plenty poisoned minds of the people are ours
That's the reason before I drop this bomb
On and on and on and on
Me say the beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Nor does the growth of our young world
Cause you are the cream of the planet earth
To take flight and ignite to a brand new height
So out of the MERCY of Allah
For what I'm about to say
To obey okay so let the man build
Words of rapture that you have to capture
And I just slapped ya
With the hand full of literature
That's dope def fresh hype choice smooth and raw
Competition you must be on freebase
You're still cold off the road for the role you stole
Those who dispute get treated just like a prostitute
They get the boot and played like a flute
Because you're petty confetti and not ready to rock steady
But when it come to hype rhymes I got one
Just like the album is still the same
I still get ill and kill at will and build the skill
To fill your grill so don't tell me you're real
You'd be another memory to us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
It's a benefit for you and me
The chosen one that has turned a new leaf
With the knack to attract the pack
And just go with the flow you know
In the place to be with my man Marley Marl
Can't forget my main man Heavy D
Flow and go to a slow tempo and you know
But I'm not animated like a cartoon
I thrash bash clash mash and ten more
And reach the blind to find their way from A to Z
Level of def one step beyond dope
You suckers all scope and hope to cope but NOPE
But it still ain't loud enough
Peace in the name of I Self Lord and Master
I come to teach and preach and reach and each
Drop science and build with math
Too many rappers have fronted to get a name out
Your rhymes are more false than dentures
Rhyme or find the time to design a line
I get busy from sun to sun
And just throw your hands in the air
Let's take a ride in stride and I'm the guide
I just wanna get my point across
To seek out fortune without distortion
All chains become awake
We can't take shorts or take a loss
Let's start to do for ourself
We can't depend on no one else or the board of health
So hold your own or else you're gonna find
We gotta put it in overdrive and strive to survive
Effort of strength makes you grow inch by inch
We gotta walk not crawl or else take a fall
What used to be just hopes and thoughts
Because we need unity to find justice
Just I see equality so bust this
Take a stand and command to demand what's grand
I know we can if we just understand
Pick up my pants and thump and thump
Lift her up just like a pick up truck
Then I sat her down and we started to fuck
I hope this time I don't make a cookie
So imitators who wanna step to a
They rub it with oils and suck it with ice
Now I'm sweating... my mind is in paradise...
From my eyesight that was what it seemed
I just got paid and I'll be very glad to treat you
Clearing out my throat so I cold start my smooth talk
My my my my my my my my my
When you commit yourself to someone
Looks like my feelings been united with you baby
But maybe just a little bit too soon
So I put mines in your hands girl
And it's all yours my dear
I thought that I was the star until I saw you
And just talked the entire night away
From that moment on I felt that I knew you
Introducing ladies and gentlemen
Among these classics are tunes that will never die
Because we're on the move.
Gasp your breath as you huff and puff.
It only takes a hickey to make you want a quickie
So I remember those who's on my side.
It begins with an S and ends with an X.
And make sure it's cold so the crew can get naughty.
You get jacked if you ever try to nap
On a a rap from Scrap because you know there's no haps.
Let me give you a true piece of mind
A tall box of hair or rather cameo cuts.
Those that's destined to question for a new thing.
Join us in harmony together as we sing.
For all the ladies determined that once was
I take the cake but you can't get a crumb
I profile a style that's mild and meanwhile
Put on trial a rap pile to exile
And I'm still calm and humble
And if may make this one thing here clear
And I can slice and dice a fisher price MC
That thought he was nice into minute rice
As I design the genuine line
Take two other men with soul that you probably know
The unique technique I speak is all original
You like to sag and drag and gag
Competition may find it spectacular
And this is one thing to us we ain't new to
I'm the man you can't hold back
And all competition appears to be weak
As I give a shout out to my man tony a
And they've gotten a hold on me
Now it's time to see what we can do to solve them
New rule be enforced in school so we can get rid of
All the bad apples in the bunch
Clean up the wall and cook better lunch
Put the students in class where they should be
The job is yours to play the boss enforce the laws
It's up to do so what you gonna do
To resurrect and perfect the entire school around
Our learning ability is increased quadrupled
And we're off to a brand new start
I played my part to prove that you're smart
So take heed to this as a blessing and remember...
So let knowledge uproot ya
And since I got paid and blew up like a live grenade
And I'd just like to thank all of you
And this goes to everybody in the entire world
I just wanna dedicate this one to you
And I just want to say hello
Or should I say peace as I start to release
The poetry that don't cease is never the least
Your feet got to shuffle as I put the muscle in the groove
Once you experience a whole Kane rhyme
With lyrics that's bright as the morning sun
This is that particular beat
I wanna talk about peace and unity and love
Black and white to unite and oh man oh man
A natural born lover with love to give free to ya
I'm just a smooth operator that gets the job done
Cause ever since I was young I could keep girls sprung
Just by the movement of my tongue
I remember it all started way back
And now it's 1990 and you can find me as I dunk
Because the ladies is all I dream of
And not even Anita Baker can give sweeter love
This is a world premier and I'm here
A presentation beyond compare
That means dance as I get smooth with
Poetic perfection that you can groove with
Word to be heard never blurred or slurred
I'm not the type of MC to be merciful
So if your name ain't Jermaine take it personal
Cause like a vigilante I'm gonna kill off any
Sucker MC that tries to withstand me
The verbal law for the Nation of Islam
Wisdom I speak makes your head nod
But many doubt my Knowledge of Self
And that's the reason I don't swine
This is the proper way man should use ink
But you're at your brink and your rhymes are extinct
Before you're put in the Dead Poet's Society
That's how I build and destroy
With a groove so smooth you can't help but get into
My vocabulary will just have you very
That means competition
Total destruction as I rip up the damn stage
The mood for the Smooth Operator to start this flow
I crushed and crushed and stomped the comp that tried
Only one survivor can remain
Where no one could bother me
The rest of that stuff that Alex Haley talks about
They said I'm not from Asia I'm from Africa
And all the blacks there now are just scavengers
That's the way my mind was poisoned
To believe that in America blacks are inferior
A weak mind and a body of swine
Illiterate to who where what and why
I made a few songs that sold OK
Never top 20 or plenty airplay
I had to make that change and rearrange
So now all the pop charts I rule
And none of the black stations ever have played it
I tried to blame it on MTV
Because I wanted the fame
Money is not only the root of all evil
I am having to deal with
Don't need a donut to fill up my dish
I'm not a follower of anyone
So black women put it in your texts
So you can never let opportunity pass you by
The future of the world to be without unity
To reveal what's been hidden a mystery
One black brother sells another one dope
Many of us live on this level
The lifestyle of young ladies today
They need a sincere leader
You gotta use what you got to get what you want
They just ain't no damn good
Now there's this girl named Monique
The type of female that you consider a freak
You think her address is 21 Hump Street
She step out every night to swing
And every Wednesday night at the Apollo
And Monique would be ready to sleep
With the first kid in a Benz or a Cherokee Jeep
I once was infatuated by the things that you do
In order to gain respect from anyone else
Treat yourself like a real woman should
That just ain't no damn good
But check this here out
About this kid by the name of Corey
But every single bill had Washington's face
And he went beyond exaggeration
To lie about his means of transportation
Because he said he had a Benz car
Talk about simple chronic halitosis
He had an odor that just won't quit
Smelled like he washed in Oil Of Oh shit
And couldn't hurt a virgin if her pussy had stitches
So let's get one thing understood
The moral of the story is
The majority of the population of males and females today
That a woman is a man's greatest gift
I've always felt that... it's great to achieve in life
Well I'll tell you my friend
And always say what you mean and mean what you say
Come bring ALL of you to me
When I say I want all of you
I wanna taste everything from your lipstick to your toenail polish
I want you... I want you...
I just wanna lay on the floor and make love to your shadow
Run my fingers through your hair
Start to clap your hands for
My job is to make you all feel this
But my rhymes reach out and touch more people than Ma Bell
The brain of the Kane's so intelligent
That might best describe
The musical vibe you feel when I arrive
From the moment I walk through the door
Get up and dance and move your body across the floor
You came in the disco
You won't have a chance to sit down
And listen to rhymes that go the mile like a marathon
Feel like I'm down here by myself sometimes
I'm ready to break this groove down
Bring in paramedics to relieve the
Trace of this bad case of dance fever
I might move real smooth
Then again dance real silly
Just like a hillbilly
As I make sure the beat is kept
So all the party people stay in step
Become a slave to the rhythm
Grab someone of the opposite sex and dance with em
Put your partner on the floor and face em
That shows a positive sign of unification
And if all party goers could make this move
We'd be one nation under a groove
That can only result in peace from what I sense
To be straight to the point
The treble beyond the level of imagination
So the Big Daddy Kane can endure
And the name of this tune is Keep Em on the Floor
I wanna tell this story
I call this brother Mr. Pitiful
The story begins in 1984
It wasn't quite hard for me to find a woman then
A sexy chocolate guy in the public eye
I bought myself a condo out in Queens
A plush white Volvo and drove off the scene
But I remained the same since I moved out
Then all of a sudden things started to change
And I never act prejudiced to none
But for some reason people make my lifestyle so critical
That's why they call me Mr. Pitiful
And the fifty dollar crew from Canada know what I mean
One for the ace and two for the deuce
Do the knowledge as I quote this
Five chapters and I still ain't been beat
Bout time I turned the microphone loose
Anyone after me is just an excuse
Even the level of the devil or Exorcist
Can't get next to this
Leave the metro scared and petrol
Cause Michael Jackson couldn't say it clearer
My only comp is the man in the mirror
As the Kane remains everlasting
With lyrics that's fast relief like aspirin
There ain't a way that you can touch or stand on me
So don't say hi to this Asiatic descendant
Put your weight on it
Allow me to introduce myself
As the Big Daddy Kane
A smooth lover from around the way
That's bound to drive any bitch insane
I was THROUGH with it before you learned what to do with it
I'm also known as the hot pussy seeker
Also it gets a little deeper
An old old lady came my way
So I pulled out my dick
It was so shiny it looked like it was painted
The hoe took one look and damn near fainted
I stuck it in the bitch and the bitch began to shout
I walked barefoot from New York to Dallas
Won for Pimp of the Year at the Caesar's Palace
Made a big snowstorm on the 4th of July
And drunk the waters in the Atlantic Ocean till that shit was dry
And I kicked Jack's ass and took his hoe Jill
I'm the one who broke the bull's back
And made people say FUCK McDonald's and call ME the Big Mac
Why you long lanky motherfucker
I was born in a barrel of butcher knives
I've been slapped by a bear and bit by an eel
I jumped in the ocean and swallowed a whale
Why you ignorant decrepit motherfucker
So bitches wouldn't have to go out and rob
I made the streets of New York hot as a SAUNA
And hung a Home Sweet Hoe sign on every corner
Why you insecure no business barn junkyard
You gotta cook me a chicken and a half a day
Walk from New York to Los Angeles and throw the bones away
You gotta be BORN BLIND and cannot see
Ride a bald eagle a million feet in the AIR
Attention to the whole crew
And Little Daddy since you my brother
Prepare yourself for MC terror
Rapper so smooth and swift with the gift of gab
Until both shoes are city
The regulator innovator dominator creator of data
Lyrics don't display a too don sweet
Make sure each and every lyric is harmless
Only MC with an original rap style
You never seen a dancer who rapped well you met one
Now spin the Wheel of Fortunes or be wise and stay back
Or get ate like oats and barley
Well god damn it's me y'all
... At a pretty young girl that walk by
Now back to the subject of the matter
For when trouble comes then I never have to meet it
I shake and bake or fake a snake
The Little Daddy Shane
You better believe there's no comp and I'm certain
So take it easy and slide on greasy
I'm more rougher than steak when it's raw
So keep it on and you don't quit
Then I put it to sleep
I see a lot of brothers got raisins in the place
And I ain't no bullshit bodyguard
Walk the streets to New York and stay alive
And sweet and deadly like a killer beehive
And I can stalk in Fort Greene park and survive...
And my name is Ant Live
Put your weight on it fellas
Anyway you can get back to work now
Get back to your god damn jobs
And since I got paid and blew up like a live grenade
And I'd just like to thank all of you
And this goes to everybody in the entire world
I just wanna dedicate this one to you
And I just want to say hello
Or should I say peace as I start to release
The poetry that don't cease is never the least
Your feet got to shuffle as I put the muscle in the groove
Once you experience a whole Kane rhyme
With lyrics that's bright as the morning sun
This is that particular beat
I wanna talk about peace and unity and love
Black and white to unite and oh man oh man
Right about now I wanna have a little fun with this
And just talk a little bit of junk ya know
So I'm gonna have a little fun with it
Four times for your mind the poetically inclined
Genuine and divine can still climb
When you thought that I wouldn't go the length
But I cup a cameo and I still got strength
To be blunt and lay my cards on the table
In comes the era of the chocolate types
Including myself in the cipher the Big Daddy Kane is a part of it
When it comes to the girls they know the program
So ladies grab a hand and join the caravan
Then don't miss a breath of my kiss of death
An A plus in lust while your boyfriend is a F
And separate the men from their women like Apartheid
But when I say Prince of Darkness I don't mean a blood sucker
So mysterious and serious the women are curious
And tonight's the night for me to get right
And give girls the feeling of love at first bite
So here's a lesson of what the don art is
Change the groove and funk it up a little bit
Now back to the subject of how the
Kane became the bigger modern day mama wild deep
Now the question is do I really carry it
Still a few of them thought that I was lame
So let me send a dark shadow right through ya
And yes my dear if you got the goods
Then you might just see my face up in your neck of the woods
Take it from the man that does it real smooth
Present yourself all proper is important if you truly do want her
Make her feel like the most
Wine and dine under candlelight
Make the mood right tonight while the stars are bright
Then hop in the hot tub and start to rub her on her back
Satisfaction guaranteed
We gotta give the woman what she need
So even if it's not your style
Open the door for them once in a while
Only makes things better in a relation
So try a little Tenderness like Otis Redding
Put the gangster approach on pause
Pick your definition and put it together
They know that it only takes Kane one verse
Just so I can go and flow and throw a blow
Should go ask Smokey Robinson for a Miracle
I wouldn't let a rapper go one round
And here's what I want y'all to say
Give a little shout to the rappers that's out
Who showed the power of a woman and me a believer
Now backtrack with the musical jewel
And say peace to the old school
I can't forget the brothers that's down in Miami
You're still 2 Live if you never get a Grammy
Cause personally I feel who really needs that stuff
Cause every Billy and Joey is another David Bowie
I guess I used the wrong tools in my rhymes
Becomes a friend of me
And here's what I want y'all to say
What we have here... is a collaboration
Of the Big Daddy Kane... and the Little Daddy Shane
It's a tune... a tune about unity...
And peace amongst each other
The Smooth Operator's in the place to be
The Little Daddy Shane for the world to see
Now I must admit that I'm a sensitive guy
But then again at times I may be a mean fellow
I wish people of the world could be like that
I guarantee you by time I'm through
You gotta give me more props than a Motown Revue
I can't hold back any longer
I can't prolong my feelings for you any more
You know all of a sudden I feel this certain need to...
... Express myself to you
You see before I felt kind of funny to say these kind of things
Well let's just say I'm not ashamed
Now in my lifetime I've been all around the world
And I believe that I've played every game in the world
Now I realize that love takes time
Well I'm prepared to give you all of me
These are some things that I've been meaning to say
And for my concealed feelings I've come to realize
So I have to take a little time out to get together
What sparks would start this flame
Don't ever feel ashamed
You know just yesterday I portrayed my life as a player
As ah... as just a one night affair
What sparks would start this flame
Don't ever feel ashamed
What sparks would start this flame
Ah just let yourself be free
Ah come on and talk to me
I know that you played every game...
We'll take it nice and slow yeah
What sparks would start this flame
Don't ever feel ashamed sugar
What sparks would start this flame
That itself makes a brother wanna break
And said that's where I gotta go
And the times are so hard to understand
That it makes me a troubled man
Love can be just too much for the mind
Married girls in tight miniskirts
I don't discriminate with girls that I talk to
But now I couldn't find the right girl to fit me
Not even if she walked into my face and bit me
You see it's hard to make a woman your wife
Brothers from the past...
I try to explain I'm not on tour yet
I gotta throw joints to prove my point
Just when I thought that I had the neighborhood support
You know they even tried to start a AIDS rumor
Didn't bring my sex flow to an end
And the beat goes on until the thrill is gone
And life is the same old song
And maybe one day you can understand
What it's like to be a troubled man
I come up upon the scene to romance thee
Make sure you never feel any rejection
Be a more better man prior to
Don't shed a tear never fear my dear I'll be there
When I'm in motion it's just like the flow of the ocean
The weight of the words swerve and curve
My style flexes bigger than the state of Texas
I guess that makes me the top of the line
Oh yes I'm the most prime of all time
To knowledge the God on the groove
Too much for one mind to comprehend
First saw Big Daddy at the place called Union Square
Bring your bats and balls and please don't forfeit
Not in this sport of thought we block out the devil
Gotta make a mega migraine
All the braids in my neck symbolizes that I want room
Flip before you move or catch a bad one baby
I'm about as bad as you can get
And I'm the wrong one to mess with
Just like the cooks at Sara Lee
But it still wouldn't save ya
And now my black ass is still here like Billy Joel
My broken English you can still distinguish
And I don't have no image or no gimmicks
And I don't have no bounds or no limits
I'm the predator to any competitor
And any MC that tries to test me
I turn into nightmares you have in the hospital
You're just a cheap little hooker and I gotta overlook a
And get your jury and a good defendant
It ain't hard to tell
I build and excel and plus I rap like hell
And rock the Gladys Knight to the next Morris Day
I get sexy like Marvin Gaye
So pay attention to how the Smooth Operator does it
Just acknowledge the sound
So I don't care if you step to me in three flocks
Then I apply pain just like a migraine
Nobody gets on after me
Class in session as I give the lesson
To prove to another rapper that I rule in his profession
I gotta pick up the pace and go
Remains from the Kane I drained the last brain
All the competition that's on the bandwagon
I take the groove around around around around around
Throw your hands in the air and pump your fists
The name of the jam is get down so let me see you do it
And show some unity in music
We gotta show our young ones the right way
To avoid crucial poison and the price they might pay
I just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease
When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt
To stage a rage is what rap did to me
And captivate the whole crowd's majority
The rhymes I use definitely amuse
I'm sure to score adored for more without a flaw
A strong song as long as you groove to this
I keep the crowd loud when you're hyped
So let's all sing the big daddy anthem
But my apparatus is up to status
Take a loss and be forced from the danger zone
I get ill and kill at will
Just stand still and chill as I build
The man at hand to rule and school to teach and reach
The blind to find their way from a to z
And be the most and boast the loudest rap
The suckers all scope and hope to cope but nope
But it still ain't loud enough
I go pound for pound and round for round to clown the sound
My comp should just drop out
Cause none of them can see me
A DJ gets no damn credit
I'm always in the background
And the first time a record skips
Now ain't that a bitch
I swear one of these days I'm gonna pull the power switch
And when it's time for the show
And you got the nerve and try to complain
Until you learn to show your DJ some respect
Now put your weight on that shit here
From a Sister Act down to a Single White Female
And to battle me you shouldn't even try
And I don't care if you bring a crew
And I don't even care if someone else writes for you
Man you could even be someone the crowd may just like but shoot
And Billboard for my five year duration
And see that I got more spots than a dalmatian
Let's get down to finish this large
Well you're god damn right you should
So act like you know Baby Pop
With the whole wolf pack in the place to be.
Better known as the chocolate city.
They know I'm wilder than a dog with hot sauce.
I set it off and get live like an alarm clock.
Over rough tracks I tax any midget with a small digit.
I put the crowd to to smashed like a driver that's intoxicated.
But wouldn't squeeze a lemon in a cocktail.
I'm untouchable to rappers my size.
Now you know you'd too like to be with it...
And put that rough talk on the shelf
You wouldn't steal first base at a baseball game
I mean for goodness sake
The only beef you ever had was a sirloin steak
You wanna question me and all the words I say
Why should I give up for gangster contrast
To prove that I'm a gangster only brings me trouble
That goes to show you that even when you're respected
To see who made the whole thing go down
Word on the streets had it
Some kids from the Bronx with automatics
Some new jacks at the game
It's a big payback when I retaliate
And I can't wait to set it off
To revenge my main man that's gone
It's time to show them how to get hard
So I took a little trip to Brooklyn
We rolled up to see what this joint's about
So without delay we reacted
I caught the kid by the corner store deli
Kicked him in the belly like I was Jeff Kelley
I did his jugular vein something violent
Came back to see my crew made the rest silent
We sent fifteen bodies to Trapper John
I sort of figured if you thought I was weak
You'd mop the street up with me
And I got to kill a lot more of your people
Many screamed about a homicide
I plead insanity when I got a jam with me
I bring the boys that'll bring the noise
Like a crew of barbarians
So don't even front and try to put it as if you're ruff
Have fallen and they can't get up
A lot of times I get fly with a suit and a tie
Yeah I went from rags to riches but I still rock the saggy britches
And I don't try to act brand new
The ghetto life I've seen a lot overcome
Make a little money and then forget where they came from
So take a seat in the rear
The way you see me knock out the next brother
Man I burn the next MC like gonorrhea
Then pull her friend by the name of maria
Well I got a little rap thing I wanna breeze through
When I grab the microphone and shout
And definitely the last MC to be present
Don't even try to take mines
Some good advice is just break out
For this somber occasion
It was a great microphone in it's day
Until it met it's fate
One evening while it was in the studio
It was struck by the lyrical force of the Big Daddy Kane
I murdered plenty rappers and believe that I'll murder more
So if you ask to give the Kane a go
You couldn't be a King if you played hockey in Los Angeles
That I have never knew love like this before
And I adore everything about you
I do mean every part of
I wanna kiss ya father
You're the kinda girl I wanna get closer to
Become the most to you like love is supposed to do
And since they say love is blind
I'm the Ray Charles of rap
And I'm waiting for you to put me in your mix
All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I looked for you
And today my dreams come true
You need me and I need you
Love in us is very special
You look straight into my eyes
Love is life and life is living very special
Well I must admit that you know how to treat a woman
And our relationship won't ever get dull
Because you're always on my mind even more than my own skull
And I can't wait for your enticing delivery
Staying together is a must
Neither one of us needs another lover
And just so it can stay that way
I talk the macho talk and keep my real feelings hidden
Well I hope you meant that mushy stuff you told Barry White
Because I think I know you well enough to be understood
Well since you put it like that Daddy then we can do this
I wanna give ya my love
I wanna give ya my love
I operate around the clock like city bus
Ruff rhymes that rag any rap herb
Built by the best to bust swerves like a sharp curve
And bring the hype type of freestyle rhyme for the crowd to sing
By any chance that I do get burnt
And I can get funky like a high school locker room
I rock songs to make your grandmother dance
My rhymes are more together than a girl in biker pants
I never sweat the girls when it comes to a phone call
I got things sewn up tighter than a football
Brooklyn's in the house and ain't a damn thing new
Here comes the Prince of Darkness ready to spark this
And show the people just who is the hardest
Rebel for wreck them rappers I dissect them
So rappers take flight like they work for Delta
For sure endure to injure him or her
So all my competition gets destroyed
You need to put your weak rhymes on steroid
For you to ever to press up on the mightiest man
Many many many new jacks got it in they head
That they can raise up on this and put the Kane in fright
Your rhymes can't get you out of
Some good advice is don't even come out my way
One of the best to ever be and
No other can ever take a stand
When I kick a verse the scene becomes so scary
I got a death blow whenever I throw
With double impact to take out the whole row
Here's a little message for your own concern
You try to press up on this and get burned
Here comes the new modern day Dark Gable
And if your girl says she met me... I probably did her
Ready for action if you wanna see why
I shove deeper than the voice of Barry
To put you in more positions than a Jane Fonda workout
I'm ready to tear down walls
So witness the glare when I appear
And no one friar comes higher than the messiah
So take your hand and fold cause this is total control
Check my Modus Operandi
Those who know my name know I ain't about games
So when I come in the same place as my enemy
I won't say what you are but I'll hit you
You're found on a woman and a penis goes in you
My vocabulary is very
To support what they thought would've brought them
You better never act new
Come on y'all and feel the groove
Get on down and make your move
Welcome to the funkiest
Where the peeps smoke blunts and like to wear mad gold caps
The party addict about to explode
And for those who just don't know how it go
Play like a substitute teacher and ACT like you know
You and your whole entourage couldn't test me
And front with what you got
You're gonna be looked at as a black man still so keep it real
I'm really happy to see you blew up
But always remember my man you grew up
Skilled at trades at hand with those who made
The man with support and always stayed a fan
My dialectic style is perfected
Knocked out his fronts cause the kid was mad fragile
Where I'm from there's no need for hesitation
Who you know and where you're from I pull your file
All the projects on the east coast
Like that good times show it makes me go
And just because I moved out the residence
It don't mean that I can't represent
Let me know you're out there
Let me know you're out there
And let me know you're out there
And let me know you're out there
And see if you can get ten dollars from my moms
Tell her to throw it out the window if she got it to spare
To make the coldness last
And meet us in the back park to get sparked
So I can be toasted by time it gets dark
Peace and harmony is what I relate to
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we in there
From all thugs that flex with all the muscle
Where people get beat quick
The sweetest game I ever seen
All you gotta do is find the red queen
I play by the point of the finger of the hand
And put some real lyrics back in the hardcore
Is like Freddy with the glove full of knives
You ain't never paid dues
I'm glad in this business I didn't forget who I am
I always remain the Kane inside a battle
And with my competition I let it be known
That's the way the flavor always come
You want the funk so let me give you some
The Smooth Operator is mellow with the saxophone
The girls treat me like the drummer and give me some
And none of you players can control me
You get the chance to see a true mack man
Taller than anybody else's stacks it seem
Cause the Kane get more paper than a fax machine
Keep rappers in order more than letters put alphabetical
And I hope the record consumers don't believe the magazine rumors
Y'all just sit there and listen
So I had to silence the lamb and show him who I am
So I just set it off on my competitor
So I can school that ass just like Joe Clark
And made it complicated for him to illustrate it
That was enough to slow his whole train of thought down
Drive down 125th with my man
A bunch of bootleg tapes that he had claim on it
So I snatched everything with my name on it
But now you tried to take money out of my pocket
Now it's time to move him off the block
And I'll break down sixteen shots
To have another come along and take my dough
Throw the tapes in the Lexus
And watch the bombs I drop just rock your knot
Cause it ain't wise to address me
I wouldn't advise a schoolteacher to test me
Cause you never seen this type of lyrical genius
The definition of sex varies with many people
In search of a few ways to define it
And his response was...
Then we asked rap star Big Daddy Kane his definition of sex
Now it's time for me to lick that body
The nipples on your breasts just like a pacifier
And let me see what I can do with those 34 C's
I plan to lick your bellybutton my dear
And let my tongue walk five steps downstairs
The way that I plan to put this chocolate syrup to use
And now you're under my spell like a magician
I'm not the Ku Klux Klan but I stay under sheets
I make you feel the reel to reel you feel
Then bend over doggy style and just watch me
Then I'm the one that gets the job done
Straight like that...
This is how we gonna get it off baby
Some people call me Kane some people call me Big Daddy
I walk through the streets of New York everyday
I hang with rappers like Doug E. Fresh and Cool J
The B to the I to the like to the G
As I keep it strong I won't steer you wrong
Like you put your armpits in a drum machine
Break me off some of that
The one who created it and many others imitated it
He makes the party swing
He turns the mother out
And rips apart things
You know I like the way it sound
No need to grief or mourn cause now the beef is on
I only know one person that can come next to me
You know I like the way it sound
Because if in my wallet I can find one prophylactic
Hard type of rappers extinct like a dinosaur
The kind you saw rhyme before
But now you never find no more
Just put the beat on and watch how I swing through
To turn it out without a doubt and show what I'm about
Now I'm a family man that works hard for the money
Even her nails and her hair to be done at the beauty parlor
And whatever else sounds groovy
We walk around in our pajamas in the Bahamas
I love her and I need her and I never ever cheat her
I thought that she was in love with me
I used to think that she couldn't get enough of me
Why we can't find a little piece of mankind
Cause someone else got the clock rocked
Don't even front and try to ask who is this
Cause my name rings more bells than a Jehovah Witness
But not even Johnny Mathis can tell you what your chances are
Because when I start to flow the results are so deadly
The only way you could fuck with me is in a orgy
We got the milk and honey
I get my point across because the boss is truly yours
In other words it's hazardous to your health
So don't do it to yourself
Don't make me put my timberland boot to your grill piece
To think that you could touch me
Or even try to come above me
So anything else you heard is irrelevant
So spare yourself the misfortune and proceed with caution
I crush those who oppose with blows to your nose
So before you step to me use your head
And you better think about it more than special ed
See the crowd in an uproar acting unstable
Here comes dark gable raps remarkable
If I'm not the best then I'm a damn striking resemblance
I roll the dice on the streets that be cold as ice
And cause great disturbance just like a poltergeist
I come attacking this enrage to disengage the missing page
To the newest in age that's hitting stage
For I be one that knows the art
Tell me how much can you take from me the man to make
Rhymes that's so butter my breath smell like land o lakes
Beware of one of the best they be
You wanna test the God I hope you mean a sat
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo hands up to the sky
I spit a few to listen to when this I do it's as if as you
Was invisible it'll make your life miserable
I be that wrong one to get fly on
I heat it up to where I pasteurize half the guys
A fast demise disaster lies as he dies
Confront one of the best at rhyming
What I write it be so rough that my ink pen need alignment
I remember how I formed it up
Turned the fire down to simmer as I calmed it up
Cause you couldn't bring it to me if you worked for fed ex
I come cutting through split his gut in two
About to give you more of the raw
Get on down baby we keep it live
You talk about your ride and you don't even got one
Desire and admire it entire
Approach them all with some bad intentions
Rappers like Craig Mack quench my thirst for comedy
Even the NBA make rap dollars
Talent's around the world Phoenix to Providence
No need to educate Chicago they already got Common Sense
Houston and Atlanta we love you
We always say the future's in today's children
Brothers need to unify to keep the game alive
Rappers be coming out with one album then they gone
Then brothers like Smooth wouldn't have to hustle
What we specialize in
The fame in the rap game we all want it
Depending on just having catchy hooks and beats
Rappers using their skills recently I haven't heard of none
I used to listen to his music back in 1988
Lord I skill it in a way to make you feel it
Can bring that old schooler back just like alumni
Who gonna be the next clown to come step into my bounds
And let the more experienced entertain
I bag more dimes than workers at the herb gate
In the kingdom I hit it like lottery
And now you're in the zone
And I'm sure when you play on
That the way you put it down
Is gonna change this game around
I come around and get it like hot peas and butter
Give it to you good upon the mattress
No theatrics when the Kane approach
Put you in more positions than a football coach
It's all love in here baby now sock it to me.
I don't discriminate they come upon ease
In case I wanna taste that
Just can't control my hormones and
So I can put my man in
Don't you know it ain't what you got y'all it's how you use it
Laying it out with swift vocabulary
My purpose is making sure you bless me right
Daddy love how I get down ain't no secret
Easy pickings on the chickens got them up in the camp
I see the honeys in the frontier looking for what you want dear
And ain't a damn thing changed
We get together and we do our thing
On stage at arenas or a show in the park
I shine so bright my black ass glow in the dark
Lyrical apocalypse all through your metropolis
Sexual chocolate the velvet smooth voice
That be the people's choice and get the girls moist
Got the world in my hands you ain't even found the hemisphere
Now get this it's time we start stepping to our business
I come as living proof so bear witness
Not to contradict myself but see really
I'm untouchable but making sure you people feel me
I talk that talk from the gutter my game don't stutter
I can tell you why white milk be making yellow butter
I flow over tracks when the beats are mean
Girls I go downtown when the streets are clean
Make it happen all my peoples
So I return to give you more again
Because my name dates back until the game's origin
Times was simply plain I knew they'd eventually change
Let's take a trip down memory lane
When you was funky fresh or down by law
Parlay with your crew at the corner store
Carrying a boom box till your arms were sore
Lying bout skins that we didn't get
Slow moving at paces through the rat races
Making moves any type of way
That's how it was before
When you was funky fresh or down by law
Way back in the days how we used to do
Thank you for the good times y'all
Shorties make me think how we used to do
Came to school wearing puma's went home barefooted
And on the weekends when everybody click
To slide to the deuce to check karate flicks
Come back around the way after dark
So the crew could embark on the jam in the park
Only way to break it up was playing rappers delight
And as I sit back watching you
Shorties out there doing what you got to do
I feel for you being sincere
Ain't nothing but love I got to give
That negative lifestyle I prohibit
Now I'll admit that I sort of be flashing
But yet and still I do it in an orderly fashion
Just when the game got the stakes set high
A new wold order's in effect
I send this out to the shorties in the hood
Then I commit to hit you with this composite that's ultimate
But child what I'll compile is too versatile
Spanking new desert eagle to a rusty little derringer
And no you don't have to know how to paint to make your rhymes a form of art
Poetry and literature is what makes this English fanatic
And since I don't be dealing with what's considered a mystery
I learned the dead presidents to pass American history
I put it on them using my tongue as a sword
But at times get broader than broad for those who insist to get floored
My name should be referred to in medical terms
That's when the rappers go get the clappers
It's time to teach the youth get it together show and prove
Me no run with the gun or speak of none for action
I deal with equality so never call my brethren son
I'm the Kane so you know the outcome
Hip hop to me Re boxing to Roy Jones Jr.
That on the microphone I can handle mine
Here's a view to a kill as I flipped the skill
I come equipped to fight and if I flip tonight
Water flows that be hard to distinguish
Stepping to me is a lot of risk. I release skills that's abundant
To explode and drop on you like flight 800
Keep it moving world renown
That we can hold it down
Here's a percentage of that old vintage
Macaroni flow but its mare than an image
Swift maneuvering to crush the crew you bring
Last thing them want tell me is Kane go do your thing who the king
Asiatic non equivalent to any
Plus I play the game a more harder way than Penny
The plan that I mobilize for dough to rise is no surprise
That it comes from what I vocalize
I'm the best you can get as I hit you with
The stroke of death And I ain't even broke a sweat
But this is where I draw the. line you're sure to find
Lyrics I be dropping is too much for the mortal mind
The hip hop laws should be reinforced
You thought that you could hold me down no you're not
But instead you don't want the love to spread
So daddy says nothing he keeps his cool
I been through your tribulations and conflicts
Anything possible to keep me out the mix
Where my rivalries lack I'm still nice with these Black
I rap with the safety cap so that you don't get it twisted
And be another statistic
To get the papers to me is a necessity
And I don't want a piece of the pie I want the recipe
I can't lose with what I use
I'm the reason why the lady sings the blues
While she's walking in her father's footsteps
Or could it be the president that's being hesitant
And I ain't kidding you when I say it's political
The way they make a ridicule of artists can be pitiful
You know damn well there shouldn't be no company CO
Trying to show me about rap that's 53 or so
When they should be working records for Gladys Knight
Cause you getting less points than Steve Kerr be getting in a game
And just because it be too hardcore to judge it
Cause everybody I know got beat their first album
But cross be in their heart like a vampire stabbed with a crucifix
I had the enemy in my vicinity with the false identity
Of a friend to me to injure me
They ride along just to guide you wrong
I can see your skin peeling it changed like a chameleon
I start to think back when I was just a youth
I should have listened to the words of the God Born Truth
But yet and still you want to mimic the stars of cinema
You know that it's impossible to stop the unstoppable
And I grab the microphone and flip it like pizza dough
Only time I hit a 3 be on the basketball court
Ladies and Gentlemen it's the world renown
Put your hands up high if you testify
Thank you love that's right keep it real for me
As I run it down to you all skillfully
Because it ain't hard to tell who's the liver one
Some of y'all just ain't got your game in order
You don't want to tangle
Who you came out to see in the place to be
I seen somebody trying to get him with sunlight
Ooh it's starting to get ugly
As I tongue the microphone down just like a French kiss.
Put it on you like voodoo
Possessed with the Brooklyn techniques we freak
Even if you escape just tell me who can you run to
And reach your cerebral cause that's how we do
Rip your whole set to shreds
I'm suffering a bad case of lyrical congestion
Come mess with and end up with your chest split
I'm recognized as the microphone destroyer
Competition minds in the state of paranoia
You won't win with it so limit it
Before I make your body start to hemorrhage
Just when you thought that you was burning me
You found yourself bleeding internally
See the crowd in an uproar acting unstable
Here comes Dark Gable raps remarkable
If I'm not the best then I'm a damn striking resemblance
I roll the dice on the streets that be cold as ice
And cause great disturbance just like a poltergeist
I come attacking this enrage to disengage the missing page
To the newest in age that's hitting stage
For I be one that knows the art
Tell me how much can you take from me the man to make
Rhymes that's so butter my breath smell like land o lakes
Beware of one of the best they be
You wanna test the God I hope you mean a SAT
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo hands up to the sky
I spit a few to listen to when this I do it's as if as you
Was invisible it'll make your life miserable
I be that wrong one to get fly on
I heat it up to where I pasteurize half the guys
A fast demise disaster lies as he dies
Confront one of the best at rhyming
What I write it be so rough that my ink pen need alignment
I remember how I formed it up
Turned the fire down to simmer as I calmed it up
But take a look I think the Kane about to overcook
Cause you couldn't bring it to me if you worked for Fed Ex
I come cutting through split his gut in two
About to give you more of the raw
Get on down baby we keep it live
You talk about your ride and you don't even got one
Desire and admire it entire
Approach them all with some bad intentions
I relieve rappers just like Tylenol
When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt
The Sage of Rage is what rap did to me
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem
And captivate the whole crowd's majority
The rhymes I use definitely amuse
Better than Dynasty or Hill Street Blues
I work like a slave to become a master
The minute that the Kane starts to go on
Believe it's gonna be smooth sailing so sail on
As I put other rappers out of their misery
The meaning of RAW is Ready And Willing
And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd
I rip the microphone and leave it scarred
So if we battle on the microphone
Bring your own casket and tombstone
Rock the discotheques and this groove is what's next
I keep the crowd loud when you're hype
So let's all sing the Big Daddy anthem
But my apparatus is up to status
Save the bass for the pipe and rearrange your tone
Or take a loss and be forced in the danger zone
So just stand still and chill as I build
Science I drill until my rhymes fill
Your head up... don't even get up
You ever had to confront me and you can bet that
Stand in command with the clan
Without further ado or any delay
As the microphone lord proceeds to get raw
And if you still want some... set if off
For you to cope is just a wish and a hope
The lyrics I bring them keeps the crowd hyper
As I release the masterpiece
And drop some smooth lyrics
And ain't no half stepping
Rappers stepping to me they want to get some
They can't get with me
I'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
Competition I just devour
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
Ready to die because you're petty
My rhymes are so dope and
The rappers be hoping
Then again on second thought
It's quite confusing for you to remember
The best oh yes I guess suggest the rest should fess
Don't mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraph I manifest
Have a break from a take of me acting ill
Next the formation of words that fit
And devour with the power of Hercules
Cause you could scalp my cameo and I'll still have strength
Be sleeping on your rhymes till I start to snore
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare
So on to be want to be competition
The creator conductor of poetry
I speak clearly so you can understand
Because I always speak with mentality
I'll just break him and bake him and rake him
And take him and mold him and make him
Hold up the peace sign...
Get wise to the exercise
Listen to the rap allow it to trap
Your body and soul so that you can adapt
To the man on display as I take you away
Proud to be a Black man
Giving up to brothers five on the back hand
Pray for lease and peace upon each other
With my sisters and brothers
Tackled and shackled our ancestors
Country that we all came from
Because the moral of it all is we shall overcome
The cream will keep rising
Building and building to carry on
All the way from Malcolm X to Farrakhan
Those who fell victim were those without scruples
So hold up the peace sign and stand together
Take heed to the words that I manifest
Take a stand the fight for power
Living superior abiding by nature
The history of the Asiatic one paid the
Price to be paid in slavery
Like the name of Antonio was gave to me
But knowledge of self broke every shackle and chain
Now I declare myself as the Big Daddy Kane
So discover the truth of one another
But the color of black is most dominant
The rising and sizing can never cease
The one they call the Big Daddy Kane is here
To deliver a message to everyone everywhere
So listen up party people cause this you should hear
That you will find very rare and far beyond compare
All is sincere and rather debonair
Off to a place you thought was unreal
Where people of the world do know how to chill
Everything remains cool and calm where you are
They wouldn't even know what you mean
Where people work hard for a decent buck
And you can wear truck jewelry without being stuck
Never wondering whether your house is all right
So go leave your VCR on the porch overnight
And as for the people they all stand proud
You can hang at a jam till the break of dawn
Everyone walks around in their right mind and all
Because crack ain't nothing but a hole in the wall
So those who wish to live with glare and flair
What I discovered may just only seem
As something that you find in your wildest dream
There is a place people live with joy
That the next man cannot come along and destroy
And war ain't nothing but a game on Atari
This message also applies to other nations
Ethiopians can eat in Red Lobster for free
And people that you saw before that were poor
Will never ever see the situation no more
Cause in this world everyone's a millionaire
Fashions are smashing for all to flaunt
And we can get anything that we want
So don't think you can't afford expensive design
So come ye all and attend this affair
Since I'm the type of guy that laughs and jokes
It's a shame that people today must live
In a world that's operating oh so negative
But I found a place designed especially for you
Where peace and harmony is everyone's culture
So let's all gather around before this world corrupts
We came here to just motherfucking do
Got my man Marley Marl in the house
Juice Crew in the house
We gonna do a little something like this I say...
Tour from New York to South Dakota
Drink ginger ale or root beer soda
Never get the girls with the underarm order
Once knew a girl by the name of Rhoda
I watch Star Wars just to see Yoda
Maybe Commando or the Terminator
To me getting paid and getting busy fall together
That I be using and not many can manage
Giving party people something funky to listen to
I stomp them out just like I was King Kong
I go on and on and on and
Until the bright Shirley Murdock morning
Never use a barbershop I got my homeboy Smooth
Cooling out with the clippers right around the way
To keep my fresh Cameo cut every day
The verdict that I reach for you is rather blurry
But my rhymes will remain like a hieroglyphic
Here comes the conquering brother that fathoms and never ceases.
That are left behind as you're left to find
They rap a brief moment and then shut up.
Lips are sealed because all of this is real.
And all the product you sell is real dangerous
These are the games that a fool would play today
For our own kind to decay.
Just scavengers in search of...
They can't understand to see a black man
And then they assume that I'm a drug dealer.
Then come get this when you're ready for business
Because they can't drop rhymes like these.
So pay attention as I mention the 411.
They all be afraid they won't get paid
The righteous with a walk in success and be strong.
A brother like the Big Daddy Kane is peace with
I thrash bash clash mash and ten more
And reach the blind to find their way from A to Z
Level of def one step beyond dope
You suckers all scope and hope to cope but NOPE
But it still ain't loud enough
Peace in the name of I Self Lord and Master
I come to teach and preach and reach and each
Drop science and build with math
Too many rappers have fronted to get a name out
Your rhymes are more false than dentures
Rhyme or find the time to design a line
I get busy from sun to sun
And just throw your hands in the air
I take the cake but you can't get a crumb
I profile a style that's mild and meanwhile
Put on trial a rap pile to exile
And I'm still calm and humble
And if may make this one thing here clear
And I can slice and dice a fisher price MC
That thought he was nice into minute rice
As I design the genuine line
Take two other men with soul that you probably know
The unique technique I speak is all original
You like to sag and drag and gag
Competition may find it spectacular
And this is one thing to us we ain't new to
I'm the man you can't hold back
And all competition appears to be weak
As I give a shout out to my man tony a
Flow and go to a slow tempo and you know
But I'm not animated like a cartoon
So out of the MERCY of Allah
For what I'm about to say
To obey okay so let the man build
Words of rapture that you have to capture
And I just slapped ya
With the hand full of literature
That's dope def fresh hype choice smooth and raw
Competition you must be on freebase
You're still cold off the road for the role you stole
Those who dispute get treated just like a prostitute
They get the boot and played like a flute
Because you're petty confetti and not ready to rock steady
But when it come to hype rhymes I got one
Just like the album is still the same
I still get ill and kill at will and build the skill
To fill your grill so don't tell me you're real
You'd be another memory to us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
It's a benefit for you and me
The chosen one that has turned a new leaf
With the knack to attract the pack
And just go with the flow you know
In the place to be with my man Marley Marl
Can't forget my main man Heavy D
And they've gotten a hold on me
Now it's time to see what we can do to solve them
New rule be enforced in school so we can get rid of
All the bad apples in the bunch
Clean up the wall and cook better lunch
Put the students in class where they should be
The job is yours to play the boss enforce the laws
It's up to do so what you gonna do
To resurrect and perfect the entire school around
Our learning ability is increased quadrupled
And we're off to a brand new start
I played my part to prove that you're smart
So take heed to this as a blessing and remember...
So let knowledge uproot ya
A natural born lover with love to give free to ya
I'm just a smooth operator that gets the job done
Cause ever since I was young I could keep girls sprung
Just by the movement of my tongue
I remember it all started way back
And now it's 1990 and you can find me as I dunk
Because the ladies is all I dream of
And not even Anita Baker can give sweeter love
This is a world premier and I'm here
A presentation beyond compare
That means dance as I get smooth with
Poetic perfection that you can groove with
Word to be heard never blurred or slurred
I'm not the type of MC to be merciful
So if your name ain't Jermaine take it personal
Cause like a vigilante I'm gonna kill off any
Sucker MC that tries to withstand me
The verbal law for the Nation of Islam
Wisdom I speak makes your head nod
But many doubt my Knowledge of Self
And that's the reason I don't swine
This is the proper way man should use ink
But you're at your brink and your rhymes are extinct
Before you're put in the Dead Poet's Society
That's how I build and destroy
With a groove so smooth you can't help but get into
My vocabulary will just have you very
That means competition
Total destruction as I rip up the damn stage
The mood for the Smooth Operator to start this flow
I crushed and crushed and stomped the comp that tried
Only one survivor can remain
That I have never knew love like this before
And I adore everything about you
I do mean every part of
I wanna kiss ya father
You're the kinda girl I wanna get closer to
Become the most to you like love is supposed to do
And since they say love is blind
I'm the Ray Charles of rap
And I'm waiting for you to put me in your mix
All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I looked for you
And today my dreams come true
You need me and I need you
Love in us is very special
You look straight into my eyes
Love is life and life is living very special
Well I must admit that you know how to treat a woman
And our relationship won't ever get dull
Because you're always on my mind even more than my own skull
And I can't wait for your enticing delivery
Staying together is a must
Neither one of us needs another lover
And just so it can stay that way
I talk the macho talk and keep my real feelings hidden
Well I hope you meant that mushy stuff you told Barry White
Because I think I know you well enough to be understood
Well since you put it like that Daddy then we can do this
I wanna give ya my love
I wanna give ya my love
To the whole rap world rhythm nation
And take a taste of this verbal vibration
With more color than you see on animation
And bear witness to my smooth operation
As I give the party people a sensation
And give them all a good feel of jubilation
To rock the house without any complication
That just gives me even more motivation
To pick up the pace and give you more fascination
They show the power of the Kane's innovation
And create an extravagant inspiration
And take time out for a dedication
To all the deejays and radio stations
Who put my record in heavy rotation
Reprise reps for their affiliation
Of course Warner Brothers help my elevation
For publicity to artist relation
And Carol Lewis for the tour preparation
And Farrakhan for the righteous conversations
I can't forget the people all around the nation
From the adults to the younger generation
Because the music ain't about segregation
It's a harmony to bring communication
So listen up as I give a demonstration
For you to get a much better illustration
Because their style is just a cheap imitation
It seems you need a little bit of dictation
Is supply a process of elimination
Serve justice by means of termination
Because a biter only brings aggravation
So here's a little bit of useful information
So that you can see some acceleration
It's gonna take hard work and concentration
That's the way that you blow up like inflation
And then maybe YOU can give a demonstration
So can I give a demonstration
For the sick people with constipation
You need to take a little bit of medication
Heal yourself you got to heal yourself
Mama said don't do crack and smoke you know
Since I was only 15 I had to listen
I went to school and saw all my friends do it
I started smoking to prove I'm an adult
I wished my mother would have told me the truth
Oh man I like the way that's going down
Everybody rise as I present to a jet black crowd
What it's like to be black and proud
In a world where white is right but not tonight
This is a black man's might
I heard a sister say she don't like darker shades of black
But to my light skin sister can't you tell
You're just the surface of a dark deep well
And how can you prefer to be wit those
That sprayed you wit gun and hoses
And never put roses on the graves
Of the slaves that they treated like dirt
After all that hard work
One of the biggest lies you hear from no one else
Is when a girl tries to say she don't do it to herself
Always fantasizing but steadily denying
She do it on the phone all alone wit a smile
Like me and any other kid who cared about books
But then I got wise and I begin to listen
And there is where I learned black history
And how to be the best that I can be
I went back and now the school is closed
There is nowhere for black youth to go
To be taught by brothers and sisters who knows what it means
To be a black child or a white teen
In the end the youth is being mistreated
Which means the world is being cheated
Dane was never taught her life was worth something
But when people don't try to improve it makes me want to hurt something
You want to be somebody and be a standout
Why is sister's giving up the ball
Today it seems not to father you too hard
They call us squeezers and you prove it to the worst
You have to earn the right to say it's ladies first
Oh man this is human education against lies
You better know the flavor kid
Human education against lies tries
To open the eyes of humanity before it dies
Black and white ain't the real fight
That's the only thing the media hypes
The real fight are these major corporations
Holding back on real education
Teaching humanity is what we're doing
And just when you thought you knew everything there was to know
Daddy's home everyday since he lost his job
His new line of work is now beating up mom
Her beautiful skin is now black and blue
A human war between women and men
Human education against lies
To all the girls and to all the guys
To each and every member of the opposite sexes
We never knew where the poison came from
Human education against lies
And when you sweat you're gonna get wet
I must admit it was well fitted
A piece of the pie would be fly
I wanna take a grand stand and
To get paid in this trade
And I believe that I can achieve
To make ends meet like a hair weave
And only money love can make it in the middle
I can't let life get the best of me
Control what I hold and of course be the boss of myself
No one else will bring my wealth
I gotta hit them streets to make ends meet
So just bust the style of a hustler
And a job ain't nothing but work
You get your's and I'll get mine
I won't stop at any cause
I won't stop till I'm the boss
None of the Beverly Hills or Flushing Meadows
Ain't no shame in my game
And I came through like a double bread
But still there's more here
That where my pockets will be the fattest
I'm not gonna be employed when times are hard
I'd rather do my own thing
I gotta be the one in charge
To make myself live large
Sex when I flex I catch wreck on the world tour
They wouldn't pick you even if you had a afro
I'll do you like the first part in menace ii society
I'll shoot a hole in your toe
I'll make you jump like the house of pain
We gonna do it like this
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC hammer and them 357 bitches
That's how I got the weed spot
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
We gonna do this shit like this
In a high speed chase with the law
The realest motherfucker that you ever saw
I walk the streets at night with my head down
And when shit rocks all you can hear when the shells drop
And this happens everyday around my way
So I pray that I can live another day
And let's just get one more thing understood
It's strictly business baby
The name is Big Daddy you know as in your father
You read the book of Mack and now it's time to meet the author
Get the bite words to follow like dice berg and babble
I follow the rules of engagement
That I learned from the school in the basement
When I move on the pavement
Vigorous pain that you about to feel shortly
Get more bucks than Milwaukee keep it real for me
I know the vision and the spot in the light
All you haters in the game you get blocked of the light
All starts in New York
I smash the bust of on they crest like Bill Clinton
We don't even speak to say kinda language
I slide with instead every night a different head
Get her hot with the spot like it forbid
And get more brain than Zombies in the Living Dead
Listen child lock your fists and cow
Trying to make them understand the realness in this here game man you know
This how serious it is on these streets
Your food stamps feed the next cat Turkey and Cheese
The only thing that's missing is the shackle's
Freak the future far from here and now
And make you want to crash the spot
And foretold to scores of six years ago
Lungs collapse and raps be trapped in
In star poetic inserts and yes y'all s
The outreach that rock police
The fly Casanova with the frankincense odor
Leave scattered remains of matter and stains
That'll explain how you was battled and slain
Of fans to boo and throw you off till you lose your flow
Put your whole team on pause like cold cream
Go after her weave from the breeze when I blow past ya
I'm dapper plus ghetto and just pedal
When the dust settles we left in the rubble the crushed metal
And homicides when I collide I get kamikaze
Son you out your league like Jordan was with baseball
Provoke the right to reverse to seek mercy
With the king Asiatic and Percy P
Spit venom and burn your body like a std
I mess around a lick cause you done cheat on my theme song
My verbal affirmation is to always go off
We got Big Daddy Kane over there
We all gonna do just one part
What all the racial war for
I walk through a color blind corridor
So let's form a rainbow over the mountain
And let's drink from the same water fountain
Let's make our Earth Day a story of
People that walk through the same territories
Then I see your family tree was uprooted
So don't be foolish if you're Jewish or Hindu
The racial manual is the evil that men do
I was raised in a nation of Asian
Hate shouldn't separate Jamaican from Haitian
I bring a rattle to a battle that you see me in
My nationality's reality
And yo a prejudiced man is of a devil mentality
Take a taste and erase the racism
Together we learn how to read and write
We got Big Daddy Kane over there
We all gonna do just one part
What all the racial war for
I walk through a color blind corridor
So let's form a rainbow over the mountain
And let's drink from the same water fountain
Let's make our Earth Day a story of
People that walk through the same territories
Then I see your family tree was uprooted
So don't be foolish if you're Jewish or Hindu
The racial manual is the evil that men do
I was raised in a nation of Asian
Hate shouldn't separate Jamaican from Haitian
I bring a rattle to a battle that you see me in
My nationality's reality
And yo a prejudiced man is of a devil mentality
Take a taste and erase the racism
Together we learn how to read and write
In the days of slavery
Some got to run away and many got done away
Inferiority is what some men say
Then again in the streets of New York
We got to better this world of prejudice
You better believe that I'm an Asiatic descendant
And I know what's been amended and intended
I know there's different strokes for different folks
But I've also acknowledged what hatred provokes
So don't hate me or try to underrate me
And we can all live together in harmony
If I'm a slave I'm a slave to the rhythm
To the black and the white
The red and the yellow
To all the nationalities
I'd like to say hello
In the days of slavery
Some got to run away and many got done away
Inferiority is what some men say
Then again in the streets of New York
We got to better this world of prejudice
You better believe that I'm an Asiatic descendant
And I know what's been amended and intended
I know there's different strokes for different folks
But I've also acknowledged what hatred provokes
So don't hate me or try to underrate me
And we can all live together in harmony
If I'm a slave I'm a slave to the rhythm
To the black and the white
The red and the yellow
To all the nationalities
I'd like to say hello
The last time I caught a body it was recent
He thought them bullet hit me but him didn't get none
Inside the morgue another body freezes
So yeah motherfucker come get a taste
A one man gang to bring the bang
I'm never to let a brother bass
And I got apartments to give
You get a slug in your mug
So fuck all the bullshit
So witness the glare when I appear
And no one friar comes higher than the messiah
So take your hand and fold cause this is total control
Check my Modus Operandi
Those who know my name know I ain't about games
So when I come in the same place as my enemy
I won't say what you are but I'll hit you
You're found on a woman and a penis goes in you
My vocabulary is very
To support what they thought would've brought them
You better never act new
I burn while the tables turn like windmills
With lyrics that came from the brain of Mark Twain
So if you can't handle the man please go and change the channel
People run inside the cellars
As I teach you're attached to my rhyme like a leash
Take the P off the peach because now you want each
And every rhyme to teach and reach
Some got shook when they took a look
You get defeated decapitated captivated
Sonny you're funny like Johnny Carson
These rhymes here can kill son
Too dope of a type windpipe full of hype
And I sideswipe the suckers I snipe
Chumps are caught in the blaze and dumped in ashtrays
Plus your name's unlisted
Your brainstorms don't even drizzle
You get sunken when I hit a punk and
Every time I think about you
My senses start to raise
And when I try to get you
You're gone without a trace
I see you here with me
But I've got to fight
Been watching everything you do
I can look but I can't touch
I try to get to know you
You're always in the distance
Don't seem to notice me
So much I want to tell you
Every time I try to stop you
But I've got to fight
Been watching everything you do
I can look but I can't touch
Been watching everything you do
I can look but I can't touch
All the same when I run my game
Let me make it crystal clear to you
Been watching everything you do
I can look but I can't touch
Been watching everything you do
I can look but I can't touch
In wanting you babe all night long
I can look but I can't touch
Have you ever met somebody that will love you like I do
And have you ever loved somebody that would give it all for you
I've always been by myself
Never cared for solitude
Just cared for the wealth
I was going crazy for you
And I ain't felt this way in a minute
And I ain't gonna lie to you ma
This shit I'm starting to dig it for real
Everything about you is what I like about you
I go crazy and I lose my mind
Trade my world and I'd give my life
And every day you make it clear that you don't want to be replaced
Five years done past and we done went through some drama
From court dates to miscarriages to you losing your mama
That you're my one and only
Baby oh I'm going crazy
It's like I toss and turn at night
Memories ease my pain
Then my eyes open wide
And I see you ain't there
Then the joy from the music turn to a permanent tear of ink
My only sanity in these walls
Is just the thought of you
Paradise up in my mind
Just for a second or two
Because I changed my ways ma
I can't keep my eyes off you
So hypnotized by the way you move
And I just wanna know
Baby what's your name
Let me slide a little closer when my time is right
Soon as ya done I'm up on ya
I can't keep my eyes off you
So hypnotized by the way you move
And I just wanna know
Baby what's your name
What it's gonna take to
What's it gonna take yeah...
Tell me what I gotta do
I'm sure ya hear it all the time
If I said it then I meant it
Not to try to get between ya
To make you a believer
Like these champaign bottles
It'll only make me try harder
I can't keep my eyes off you
So hypnotized by the way you move
And I just wanna know
Baby what's your name
All I really wanna do is
Tell me what it's gonna take to fuck with you
And some of that good to blow on
I got her started now she don't wanna stop
I can't take my eyes off you
So hypnotized by the way you move
And I just wanna know
Baby what's your name
I wanna get to know you
Shaped like a coke bottle
Ladies so don't you be surprised
If I let you know that this fella right here
Yeah you sexy and cute
Yeah so let's say you the truth
I wanna know you name
I wanna see you get low while I give you dough
And fire to the flame
We step put in the rang
That's real ghetto fame
Surely I over due it for you
I can't keep my eyes off you
So hypnotized by the way you move
And I just wanna know
Baby what's your name
All I really wanna do it get with you
Tell me what I gotta do
I'm sure ya hear it all the time
I don't waste my breath shit... on all that mess
If I said it then I meant it
Not to try to get between ya
To make you a believer
Like these champaign bottles
It'll only make me try harder
I can't keep my eyes off you
So hypnotized by the way you move
And I just wanna know
Baby what's your name
All I really wanna do it get with you
Tell me what it's gonna take
And the way she moves
I love the way your bodies so smooth
I love the way she flows to the grove
All it took was one look in her eyes
Get them swirls in my eyes
Such a site to see to me
The only girl I wanna bite
You make me delighted
You must be the baddest thing I've ever seen
I think I seen you in my dream
Or maybe it was a magazine
With you and your anatomy
I can't keep my eyes off you
So hypnotized by the way you move
And I just wanna know
Baby what's your name
Tell me girl can I talk to you
I'm only in town for one night
Let me know if you're down to ride
I'm only in town for one night
Let me know if you're down to ride
If you think you're lonely now
I know I've been on the road
And what I'm gonna do
When I have you alone
You heard the message on your cell phone
I'm about to put it down
Half naked around the house
We're making love until
I can tell by the way
There's no other place
I'm that someone who's
Even if I'm home for just one night
Your love is got me never wanting to
Tell me girl can I talk to you
I'm only in town for one night
Let me know if you're down to ride
I'm only in town for one night
Let me know if you're down to ride
The way you move that body
I just want to know can I tell you this
I want to roll with tonight
I'm at the double tree
I got an early flight
Better than to kick it
You can call it what you want
You want to talk naughty
If your down for mine uh
Is have a party for 2
Tell me something girl
Tell me something girl
You down to make it hot
Love the way I touch you
Telling me you want more
We're on another level
Got me serving you now
Tonight's the night we'll
If I'm ever in your spot
Tell me girl can I talk to you
I'm only in town for one night
Let me know if you're down to ride
I'm only in town for one night
Don't they know that I don't give a fuck about what they got
This ain't your boy from New York or that Compton cat
I'm a hit you till I hit you then go hit you in back
I put 17 of those on a old school cut
Big Head touched down better get on your shit dog
Mr. officer get off my dick. I'm to the good
Third coast muddy water
Candy yams and collard greens
Rubber bands in my pocket
If you need it then I got it
If I want it then I cop it
We still win so we still ball
We still hood so fuck the law
I got nuts and I got loot
If you can't see the king
Third coast muddy water
Candy yams and collard greens
Hit the club by the bar
She was bound to fuck a pimp
With my shrimp on my plate
Third coast muddy water
Candy yams and collard greens
A superhero in the flesh
When they advance me this check
What you expect when you ain't have shit
And they ain't paying half of what you asking
Couldn't even see the pussy even if it's Cassie
They quote what I spit like Confucius
Like what clique you in
The Beamer or the Benz
Like here we go again
Don't sit at my table
If you ain't popping champagne after every game then don't pop shit
Homecoming queen with my picture in her locket
But I know what's up with her hands in my pockets
You voted most likely to never ever top this
Just in case you was wondering
And they wonder why we bang
Questions rushing in my brain but I'm too proud to ask
And I just want to be fly
I'm feeling like hustling
Running in so much work with school buzzing in
Either get rich or die poor
Looking for the answers to my problems in the Bible
My conversations with God always seem leave him speechless
The cars and the broads and the kicks
Is something to strive for when you ain't never had shit
That be the day that the rubber bust or I have a kid
The pride to all the things that my father did
Cause the momma was a groupie and I was on some rapper shit
They gave me Hell like I asked for it
I guess I didn't swag enough
Steady acting like I ain't had enough
Ten chains on your neck like you ain't flash enough
The game's a pound of Reggie
I wish I was a kid again
On the phone all night with the girl I like that she claims she's freak
Rise and Shine get up off my ass and mash for cash
No time to procrastinate
I write a bucket it's kinda of rusty but I blast the base
On the road again for the pros we in
The block used to be sunny but they snowed it in
Now the junk is great taste for the dollar menu
Maybe the dope boy baby needs some new clothes
Hot as ever been but I'm cooling it ah
While I used to run in places sometimes
Sometimes I wish I was a kid again
On the phone all night with the girl I like that she claims she's freak
I wanna go to church but ain't no good reverends
To pay the busing responsibilities that I disown
I'm hollering get going
But it's hard to get off when you can't get on
I brought my life on this wax nobody listens songs
Looking at the world through my broken rear view
Sometimes I wish I was a kid again
On the phone all night with a girl I like and she claims she's freak
Mrs. Linnie outside in her garden
My brother his son and his daughter
Ooh ooh it would be cool to go back
But now where we at with no regrets I'm waiting on what's next
I wish I was a kid again
On the phone all night with the girl I like and she claims she's freak
Your motherly hands used to usher Sunday mornings played the tambourine so well reminiscing on my granddaddy shed tears as you look at his pictures on the shelf phone ringing everyday friends gone away wishing you could go but you had to stay I sit and cried with you soon the villains of the past aware one day that you pack your bags turn to me and ask don't fret when I leave this earthly body of mine done did all of its deeds crawled till it walked and held all it could breathe carry on what I taught you was given through HE to you from me in times like this believe I got a call like you used to get just the other day they told me you'd gone home to stay
I got these voices in my ear
Wake up to the sound of a million horns
Jesus piece ruby red diamonds in the thorns
Say a prayer for the Jammed and the one's that's gone
Did it big in the club with my cash out
But dealing with a lot so I drunk until I passed out
With a brawl I met a broad with her ass out
In the ville up on my tip with her glass out
I got these voices in my ear
I got these voices in my ear
I got these voices in my ear
I got these voices in my ear
What if a dream was all you had
If you can't buy the finer things before you exit
I swear my biggest fear is that I'll die a nobody
It seems like nothing left
Lately I been feeling like fuck it
Heavens in my face but Lord knows I can't touch it
Plus I heard the angel wings was kind of heavy
Death knocking on my door I can get it
Looking through the peep hole in case I ain't ready
Fuck this rap shit yeah I said it
On the road to the riches ain't no telling where I'm headed
And during all the shit to be a king
It's when the lights get dim and the people get quiet
They been standing in line for hours at a time
Just to see you you hit the stage.
Deep down in your gut.
That's when the DJ hit the replay on the track
He might just shut it down.
And you pass your drink to the broad with the dank
Like baby girl hold it down
Then they hand you a mike that's all you need.
Peek out the curtain and all you see
To tell them a story that'll set them free
And that there my friend is how you begin
Praying for the future but I'm dealing with the past
Like the cries under the sun know when big mama pass
You gotta get up get out and get something
Nothing ever comes to those that just wait
Don't never lose sight of your goal just keep straight
Gotta fight to the death of my family
Slam dunk hang time like a canopy
Tired sitting on the couch
You gotta get up get out and get something
Why rest when all the world running
Nothing ever comes to those that just wait
Get up of your feet like it's the first time you've seen it
You want this money don't be scared ho show me
Cause all I wanted was some rims on the candy car
Get up of your feet like it's the first time you've seen it
Mainstream is cool but in my heart forever underground
Get up of your feet like it's the first time you've seen it
Yeah I remember it so clearly
Shrimp and the lobster that I heard about
I was like 13 thirsting for a good beat
Writing rhymes on my glove so I will never forget em
Besides I ain't rapping about dope nor did I sell it
I guess the story of a country boy just ain't compelling
Except my soul in the firm belief there is a God
I think my grandma pulled some strings on the low
That's between her and the lord I'll ever know
It's safe to say that dreams come true I guess
Just know that I was once considered just a dreamer
But I paid my dues and turned so many doubters to believers
You know sometimes dreams do come true
Candy coated pearl with the bowling ball swirl
Now this could be one of those days
Just pretend that I'm paid
Candy coated pearl with the bowling ball swirl
Now this could be one of those days
Going in going hard like a superstar
Break the bank full tank take me super far
Candy coated pearl with the bowling ball swirl
Candy coated pearl with the bowling ball swirl
It ain't a single if it don't fly
It ain't a hit if it don't ride
They say money make the World go round
You never lost till you lose your crown
And they don't love you till you're on the ground
Or when you're maxing out your bank account
Even if it means you don't live it right
And even if it means you don't survive the night
But if even if you do you won't survive the hype
Push it to the limit just to get up high
Ride around town like I never lived in it
I'm that real with it
Got my eyes on the prize
Wanna buy a bottle but I ain't paid my ties
I make run the plane never have to land
I make it where them lames never stand a chance
You either fall or you grind the rails
So watch me get it how I live
Gotta keep ya finger on the trigger
I just call it how it is foe
I would come around more often but I can't stay
If I was paid with no knowledge of two months late on my mortgage in the hood
That ain't save I'd do the same thing
Marinate the scene with my high beams
This is my time machine
Gave me game as we roll down the 8th street
You got your family and your friends when you need relief
There'll come a time when I can't be there when you need me
When it come to music yeah you need that
Forever in the cut where you be at
I couldn't understand it then
But you know that I'm grown
Marinate the scene with my high beams
This is my time machine
Rushing in the hallway trying to keep these waves flat
My brother was a player I was favorite off many streets
Learning who's paying dudes made myself a name
Even as a youngster knew I'd be a king
Mississippi is where I'm from and that the shit I claim
It's funny how they flock when they heard you got that knot
Marinate the scene with my high beams
They love to give me that
You know you want to ride on my locomotive
You best grab your bags
Now let me break it down... before we go
Don't hold back what the good Lord gave you...
Now all aboard for all of those that claim they down to get it
I advise you to exit right now if you ain't down wit it
I'll show you how to get off if you just listen
You'll never want to leave here if you just visit
I hope she got a ticket
You know you want to ride on my locomotive
Fuck what they are talking
Na It ain't about talent
It's no longer an art
Farther than you rolled before but still you block the road some more
I'm on my last leg and they just passing me by
With a sign that say I rap to eat and both my thumbs in the sky
Till a nigger run up all you and unload
When God come to collect I hope you got what you owe
Wishing on a star for help
I give a nigger food for thought
He rather starve himself
I think it was the shine that got us blinded
They say ignorance is bliss
The game is just not records and real shit
They don't like to play
Tap your feet tip your brim and sell it back to your kin
I don't rap I spit hymns
My Gods bigger than them
Try to blacken your heart and say were children of men
It's funny how the sun will up and battle rain
Too much shine can dull the soul
How can the Devil take my brother if he's close to me
When he was everything I wasn't but I hoped to be
If the time come will you save me if I ask for help
Send my mind on a journey to the outermost
He stopped when he had such a long way to go
She called my phone and talk to me as her eye was swelled
I put my problems in box beside my tightest rhymes
Trade my materials for a peace of mind
Maybe I should write another song about pimps and hoes
I don't need jail to be behind bars
I never wished to be the burden bearer
But souls need saving and it's now or never
Shock value is all they wanna see
Forgive me if I ever ever stilled you wrong
The radio don't play the shit I used to love
Or maybe I'm just growing up
I never seen a star on a red rug
If I wanna see a stars I just look above
I hope you give your all
You gotta play until the end
The only difference between a winner and a loser is
A winner plays until he wins
Ain't nothing for free so get your ass up
My partner said if we don't speed then they might pass us
Nowadays hoes claiming that they crushing
One second on the clock and the shot's all yours
Trading bust it babies for fly divas that buck
Her only concern is if my car match her clutch
I hope you give your all
You gotta play until the end
The only difference between a winner and a loser is
A winner plays until he wins
They told me life is what you make it
I'll lend you bars if you need rhyme or reason
Just be aware that everybody ain't your friend
From a Super Bowl Championship and it was down 4
With other players that play the game
Pass the knowledge on to your team but carry the flame
Put God first and free your soul
I hope you give your all
You gotta play until the end
The only difference between a winner and a loser is
I can't play the sidelines with all my folk in the stands
Giving up just ain't a part of the plan
I can't play the sidelines while they still chill
I can't play the sidelines so put me in coach
Felt an impact like a truck hit me full contact
I can feel it in my soul
This my last chance to shine but they know I'm getting old
Since I took a fall from greatness
Now I knowing when it rains on my homecoming
I can't play the sidelines with all my folk in the stands
Giving up just ain't apart of the plan
I can't play the sidelines while they still chill
I can't play the sidelines so put me in coach
This a long shot but I trained all my life
And he ain't started since the moment that he signed
Physical training and all
Ain't no complaining at all when they overturning your call
We out here fighting like dogs in every man backyard
Trying to get what was lost reimbursed
Just to be a ghost on the wall
I can't play the sidelines with all my folk in the stands
Giving up just ain't apart of the plan
I can't play the sidelines while they still chill
I can't play the sidelines so put me in coach
It's late but I'm out on the creep
It's been a while since I heard you speak
Hard to rest when I've been on this road
All I want is you next to me because you help me sleep
Trying to fall through just to fuck with you
Get the cup full of drank and I'm filling my tank
For doing what I can to be a better man forgetting you know that
Feeling good feeling great when I pull off your lace
And ease it in and ease it out
Yeah I was working earlier but baby girl I'm on the way
It's either you or this music but I can't make up my mind
I settle for less so when I'm tired of stress
I go through with the motions pretending I'm at my best
But this ain't what I expect because my life is a wreck
Money comes and it goes till family's all I got left
You'll be hollering out next because you're ready to fly
I can't find the words so you'll just fill in the blanks
I'm doing the norm and not what it takes
I'll keep folding my cards and you'll keep raising the stakes
Till we forget about us and what we have is too late
King is much more than the weight of a crown
Being single is cool till ain't nobody around
I can't be what you want me to be
One minute you're calling out for the D
Then the next minute you wanna be free
Then the next minute you hollering out peace
Although I know it's a war and they'll be blood in the street
If you call don't be frustrated at me
And that don't make it harder to cheat
Being friends would make it harder to breathe
But if you're willing to try then I'm willing to leap
Out of the window of pain and fall in love at your feet
I ain't the man you want me to be
Natural women and mind frame elevators
Ten toes down with this experimental south sound
Dope up the lines enough to go around
And around and around this world thrice over
Take you to where the grass is much greener
Putting in work for my redeemer
Yea that's the most high
But like saved souls and warm welcomes at front doors
Don't let your problems weigh you down
Don't let them burdens slow yo pace
The quickest way from A to Z is straight
Haters scatters like jacks do
Don't drop the ball unless you can pick up
All the weight that a winner has to
Don't let the struggle outlast you
Even if society outcasts you
Stand strong in your belief
The mountain top ain't hard to see
When you let God and let be
With jump like juke joints
Shine like gold grills
Curls and chrome rims
Bitch you know what it is
Live from the underground railroad
Them J's look clean son but elevate to gators
I took that shit to heart plus I dug it like a crater
Ice cold water with the flow minus the lemon
With jump like juke joints
Shine like gold grills
Curls and chrome rims
Bitch you know what it is
Live from the underground railroad
When I lean and crawl couldn't see me with your high beams
Plus we sit taller than Monster trucks in them trailer park
My candy coated it cost a grip but I had to blow it
Forever tinted so you can't peep while your bitch up in it
Cold blooded ain't it but that's how it be when they want that cash
When you ain't around anybody can be in that ass
And find some paint to put some swirls in
With jump like juke joints
Shine like gold grills
Curls and chrome rims
Bitch you know what it is
Live from the underground railroad
We make it cool to be southern
We make it cool to be southern
We make it cool to be southern
We make it cool to be southern
We make it cool to be southern
Collard green pockets but I southern fried the flow
Candied yam drop with some cornbread to throw
I got a surefire way to give the game what it came for
We make it cool to be southern
We make it cool to be southern
We make it cool to be southern
We make it cool to be southern
We make it cool to be southern
Let me take you down this country road
The type of fresh that you can comb through
Or you can cut it with a butter knife
And spread it on the brain of a dame for some change
But that's only if you cut it right
Lord knows I ain't seen it with my
I been this way since I was knee high
Bird's eye view with my frame on lean
We make it cool to be southern
We make it cool to be southern
We make it cool to be southern
We make it cool to be southern
We make it cool to be southern
I make it cool to be southern
We make it cool to be southern
We make it cool to be southern
We make it cool to be southern
We make it cool to be southern
Big backyard with a house on the hill
Old school whip with some big ass rims
Cause that's what I do
If you think I'm out here tricking these hoes
Big backyard with a house on the hill
Old school whip with some big ass rims
Now I suppose I'm doing quite all right
Never worry about me or worry about mine player
But you gotta get your own
When I'm traveling down the boulevard
Big backyard with a house on the hill
Old school whip with some big ass rims
Slamming on these doors
Trunk beat till it crack
Big backyard with a house on the hill
Old school whip with some big ass rims
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Why the fuck you came
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Don't you see the grill
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Why the fuck you came
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Wait a minute motherfucker
Old school car with the grill
Top fell off and ain't shit I can do about it
And you ain't seen a pimp until you seen me on the corner
Last time your bitch chose me but I ain't want her
What you know about it
My gift of gab came with a bow on it
So if you grind and you down for the smashing
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Why the fuck you came
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Don't you see the grill
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Why the fuck you came
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Wait a minute motherfucker
Don't you wanna rest off in this glass house
If I let you ride set that ass out
Don't play me like no trick that's just so overrated
Sucker motherfuckers never blocked me
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Why the fuck you came
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Don't you see the grill
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Why the fuck you came
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Wait a minute motherfucker
I knew a bitch named Mandy
She had a lisp so I asked her could she deep throat
I said baby don't you worry just get down on your knees
Cause some warm head will turn me up a couple degrees
So just throw your lips around this anaconda and squeeze
I say all women are freaks they just need an excuse
That's why I stay strapped up when I'm knocking the boots
After midnight don't play no motherfucking games
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Why the fuck you came
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Don't you see the grill
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Why the fuck you came
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
And you can't do nothing but fall
Police hit the block and make it hard for us to hang
World fucked up and I can't seem to leave the game
I did all I could in my city so I have to bounce
I signed my deal and got more haters than I care to count
It's hard to celebrate for others when you're dying poor
I crank my system till it's clipping then I let it thump
Put all my problems in my cup while I grip the wheel
A country boy trying to make these petty ends meet
Make room for me in case my plane just ain't meant to fly
I can feel your pain through the phone
I promise not to stay too long
I'm tired of the landlord tripping on us
I know just how it be when you in between the sheets
While I'm in the streets thinking need to be at home
When I'm on the shine ain't no telling when I'm coming home
Remember that you said that pussy mine
In that time you'd meet at the door with no panties on
Cause you could cum till your heart content
I wanna see them eyes when I surprise ya
Back out on the road again
I really wanna talk on the phone
I mean the money can't change how you feel right now
Even harder cause you bother once the sun goes down
Wonder where I'm going after shows and such
I pray you understand this ain't over night
I'll be on the next flight on my way back home
I wanna see them eyes when I surprise ya
I won't take too long baby
I can't stay away too long
I wanna see them eyes when I surprise ya
I won't wait too long baby
Yawn and take her my beat up
That I can kick my feet up
Now she wanna ride high
With her head in the sky
Look down on all her people
I was told to jump in
And camp fire the Amazon my dogs
I shouldn't thought of Po
From them strippers that love
Transformers can't fuck with this
That the way my dough flip
Skyscraper tall when I creepy crawl
Rise to the apes in my trunk
Said bitch I pulled up on your turk
Straight pilled off with yo girl
Said she wanna ride with it
And my backseat softer than a pillow top
Pants so wet that it hit the spot
With the world grand wheel
Like it's nineteen ninety six
Tank just don't say beg for mercy
And Mac can do what he feel like
And fold the boll so I peel right
Turn the grill on that woman
I drop the top and you see me
Got different shit on this TV
The one that finally score up that aisle
For my city I pull on
For life and I'm gone
We don't wanna play no games
I gotta watch out for the curb
Spot a little bad chick around my way
Don't like haters and I don't like feds
Peep this game just to get this dough
Throw it in the air when you hit this floor
Maybe when you couldn't see when I crept up slow
Watch yo head when I open my door
Dark in the club with a pimp on glow
Everybody saw me take yo ho like
Be a pimp tight player like I'm supposed
I'm like show me where them dollars at
Scheme my zebra shopping bag
You ain't spending then don't holler back
It's been a long time since I felt this way
It's been a long time since I felt this way
It's been a long time since I felt this way
It's been a long time since I felt this way
Mix the drank with the dank got me got me got me
Had that smoke that smelled like dumpster
When I was sober off in the yo I never rhymed like this
Well all I know is that my world is super slow
It's been a long time since I felt this way
It's been a long time since I felt this way
It's been a long time since I felt this way
It's been a long time since I felt this way
Mix the drank with the dank got me got me got me
It's getting harder to explain the way I feel when I'm zoned
Perfect combination of elevation had me tipping slow
I never knew the strength of the drink until I melt away in my couch
And dream about the things I never had and all the places I couldn't go
Tried to play it cool around my folk but I was fucked up on the low
All the worries of this life and blew it out my chest
It's been a long time since I felt this way
It's been a long time since I felt this way
It's been a long time since I felt this way
It's been a long time since I felt this way
Mix the drank with the dank got me got me got me
But I'm steady getting higher as the sweet meets the fire again
See me I'm bobbing and weaving but he's choking me and cheating mane
Wanna stay grounded but somehow gravity pulls me up
Let me grab a hold before I crash land
I give a damn about a hater and his whole crew
No jump shot so I'm selling crack
I never knew what pain was until I was grown
I never miss my home boy until he was gone
If I fall by the river bed
And I'll just rest my head
Get it how you live little J Smith
But that ain't all so if I call
If I fall by the river bed
And I'll just rest my head
I held her tight like I never held before
But things change when you get older
That's when I told her
Now we don't see eye to eye
I think it's best that I said goodbye
If I fall by the river bed
Remember a child's places what I often heard while asking
About the things no adolescent could imagine
Trying on the pants of a man I had not yet become
Hands too small to button the buttons my father often fastened
While speaking on his dreams and ambitions
Although I could never understand
Be a better man in a world of negligence
When they settling for settlements
Only 14 when I first cut
And thank God for them condoms that my papa gave me
Never in a sense of money spent
Christmas trees are beautiful without presents up under them
No superheroes on TV you used to see
I remember when I fell from my first bike
That's when I realized that getting up is only half the battle
The fear of falling off will haunt me well into my teens
The moment that the world took a shit upon my dreams
Guess I was on the road
Didn't know which way to go
I think I hear a praying man coming
Sometimes I couldn't read the signs
My people done left me behind
I think I hear a praying man coming
I think I hear a praying man coming
Stopped at me and asked why so sad
Perhaps because they had taken what I had
I'm sure it wasn't much to them but it was all that I could grab
But what's worse I'm not sure how long I've been swaying in the breeze
Tired of talking to the trees and you the first praying man that I've seen
I'm glad you looked up because most people pay no mind
Guess I was on the road
Didn't know which way to go
I think I hear a praying man coming
Sometimes I couldn't read the signs
My people done left me behind
I think I hear a praying man coming
I think I hear a praying man coming
Asked me how I got far from the beach
I was stacked on top of my folk and it was really hard to breathe
It was a little hard to believe that I had been caught up in this mess
And some of my own people would sell me to my death
It was a lot of us on the ride and it was a lot of us that was lost
But some of us couldn't take it so some of us jumped off
And I'm really glad you found me on your course
I been out here for a while and there's no sign of the shore
Guess I was on the road
Didn't know which way to go
I think I hear a praying man coming
Sometimes I couldn't read the signs
My people done left me behind
I think I hear a praying man coming
I think I hear a praying man coming
Driving along the road
He asked me what I was running from and where I was trying to go
And I knew they'd come for me and Lord knows I wanna live
To be running from these dogs with no shoes up on my feet
I heard of this railroad that ventures underground
And takes my kind of people to a place that we can't be found
Guess I was on the road
Didn't know which way to go
I think I hear a praying man coming
Sometimes I couldn't read the signs
My people done left me behind
I think I hear a praying man coming
I'm going live from the underground
I'm going live from the underground
I'm going live from the underground
I'm going live from the underground
This world will let you down one day
Just let down your guard
I got to get a move on
I got to get a move on
I got to get a move on
I got to get a move on
Only the good Lord knows my wrongs
Trouble is the damn devil won't leave me alone
I'm going live from the underground
I'm going live from the underground
What a difference a day makes
The winding road of my uncertainty
That undying feeling of urgency
Did I really give my all
I know today gonna be the best day of my life
Gotta keep my head out the clouds and my feet on the ground
Yeah you gave your all to get your back from off the wall but you can give more
I know today gonna be the best day of my life
It's a good idea to speak up for them
And it's always good to thank God
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
Be prepared for the world and be thankful of the time that I get
To be young on the run
You'll look back when you turn 21
Wishing you were you here by my side
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
Baking your fruitcakes for Christmas Eve
The smell of sweet potato pie make it hard to leave
I been doing the same
Accepted that you're gone but I deal with the pain
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
I hope you give your all
You gotta play until the end
The only difference between a winner and a loser is
A winner plays until he wins
Ain't nothing for free so get your ass up
My partner said if we don't speed then they might pass us
Nowadays hoes claiming that they crushing
One second on the clock and the shot's all yours
Trading bust it babies for fly divas that buck
Her only concern is if my car match her clutch
I hope you give your all
You gotta play until the end
The only difference between a winner and a loser is
A winner plays until he wins
They told me life is what you make it
I'll lend you bars if you need rhyme or reason
Just be aware that everybody ain't your friend
From a Super Bowl Championship and it was down 4
With other players that play the game
Pass the knowledge on to your team but carry the flame
Put God first and free your soul
I hope you give your all
You gotta play until the end
The only difference between a winner and a loser is
They said it couldn't be forever
The grain ain't enough
You gotta mix it with the leather
Your grind ain't enough
You gotta mix it with the hate
When it's all over watch what I say
I dedicate this to them haters that's in my grill
Them doubters and them non believers that said I wouldn't
I put it on the line and do what I love and above all have hope
They said it couldn't be forever
The grain ain't enough
You gotta mix it with the leather
Your grind ain't enough
You gotta mix it with the hate
When it's all over watch what I say
If you never been to the top it's something that you gotta see
They said it couldn't be forever
The grain ain't enough
You gotta mix it with the leather
Your grind ain't enough
You gotta mix it with the hate
When it's all over watch what I say
I dedicate this third verse to all the candy coaters and the slab riders
Record breakers that did mad favors when they knew no one ever heard about us
Fact remains that I'm still the same and I'll never change or settle
They said it couldn't be forever
The grain ain't enough
You gotta mix it with the leather
Your grind ain't enough
You gotta mix it with the hate
When it's all over watch what I say
I remember way back in the day
Can't be turning on a dime cause the rims scrape
That's my prized possession in recession kept me straight
I'd rather sit higher than bald eagles on shoulders of giant people
Forever official like words out the scripture
And hitting them potholes
You gotta ride clean and ride slow
MC 24 crawling through the traffic
That got them some golds and copped them some gators
Fresh than a motherfucker I knew what it took
The thing that I'm giving you couldn't get out a book
If you can't get you no old school don't go fucking with mine
MC 24 crawling through the traffic
I be popping my collar till I'm dead in a tomb
MC 24 crawling through the traffic
It feels good to have it
Knowing that I did what I could
It feels good to have it
I put the leather on top of the wood
It feels good to have it
I rode chrome all around my streets
It feels good to have it
Feels good to have it
MC 24 crawling through the traffic
This for all my country folk
Slamming them Caddy doors
Sitting out on the porch
Fresh from head to toe
This for all my Southern kin
Be proud of who you is
No matter where and when
This for all my country folk
Hoping all those stars and planets align together
Tell all them haters congratulate us or fall back
Get flipped by dope boys that park rims on the curb
Whispering that I got next to execs
That never heard of Mississippi lyricists
Not even visionaries envision this
This for all my country folk
Slamming them Caddy doors
Sitting out on the porch
Fresh from head to toe
This for all my Southern kin
Be proud of who you is
No matter where and when
This for all my country folk
Fighting for every yard across the poverty line
Any given Sunday could be my last
Pay my tithes with the gas money or let the plate pass
Cause God can understand the lows
The feeling of being stranded on the side of the road
Watching all the fancy cars come and go
When you need the sunshine like the most
But even a magnolia fights to grow
Under certain circumstances similar to yours
Cause success never ever save your soul
I came from the bottom of the map to show
The world that it's more to us country folk
This for all my country folk
Slamming them Caddy doors
Sitting out on the porch
Fresh from head to toe
This for all my Southern kin
Be proud of who you is
No matter where and when
Watching out for traffic control
Too hard to be crushed
Hoes hop up out they jeans
Jaws drop up on the scene
When that plane be super clean
Like something out of a dream or a movie
Even with the highs and lows
Pull up in that old ride
I get ya where you wanna
That's if ya calling out to me from the stands
Watching out for traffic control
Too hard to be crushed
Summertime and feeling fine and drinking forties
With my kinfolk playing spades and still debating
Turn it up to the max like goodness gracious
The way it knock on the pavement hear me in Asia
Becoming one with the sun like a space invader
Another shot just before it I don't need a chaser
When you in my plane hangar
Watching out for traffic control
Too hard to be crushed
Watching out for traffic control
It's either you or this music but I can't make up my mind
I settle for less so when I'm tired of stress
I go through with the motions pretending I'm at my best
But this ain't what I expect because my life is a wreck
Money comes and it goes till family's all I got left
You'll be hollering out next because you're ready to fly
I can't find the words so you'll just fill in the blanks
I'm doing the norm and not what it takes
I'll keep folding my cards and you'll keep raising the stakes
Till we forget about us and what we have is too late
King is much more than the weight of a crown
Being single is cool till ain't nobody around
I can't be what you want me to be
One minute you're calling out for the D
Then the next minute you wanna be free
Then the next minute you hollering out peace
Although I know it's a war and they'll be blood in the street
If you call don't be frustrated at me
And that don't make it harder to cheat
Being friends would make it harder to breathe
But if you're willing to try then I'm willing to leap
Out of the window of pain and fall in love at your feet
I ain't the man you want me to be
Just the other day when I was out at the store
That same motherfucker used to bang on my door
Not sure if that was metaphoric or if he had seen one today
I know what he said but maybe I beg to differ
The only souls you like to touch were the legs of strippers
Only God can save us all what he spoke to me
What he hoped to be was a better man in due time
In the neighborhood package store
Get some wine for spirits
Some gossip for your mind if you down to hear it
In the neighborhood package store
Silver and gold for the low
And some papers for your woes you can roll
In the neighborhood package store
Mixing the good with the bad
In the neighborhood package store
Of the neighborhood package store
From a hoodlum on the block
You'll get shot if you refuse to come up off that
You know we out here like wolves searching for antelope
So he went on to loosen up on the aggression
And proceed to lecture me on the troubles of recession
Addicted to the feeling of wine
In the neighborhood package store
Get some wine for spirits
Some gossip for your mind if you down to hear it
In the neighborhood package store
Silver and gold for the low
And some papers for your woes you can roll
In the neighborhood package store
Mixing the good with the bad
In the neighborhood package store
Of the neighborhood package store
Codeine purple seem to take me to the edge
One more shot all I need just to hit the ledge
Been a customer so why they play me
In the neighborhood package store
Get some wine for spirits
Some gossip for your mind if you down to hear it
In the neighborhood package store
Silver and gold for the low
And some papers for your woes you can roll
In the neighborhood package store
Mixing the good with the bad
In the neighborhood package store
And we ain't tripping on the sun because the stars out
And we ain't tripping on the sun because the stars out
Holler at my partner for some drank that I could pour
Horizontal sideways trunk might explode
Headed to the spot where the strippers show me love
Trying to get my mind off my bitch back at home
And we ain't tripping on the sun because the stars out
And we ain't tripping on the sun because the stars out
Gotta play it safe drop my bait while she bite
It's something about that pussy when it's gushy under lights
She claims she knows my name and she seen me out in public
Agreeing in whatever that I tell her she'll bust it
I showed her what I'm bout and turned her out soon as I touched it
And we ain't tripping on the sun because the stars out
And we ain't tripping on the sun because the stars out
Drank in my tank turn me up to a thousand
Crank it to the max while she shake it from the back
Told her turn around and scrub the ground to the beat
Set that ass on my lap and whisper this to me
And we ain't tripping on the sun because the stars out
And we ain't tripping on the sun because the stars out
Excuse my tone of voice but today was just a bad day
Label hit me about another single and said I ain't had play
Hoping my time was near
I just wanna do some right with the wrongs I was dealt
First quarter got me like boiling water with soda in it
Drop my project in the pot watch it lock up like those in prison
Gotta prove these people wrong that don't see the vision
Two free albums minus label support
Like my accent and my tone make it really hard to listen
I was scarred but I was driven before the politics came
I pushed mine back with fear that they might just do me the same
Goddamn right it's on the wall
I take this shit seriously man
This all I'll ever do and I promise to God I won't let nobody take it from me
I did it for all of mine and all of yours
Ten toes deep in the game I'm in
I'm bound to lose if I'm living in sin
I'm tired of feeling my heart Lord I just wanna scrape it out
I hear the hate and all the betrayal I just gotta phase it out
They stick their noses up and talk down on Mississippi
And they treat you like you never made it
It's late but I'm out on the creep
It's been a while since I heard you speak
Hard to rest when I've been on this road
All I want is you next to me because you help me sleep
Trying to fall through just to fuck with you
Get the cup full of drank and I'm filling my tank
For doing what I can to be a better man forgetting you know that
Feeling good feeling great when I pull off your lace
And ease it in and ease it out
Yeah I was working earlier but baby girl I'm on the way
Time to rest yo eyes now I guess
You've been do for some rest
Just ain't no need to strain in yo brain any longer
It's cool to dream no dream that made you strong
Kept you fresh and on your toes
Cause being broke ain't fun and that pity party I threw is starting to get boring
I know today gonna be the best day of my life
Gotta keep my head out the clouds and my feet on the ground
Yeah you gave your all to get your back from off the wall but you can give more
I know today gonna be the best day of my life
But damn I really miss those times
That soul food's on my mind
Grandma's hands used to usher Sunday mornings
They keep us in and keep folk out but we don't feel safe
As we used to back when we was in a booster
Pull the trigger till the clip gone
But damn I really miss those times
That soul food's on my mind
Some greens just can't be cleaned and you can't wash out the taste
Salted looks and herbs
Some get bruised and battered
Thrown away half eaten as if their seeds never ever mattered
That's why most people don't make love no more
They just fuck and they fight
Grandparents had that kind of bond
But now we on some other shit
Apples fall off of trees and roll down hills
Now nobody comes around here
But damn I really miss those times
That soul food's on my mind
But damn I really miss those times
That soul food's on my mind
What if all the songs wasn't vain
Woke up in a world that was built upon pain
With an attitude like you ain't shit without fame
A white pigment with a budget that's like spending
Infatuated with heaven although I like sinning
Chain necklaces and overzealous bitches
Some things I'd say even if I wasn't speaking to you
Jay said you gotta learn just to live with regrets
Cause you never got a fair chance
They try to tell me that God ain't real
And a chain of big explosions is why I'm here
And a ape decided he wanted to walk upright
I knew that shit could take flight
When my social studies teacher told me gypsies was right
Parents broke now you feeling like the shit in your jeans
And life ain't shit like you see in your dreams
That functions with secret compartments for his pistol and cash
Cause you serve the very plate of steak and shrimp that he eat
And hit your momma house when you can't buy your meals
And you in church everyday but you just get by
And all you really ever wanted was a car and a crib
A little extra to buy something nice for your kids
But the life that you live is the only life that you know
Let it pop a bottle on you
Let it pop a bottle on you
Let it pop a bottle on you
Came to see little D I am ... in the mix
Little while before the deal let it cruise a little ...
I need a patrol got me talking like ...
Old school ... you know when I roll
... Like a surgery all the ... nigger do ...
Late night ... material she just hit the ...
Tell the ... get down on the floor
Let me pop a bottle on you
Let it pop a bottle on you
Let it pop a bottle on you
Let it pop a bottle on you
Let it pop a bottle on you
Let it pop a bottle on you
I am the bottle popper ...
Bitch if you wanna money
Hold your head back and swallow everything for me
... You are fucking with a winner
Baby girl right her my nigger
I swear she is something else
You see me shining girl...
Get down on the floor and tell me
Tell the ... get down on the floor
Let me pop a bottle on you
Let it pop a bottle on you
Let it pop a bottle on you
Let it pop a bottle on you
Let it pop a bottle on you
Get a chopper style like a audience
You already know you ain't hard to hit
Girl your ass is the fattest
Girl your ass is the fattest
I'm in love with a stripper
She a monster on that pole
Is it her make up over a face that pretty
Girl your ass is the fattest
She's the baddest bitch
The center of attention
I can take you to another coast give you all ya freedom
I lick ya between ya hips
We can't rest yet got mo work 2 do
Do it all night I ain't even in a hurry
I wanna love ya I love ya I wanna love ya girl
I wanna love ya I love ya I wanna love ya girl I wanna love ya I love ya I wanna love ya girl I wanna love ya I love ya I wanna love ya girl
You know who this man
It's a party over here nobody care who over there
If you don't want no trouble better get back from me
I'm portrayed as a gangster gonna get that money
I'm on the cover of a magazine
I even got an album out
Now I'm the one everybody wanna talk about
It's a party over here nobody care who over there
If you don't want no trouble better get back from me
I'm portrayed as a gangster gonna get that money
I got ... from the eighties rapped up in rubber bands
It's a party over here nobody care who over there
If you don't want no trouble better get back from me
I'm portrayed as a gangster gonna get that money
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Front and get half the bones in your body broken
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
I'm leaving competitors pissed
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
If you battle L you picked the wrong head
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
Making quick money grip before your ass is out
And clown rappers I'm bound to slay
So here's your chance jack to get loose and let your hands clap
And every time I'm in a jam I always find a loophole
And my raps is unbelievable like aliens and flying saucers
Battles I lose none I make crews run
And nowadays girls want you for your money
And yes I'm living slick and my pockets are thick
Mad chicks be on a brothers tip
When ya sporting jewels and driving in a groovy car
But if you not rich them chicks gonna front on you
No matter how strong your rap
If you got dough you get a ho with a fat butt
And if ya live alone she's gonna pack her suit case
And move in then ya start losing all ya bucks
But when you broke you get no play
It's all about what's in ya pockets not how ya look
That's why you can't talk to just any whore
They want a drug dealer not a scholar
Some girls barely speak but always asking for a dollar
And if you pushing a fresh Benz they'll be ya best friends
Now that you dead broke the girls not speaking
Cause nowadays girls want you to crook
The only thing they can get from Big L is a big...
But when you broke you gets no play
Some girls don't even know me asking me can they get some money
I'm looking nothing like ya poppa
I wouldn't give a chick 10 cent to put cheese on a Whopper
They wanna know why I'm so fly
A girl ask me for a ring and I put one around her whole eye
I hit hoes from the back and don't give a jack y'all
All the girls they ignore you
They act like they never saw you
My crew is in the house
You better surrender before you get smoked
So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
I revive crowds with live styles
Don't hang with jive pals
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that lord prayer
I'm on some murder stuff
And when I talk every verb is rough
Front on this and get beat bad
Step to this and get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice and peas
Microphones I gotta tear
Step to this and get your body blown
And cold take a fags life
The top ten is rocked when its locked in
I got lines that's deeper than a jail
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
Increase the peace that cease cause once I release
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
I should never rhyme cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
And its death in every paragraph
Brothers that was there since the beginning
And last but not least
If you want me to write you some raps G just ask me
Cause on the shelf is where your LP cold stood
And I put more holes in his ass than swiss cheese
In the shower's the only time you get your dick wet
I'm quick to put a slug in a fag brain
I killed my mother with a shovel just like Norman Bates did
Then his ass cold dashed with my cash fast
Knocked on his door and shot his granny through the peephole
I gotta get this money
Stealing runs rampant in Harlem
Gambling runs rampant in Harlem
Run rampant in Harlem
The microphone is through when this rap legend grab it
I'm hitting fine models and stabbing punks with broken wine bottles
I'm choking enemies till they start turning pale
Front and get scarred cause your rap style ain't even hard
And I'm fast to put a cap in a fag chest
And I dedicate this one
To all my peoples from Uptown... and everywhere
Yo where I'm from it ain't cookies and cream
You never know when you gonna get wet
It's best to go the right route and not the wrong one
Cause that's all they show you on the TV screen
But with the cash profit make an investment
And try not to go to the grave like the rest went
And yo it's not even funny
I've seen a lot of my peers give up they careers for some fast money
Before you catch a bullet that was meant for the next man
Or end up with a deep cut
Stay off them corners you'll stay out of trouble
It's the number one crew in the area.
Got fly chicks on my dick that don't even speak English
After you you're gonna get scared next
A tech nine is my utensil
Now it's the dictator who's style is greater
So don't try to front troop
I'm out to collect figures
Not a role model I'm a bad figure
I got it locked like a warden
It ain't shit you can tell me
It's the number one crew in the area
Yo I got a death wish
I want these bitch motherfuckers to try to flip
So I can fill up this clip and stick the gun between they lips like a
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards I'd be missing a whole deck
Cause the microphone let's loose
From 25 consecutive 25 the life is
These were the kids of the prison guards
One two everybody's through
The microphone nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm decked to hawk shit and talk shit
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Please show me where the crack is at
While they quarter crack the sack I crack they backs like cracker jacks
So I'm the one you should run from
No way you could stop
I shock pop and drop when jay gets hot
When I'm in the zone better hold ya own
No way you can get up when I get down
I shake rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
So ladies step up I get around like a wheel
Bitches will treat me like onyx
Respect that I'll peel a punks cap back and sign it
Through your neighborhood armed with nothing but a rep
Yo ya step up and you'll get played like the small fry
So mess around you'll be a dead man
Head or gut like illegal
I rip tracks wanna say peace to hip hop
I get wreck I'm party arty so hit the deck
I say big up big up it's a stick up stick up
I let it roast and leave your pussy ass comatose
Better dip fast quick fast or you won't last
One blast will put your ass in a body cast
Nine mil on your neck blood spill is still in effect
Never past up a fast buck ask the last duck
His jewels were truck he got his ass stuck
If you die and come back I shoot your spirit
Now your ass is just a holy ghost
You tried to play me to the left
You better put a target on your head
Get beat down and all you hear is gunshot sounds
Because to me it's all about a buck
I used to have a partner in crime by the name of Chuck
Because I'm all about ends and skins
I used to wait until it gets dark
The Big L was cold crazy
Plenty and many brains I bust
Fuck all that stupid shit
But deep down inside you know who you are
And that really gets on my nerve
When a rapper gets the credit that he don't deserve
Some rappers are mad nice and don't even go gold
Because it should be the other way around
One minute you're hardcore and raw
That explain why you lost your fame
And only change with the time
Unless you get dropped like a dime
And never try to look or even sound like another rapper
Just fulfill your own needs
This is how it should be done
And I wonder how the hell they records sell
They raps are stale and frail
They're forced like fairy tales
You got a little airplay because of your beats
Step to this and get ran over like train tracks
Then one day they slow rolled through the hood
They say that my skin was black so they attacked
One murdered my man like it was okay
For the life he ended he got suspended with no pay
Around my way they shot many teens
So take heed to the rhymes I kick
First they get cuffed up
Listen when this brother speak
I'm not only fed up with the cops
But I caught him at the light
And put a bullet right through his windpipe
Dressed in all black never seen in polka dots
No other writes rhymes like these
I'm cool as a light breeze
My lyrics are well writ
I don't roll with punks I only roll with live guys
I had beef with this thief named Randolph
Now he's in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed
So you better leave L alone
Before I reach out and touch you but not with a telephone
Black white or Puerto Rican
I'm gonna slaughter each and
Every crab MC that runs up
When a battle comes up
Give me two thumbs up
I damage all opponents as soon as the bell rings
Yo it's all about me it's a B. I. G. L thing
A lot of rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
One two one two crews I run through
Step to this and get shanked up
I knocked out so many teeth the tooth fairy went bankrupt
And I entertain well because of my brain cells
My raps are hotter than the Bahamas
With Big L you can't swing long
So get behind me and sing cause every hero got a theme song
I'm undefeated that's the stone truth
I take lives with no pride
I just committed a homicide
To take my cash but he didn't last
I'm quick to spot a foe
Even if my grandma violate she gotta go
Facts on tracks I recite well
Everybody be like Mike but Mike wanna be like L
Like Box and Herb and Big Sid
You didn't even let me say what's up to my hoes B
Oh yeah we gotta say what's up to the hoes man
You know what this mean right here baby
Your ice don't shine and your chain hollow
While you front in clubs for hours with the same bottle
That's like china without rice
Or the holy Bible without Christ
Or the bulls without mike
Or hockey games without fights
And listen real closely how I break this slang shit down
Cars is whips and sneakers is kicks
And if you got punched that mean you got snuffed
Hit me on the hip means page me
The food you eat is your grub
Your apartment is your pad
Your old man is your dad
The studio is the lab and heated is mad
The iron horse is the train and champaign is bubbly
A deuce is a honey that's ugly
To guerrilla mean to use physical force
And I love the streets
Ya know me better than that
I'm deadly when I pull the pin out
I knocked a lot of men out
And if a bitch don't like me she must like women
I'm from the danger zone where emcees get slain
We're thugs that never hesitate to squeeze the flame
When I was OT your bitch rode me
First day home I dived in it
Left her thighs dented
See a lot of switch in your walk
Only thugs get rich in New York
Because they sick of all this drag queen shit
Me and Ron hit it up on some tag team shit
A lot of innocent kids got hit
Some hoes treated me like a bum nerve when I was unheard
I push whips while you walk all day
You couldn't get a bitch before you put your tape out
Flamboyant Entertainment
Can't forget my partner
And even if I do conceal my criminal thoughts
Turned snitches that used to be real
The only DJ that could calm me
My firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm
And fuck the world till I'm gone
Word is born you'll get torn
With more game than Ron Harper
You wish you was in the position that I'm in
My lifestyle is far out
Every week bring a different car out
I go to night clubs and buy the bar out... uh...
I'm large on the street scene
With both hands on her tits
If my girl think I'm loyal then that bitch is a fool
I sex them chicks and send them home
Then later on I had to wild out
I got more dimes than that Sprint lady
Yo try to tax and watch the nine mill burst
I've been off the scene over three years
L is rap's most livest cat
The one police wouldn't dare chase
I did a flick and bounced on L's shit
After platinum it's the same thing
Till I pull the steel and make they lover burn
Here's my flamethrower
Corrupt cats kept slug hats
Asked the feds where the bugs at
Now I'm ready for sleep
But first I want spaghetti to eat
In this good Italian restaurant right up the street
I called back on the cell
He told me to listen well as he started to yell
Told her to listen up before she get hurt
Took the steps now I'm out of breath
We know they got stacks
So I just had your back
He gave me the address then I ran outside
But first I took the keys to his van outside
The sit didn't fit in one bag
Man that's four bodies
And after that we ain't sleep for three days
Pulling me over too see if I'm drunk
But I'm sober they wouldn't fuck with me if I drove a nova
And what you make in a year I make in one show
Now you wanna frisk me and search my ride
Call me all kinda names try to hurt my pride
So get that flashlight out of my face
Word up them federals got my phone and my house tapped
Why do I end up in so much shit
Jake wanna lock me up even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see a young brother pockets get thick
Put me in cuffs and crush what I lust into dust
Big joey crack ain't never rat a cat that he know
Since tone deceased it almost killed his mama
And show these kids how legit it is
Shit is real I used to steal but now I own several businesses
Hey yo I'm gonna fry for what I never did
If they said that shit is hot then they told you wrong
I make moves and boss all across the world
So don't be upset if I toss your girl
Bitches sweat me wherever I go
Swing and walk with tall bats
All of y'all weak people fall back
Swing and walk with tall bats
Hot as hell blocks where shells pop
Send you as a gift to the mortician
Lay you down till you get found up in the sprayed Coupe
The seedier row and sheet draped over
Be found on the block with the street taped over
To trade rounds with all you fake clowns get down in the unsafe town
Better watch me round your girl if you ain't fucking her right
You damn player haters never want to see me blow
Flamboyant Entertainment CEO
I never lounge where you find Jake
And I'm a increase the crime rate for old time's sake
Run with me and I'm a make you a star
We quick to put a bullet in a stranger's dome
I'm known to kick a rough rhyme and rock much shine
I can write it or recite it off the top of the dome
They brought it back to the streets cause that shit sell now
Flamboyant is the label that writes the checks
And I'm a run up on y'all and slice ya necks
It's flamboyant y'all
My man was hungry so I dropped him off at mickey d's
Need your help before I get done
And this supposed to be my man and he don't give a fuck
And now them fags is all bloody from the shattered glass
Walked up to the car the creep was stuck in the seat
Then dropped to his knees and begged me please not to squeeze
The other pig ducked behind a big truck
And all I can do was stare
I got weak and fell on my rear
Never gamble with snakes
Let that be a lesson to ya
Flamboyant Entertainment
I asked honey her name and she told me Celeste
And I only lay pipe to dimes
Honey picked me up some dope shirts
Took her to the crib and bombed her with this big brown anaconda
Uh Flamboyant Entertainment
Puffed a bag of hydro then broke out on the low
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
With some bogus ass story that was off the wall
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware
I'm in the breed of the bad guy
Think about me with the smile on your face
Think about me with my hand on your waist
And think about me with your hair in your face
And to say we don't love these hoes is a old line
Honey just save some space in it so you can hold mine
Things she did and how she kissed it
Yo you can't make a hoe a housewife kid
Mack these freaks for your own enjoyment
Peace to the God Sadat X
Now I'm ready for sleep
But first I want spaghetti to eat
And it's a good Italian restaurant right up the street
Told me to listen well as he started to yell
I reach the destination
Grab the heat without no hesitation
Told her listen up before she get hurt
We know they got stacks
We got the cuffs and the duct tape and put it to use
And then I kicked Mike in his face to watch his head jerk back
He gave me the address then I ran outside
But first I took the keys to his van outside
Now that's four bodies
And after that we ain't sleep for three days
Where the track stars come to warm up for a race
I pitch lines like fastballs
And you might lose your life for your jewels and ice
I give young fools advice about the rules of heist
And I never walk the streets without the vest and the chrome
Cause all my jewels be Rocky like Sylvester Stallone
Wanna clown we react... fuck that
Besides y'all don't want it with us
Styles just switch like hips on gay men
Bitch talk slick whole crew get hemmed up
Rip shit flip shit spit shit backwards
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Front and get half the bones in your body broken
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
I'm leaving competitors pissed
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
If you battle L you picked the wrong head
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
It's the number one crew in the area.
Got fly chicks on my dick that don't even speak English
After you you're gonna get scared next
A tech nine is my utensil
I got drug spots from New York to Canada
Now it's the dictator who's style is greater
So don't try to front troop
When your style is played out just like an Oshkosh jumpsuit
I'm out to collect figures
Not a role model I'm a bad figure
I got it locked like a warden
Rap without Finesse is like the NBA without Jordan
It ain't shit you can tell me
It's the number one crew in the area
Yo I got a death wish
I want these bitch motherfuckers to try to flip
So I can fill up this clip and stick the gun between they lips like a
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards I'd be missing a whole deck
Cause the Microphone let's loose
These were the kids of the prison guards
One two everybody's through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm decked to hawk shit and talk shit
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Please show me where the crack is at
While they quarter crack the sack I crack they backs like Cracker Jacks
So I'm the one you should run from
No way you could stop
I shock pop and drop when Jay gets hot
When I'm in the zone better hold ya own
No way you can get up when I get down
I shake rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
So ladies step up I get around like a wheel
Bitches will treat me like Onyx
Respect that I'll peel a punks cap back and sign it
Through your neighborhood armed with nothing but a rep
Yo ya step up and you'll get played like the small fry
So mess around you'll be a dead man
Head Or Gut like Illegal
I rip tracks want to say peace to hip hop
I get wreck I'm Party Arty so hit the deck
I say big up big up it's a stick up stick up
I let it roast and leave your pussy ass comatose
Better dip fast quick fast or you won't last
One blast will put your ass in a body cast
Nine mil on your neck blood spill is still in effect
Never past up a fast buck ask the last duck
His jewels were truck he got his ass stuck
If you die and come back I shoot your spirit
Now your ass is just a holy ghost
You tried to play me to the left
You better put a target on your head
Cause being bad I couldn't stop
I realized that every time I got mad something bad happened
Later they found him hanging from a chandelier
Enemies I be bucking quick
My moms know who I am because she know who she was fucking with
And I kill chumps for the cheapest price
Enemies I got several done
It's Big L and I'm all about taking funds
I'm a stone villain known for killing and raping nuns
Look at my scalp real close and you'll see triple sixes
There's no doubt I'm all about a dollar
I just signed a lifetime contract with the funeral parlor
Instead I tied him up and made him watch me rape his wife
So I popped off mad chunks not junk
I spit in his motherfucking face and then walked off
I died but then I came back to life in another body
The way I'm living is dead wrong
I'm a devil from Hell without the tail or the red horns
Once I put out the crazy order
I'm living up to my extortion image
A kid tried to take L out
Next I took his gun then he dropped to his knees
Shorts I'm taking none
Misbehave and get sent to the grave by the Devil's Son
Crooked corrupted criminal crime boss with cream
I flood the streets with drugs and clock dollars
East coast west coast fiends overdose
Clips of hollow tips with no sympathy
Since 14 I sold morphine for more green
Flea the country to Argentina
East Coast to West Coast you know what I mean
They got the 5 inch screens in the back of the seat
With all kinds of amazing flows
Money surrounded I counted with bathing with Asian Hoes
From cutting up rocks to investing in stocks
Now that's bloods play the chub
East Coast to West Coast you know what I mean
Yo know I'm crazy quick to smack a groupie
East Coast to West Coast you know what I mean
With a silver spoon in they mouth
And had everything handed to them on a silver platter
And never had to work hard for nothing
Then there are some people that was born in the opposite world
And had to work hard for everything they got
And never had nothing handed to them... and never will
I'm only at the age of 10
And life already seems to me like it's heading for a dead end
Cause my moms be smoking mad crack
Too ashamed to walk the streets
Wearing the same cheap sneaks and dirty outfits for weeks
Even my holidays got damaged
It seems like my life's been cursed
I always knew that I'd end up doing time on the Isle
And it still got worse
Soon I ran into a couple of guns
Now everyday I creep with the heat
If I don't steal I don't eat
Then I lost control and started going too far
Then got snatched by the blue car
Where I grew up it was a living hell
One tried to test me didn't find it humorous
Beat him with a pillowcase filled with cans of tuna fish
I hope I don't get snatched by the beast again
But it's getting crazy hectic
And can't get a job cause of my jail record
I even started robbing homeless folks for they change cups
My whole life was deserted
All I tried to do was live the one life that I got
To get you stuck and punch ya lights out
Or catch ya car in the night and snatch ya wife out
And beat the hoe up if you don't give the dough up
I'll probably die from the death penalty
I'm not pussy so I don't need security
I did wet more people than the pool and the beach
Look me in my eyes cause ya handshake don't fool thee
And furious anger on those who attempt to poison and destroy
The heat they ready to talk it out
And put one a you punks in the ground
Put his ear to his chin
Better watch me round your girl if you ain't fucking her right
You damn player haters never want to see me blow
Flamboyant Entertainment CEO
I never lounge where you find Jake
And I'm a increase the crime rate for old time's sake
Run with me and I'm a make you a star
We quick to put a bullet in a stranger's dome
I'm known to kick a rough rhyme and rock much shine
I can write it or recite it off the top of the dome
They brought it back to the streets cause that shit sell now
Flamboyant is the label that writes the checks
And I'm a run up on y'all and slice ya necks
And even if I do conceal my criminal thoughts
Turned snitches that used to be real
The only DJ that could calm me
My firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm
And fuck the world till I'm gone
Word is born you'll get torn
With more game than Ron Harper
You wish you was in the position that I'm in
My lifestyle is far out
Every week bring a different car out
I go to night clubs and buy the bar out... uh...
I'm large on the street scene
My operation got shut off
I can't slide a slut off
I gotta beat my dick to get a nut off
To get cash I gotta beg
Cause every time I reach in my pocket all I feel is my dead leg
The first place that I hit was the corner store
I pulled out and told everybody to get on the floor
I took the cash and I jetted
Cause times is hard on the boulevard
Yo I was robbing people on a regular basis in many different places and all types of races
I'll even rob Jehovah if I catch him right on a late night
Keep a vest G don't try to test me
A red neck police chief tried to arrest me
Because I put 2 in his chest and his motherfucking heart stopped
It's a must I commit crimes
Why should I work for another sucker
When I can do robberies and make G's like a motherfucker
She said she was gonna come at ten
You know I'm not a rude brother yo
But I let Joel in and slammed the door on that other ho
Next thing ya know we went straight to the bedroom
I knocked the boots from New York to Santa Fe
And that bitch burnt me like a gamma ray
Because she gave me gonorrhea
Hoes be hotter than a sauna
But she tried to play me like a statue black
She said in order to be with me you gotta be rich
I was looking smooth with the jewelry
But I must be getting older
And the next time I took a piss
Y'all know the chorus to this shit or what right
Check it out. Let y'all know I ain't to be fucked with
The wolves out because it's sic season
But never really rich
I make the right words blend
Pimp these hoes like I'm Iceberg Slim
And if I go to jail I might serve ten
Then I snatch the ice off they wrists and neck
You better not budge when I point the semi at you
You know the game plan
We never bring luggage
Still run with the same clan
Used to be a Kane fan
Your ice don't shine and your chain hollow
While you front in clubs for hours with the same bottle
I run with the richest cliques
Fuck the thickest chicks
Plus drop the sickest hits
What this motherfucking rap game without L
That's like China without rice
Or the Holy Bible without Christ
Or the Bulls without Mike
Or hockey game without fines
And I dedicate this one
To all my peoples from Uptown... and everywhere
Yo where I'm from it ain't cookies and cream
You never know when you gonna get wet
It's best to go the right route and not the wrong one
Cause that's all they show you on the TV screen
But with the cash profit make an investment
And try not to go to the grave like the rest went
And yo it's not even funny
I've seen a lot of my peers give up they careers for some fast money
Before you catch a bullet that was meant for the next man
Or end up with a deep cut
Stay off them corners you'll stay out of trouble
Hey yo fellas... Keep our eye open... watch out
Cause females be playing a whole lot of games like these
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware
I know this lady by the name of Katie
The type of female the fellas stress
Body got more curves than an S
Within a week she had keys to my res
And then later my man Squeezer gave her gees to invest
Then one day I overheard her talking to friends
Letting that dame use me for my name and my fame
A year ago I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro then broke out on the low
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
With some bogus ass story that was off the wall
So watch out fellas... Watch out
You better watch out fellas
Watch out fellas... You better watch out
I walk through the ruggedest blocks with jewels flooded wit rocks.
Records are forever hot.
Front on me you better not.
This goes out to my people's up town.
My style is hard like strong lumber.
Dime pieces get the digits chicken heads get the wrong number.
When I get busy over bounce tracks.
95 was a beautiful year for L.
Now I'm back and all the ladies still cheer for L.
Whatever I write is gonna be tight.
We bust caps that go through vests.
We only do what we do best.
And that's triple than you riddle men.
I like drop tops when its hot.
I like lambs when its snowy.
Bank account is fat like Joey.
I'm not very religious you wouldn't call me holy.
Spark up the you know what.
And every girl I got looks like a model.
If you ever see me with a chicken then she must of a hit the lotto.
Let me zoom in the boom like Rex
When I'm through your nets
Of course you knew that
I'm ready to get my flirt on
One honey with the skirt on
She got knees that I would love to put some dirt on
And if you wanna be my girl just forget it
It's just room to hit it
When I'm all alone I call honey's on the phone
I used to mate with this honey Kate
When you mention my name it rings a bell
I get the woman loose quicker than gin and juice
And if you wanna be my girl just forget it
It's just room to hit it
Around your girl you shouldn't trust me
Cause soon as you turn your back I'm a slide her off then bust three
And I only lay pipe to dimes
A lot of brothers I know are taking care of kids that might be mines
And matter fact the last time you gave her loot to go shopping
She picked me up some dope shirts
It's because of me why she's walking crooked and her throat hurts
And if you wanna be my girl just forget it

I'm large on the street scene
I knocked a lot of men out
We're thugs that never hesitate to squeeze the flame
When I was OT your bitch wrote me
See a lot of switch in your walk
Only thugs get rich in New York
Because they sick of all this drag queen shit
Me and Ron hit it up on some tag team shit
Used to ride Greyhounds wit dimes hoes who
Stuffed the coke in they ass
A lot of innocent kids got hit
Harlem World be the place of my birth
I push whips while you walk all day
I be a Harlem World party pleaser
Fly clothes and pretty hoes is the price of fame
Everything I rock is name brand
Your ice don't shine and your chain hollow
While you front in clubs for hours with the same bottle
That's like china without rice
Or the Holy Bible without Christ
Or the Bulls without Mike
Or hockey games without fights
Flamboyant is the label I'm with
Chips from here to Acapulco
I love it when a girl ass is fat and they tits firm
I take all the dough my chicks earn
You see me on MTV and Rap City
Squeeze shots and make you check out
Y'all can take me from the bottom and climb with me
I be that young teen with DUMB cream
And listen real closely how I break this slang shit down
Cars is whips and sneakers is kicks
And if you got punched that mean you got snuffed
Hit me on the hip means page me
The food you eat is your grub
Your apartment is your pad
Your old man is your dad
The studio is the lab and heated is mad
The iron horse is the train and champaign is bubbly
A deuce is a honey that's ugly
To guerrilla mean to use physical force
I asked honey her name and she told me Celeste
And I only lay pipe to dimes
Honey picked me up some dope shirts
Took her to the crib and bombed her with this big brown anaconda
Uh Flamboyant Entertainment
Who likes to nag a lot
Talking about the lyrics that he has are hot
I throw rhymes like a quarterback
Front and you'll get bust
For you the time is over
So give me your crown Jack
Because their rhymes are light as
A feather and mine are heavy like a big brick
Rappers catch a fit quick
When I start to kick shit
And I record my battles on a camcorder
So I can sit back and watch me manslaughter
That's why they all got taken out like a pizza box
The crown is still mine
A lot of rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
Or beat eggs or whip cream
I'm smoother than Vaseline
And I'm a stone cold rapping fiend
I control the microphone like a robot
I'm kicking rhymes like a game of kickball
I'm rough like a brick wall
For trying to get with this
I'm too swift for this
A microphone murderer form of magnificence
A def rapper and also a swell one
My hits are consecutive
I'm a lyrical executive
Bite my rhymes and I won't let you live
So to be safe on the microphone homes
Or get your dome blown
Or put in a boot camp
Punks that try to brawl
So stop sleeping on me
My rhymes weigh a ton
Can't kick stupid shit
Battle L and get smoked
Your rhymes are rusty G
You can't fuck with me
That's why you're hiding in protective custody
I hurt them like bunions
Make them cry like onions
I'm a lyrical fighter
In your ass for being a crook
Hit with a vital hook
And get your title took
I'm the microphone murderer
And I'm known for busting mad caps
With rhymes that back slap
You're trying to take your idol's
You're on some buck shit
My rhymes are mad thick
I like it rough and rugged
On beats that I produce
They're softer than paper plates
The lyrics I make is great
A few sheets of loose leaf
Is all I need to write rhymes that are extra fly
Pack a four fifth with eight shots
With one you get popped
And now your locked in a box
I'm not joking. There's no time for snapping
You'll be found face up
Rest in peace to my man Bloodshed
Twenty G's a show bitch three thou just to freestyle
I made this cheese it didn't grow on trees
I never catch cold feet when I hold heat
I catch a fag three o'clock in the morn
I might break your jaw just for glancing
That I'm feared cause my raps are rougher
I cook rappers like a chef
I'm def like Jeff right to left
I hold the forty right because I'm the naughty type
Rhymes I create and I couch ya whole crew
Every crap MC that warms up
When a battle comes up
Give me two thumbs up
Flamboyant Entertainment
When you come home it's on
I wasn't prepared for this I wrote my shit on the spot
Go ahead and let your crew soup you up
I never hesitate to buck my gun
I destroy broads with one verse
Since y'all wanna chit or chat with the powers
Y'all might as well join The Force
I fucked ya bitch but I ain't rape the slut she gave it up
We get drunk and blunted together
You never know what my peeps might do
So please don't be upset if I toss your girl
Better watch me round your girl if you ain't fucking her right
Flamboyant Entertainment CEO
I never lounge where you find Jake
And I'm a increase the crime rate for old time's sake
Run with me and I'm a make you a star
We quick to put a bullet in a stranger's dome
I'm known to kick a rough rhyme and rock much shine
From OB to QB my war rest in peace to bandit
Take a chance to this game of life
Jack D with no ice from south side to the desert
I can write it or recite it off the top of the dome
They brought it back to the streets cause that shit sell now
And I'm a run up on y'all and slice y'all necks
Cause being bad I couldn't stop
I realized that every time I got mad something bad happened
Later they found him hanging from a chandelier
Enemies I be bucking quick
My moms know who I am because she know who she was fucking with
And I kill chumps for the cheapest price
Enemies I got several done
It's Big L and I'm all about taking funds
I'm a stone villain known for killing and raping nuns
Look at my scalp real close and you'll see triple sixes
There's no doubt I'm all about a dollar
I just signed a lifetime contract with the funeral parlor
Instead I tied him up and made him watch me rape his wife
So I popped off mad chunks not junk
I spit in his motherfucking face and then walked off
I died but then I came back to life in another body
The way I'm living is dead wrong
I'm a devil from Hell without the tail or the red horns
Once I put out the crazy order
I'm living up to my extortion image
A kid tried to take L out
Next I took his gun then he dropped to his knees
Shorts I'm taking none
Misbehave and get sent to the grave by the Devil's Son
You would scream too if you know what I did last summer
No shirt mad ice screaming fuck is this nice
Shit spit got a six and I'm fucking ya wife
This time its platinum and it ain't hard to tell
Shit my ice so bright that it glow in the dark
I want his ass cut from his ears to his ribs
Cut his fingers off and send the pieces to his kids
Harlem World Danger Zone that's just the way shit is
Rather pull the trigger than fight I'm dumb lazy
Still cop guns despite the Brady bill
Should they ban guns the answers hell no.
Where no man can withstand to hold his own
Stash math anything in my path smash
Y'all fellas like to stress them chicks
Spend money to dress them chicks
When I bone I'm doubled up in case that chick full blown
Mega ice is what I'm heavy on
Yo try to tax and watch the nine mil burst
I've been off the scene for over three years
And cats is still thirst
So all you unsigned cats who wanna battle get a deal first
I sport the bulletproof fitted hat
That attitude you better get rid of that
I stay strapped I go to sleep with my steel
With a silver spoon in they mouth
And had everything handed to them on a silver platter
And never had to work hard for nothing
Then there are some people that was born in the opposite world
And had to work hard for everything they got
And never had nothing handed to them... and never will
I'm only at the age of 10
And life already seems to me like it's heading for a dead end
Cause my moms be smoking mad crack
Too ashamed to walk the streets

Beat him with a pillowcase filled with cans of tuna fish
I hope I don't get snatched by the beast again
But it's getting crazy hectic
And can't get a job cause of my jail record
I even started robbing homeless folks for they change cups
My whole life was deserted
All I tried to do was live the one life that I got
Thick is how I got my whole click to sound
Thick is how we gets down from town to town
If you didn't know this click can't be touched
We on a world tour with Midnight Marauders and such
Not only holding we bust
Studios get blown from D and D to Mystic
With this shit I'll bomb the nation from a distance
The jewels gotta have patience plus persistence
We rock glass like Rockford
To sum up my career from bottom to top
Date a few sluts then y'all start running your lips a little too much
Other emcees ain't got a chance at all
Flamboyant is the label that writes the checks
Rock Tims with my laces untied
Profile low as if I had an ill vengeance
Life on Earth is just a death sentence
With cold steel if you pose a threat to my neighbor
Your honor from New York to Florida
Besides rolling thick my whole crew be marvelous
When my trigger finger itches
I got a rep that make police jet
Known to get a priest wet
I never beg for pussy like Keith Sweat
Bitches get fucked on the roof when I ain't got no hotel dough
I'm known for yoking jacks
The last thing you want with Big L is a fair one
I beat kids with lead pipes
Old folks get mugged and raided
Crimes are drug related
And we live by the street rules that thugs created
Clowns get smoked about a thousand volts
For selling pounds of coke
Front in this town and get a tech stuck down your throat
I'm quick to blast a goon
And break a motherfucker like a plastic spoon
Tracks I'm know to roast
Until the microphone is ghost
Front and get your brain pinched
Big L will have your whole gang lynched
I started smoking dust and been insane since
This rap shit was a great gift
The other night some snake riffed
And got a hot lead face lift
All through high school I had braids
Stabbing teachers to death that gave me bad grades
Cause my techniques great
Fuck around you'll find my silk boxers in your mother's hamper
Brothers can beg and borrow
Even if they won't let me in Heaven
I disrupt the natural scheme
It's never you run so fast in your life to never have won
Come on and ride the rhythm
Just like the gods I start with knowledge and follow with wisdom
For greater understanding
I'm landing blows and
And God knows he can rap
Me and L put rhythm on the map
Even my thoughts is federal
When I'm creeping through your hood with a thousand little dudes
Um. We're the peace like Islam
I make your eyes rise like yeast
Betcha lyrics jump off the track like racing cars
Emcee's trying to be the best
And we can get down and split the wealth
That's when I found I could do it myself
Rappers I jack and lynch
Nobody can fuck with the way I be killing the shit in rap events
To catch wreck in any cassette deck
My rap style is past great
I love to fuck a bitch from the back and watch her ass shake
I probably got your mommy strung
Never had a gassed head
I stomp white cops till the life stops
Cause my blood is colder than an ice box
On 1-3-9 you don't want a block war
And every time a mack eleven bucks
I'm killing at least seven ducks
I never was a follower of Reverend Butts
And clown emcee's I be attacking quick
Sorry jack but get up out of that
I can't wait to demonstrate this nickel plate
Let me take a little breath... god damn
I'm definitely destined to make eight digits
Met up with L on the road to riches
Ain't none of clowns standing their ground
With the crowned prince of the underground
Sounds like I'm ready to catch wreck now
The heats on sweat now
Shit I got crazy skills
It's a pity the way I'm ripping rugged rhythm through the city
Woke up one morning out some bomb ass cock
My dick kinda limp so I cruise around the block
Call my cousin snoop as I swoop in the coupe
Seen my little homey style who I ain't seen in a while
Got a quarter pound of bud so I'm fucked up two
Now I'm high as a kite
To see what's with my woman and my newborn kid
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
I'm just a dog don't blame me
Hopping like a motherfucker trying to find a hoe
Hitting all the spots but I'm coming up blank
I'm headed to the liquor store to get myself some drank
Continue with my mission
So I can get my pimp on
Cause my pen gets my pimp on from g to ozone
I have pimped my pen in the hot California sun
I have pimped my pen and she is number one in my stable
Pleasure is the reason that she brings daddy his cash
Dripping willows on satin pillows
Dead presidents still getting their fuck on
I'm so happy because ain't nothing like a lollipop
I love it when she brings me the pay
Yeah my hoe brings me mine
For like she says she does
And I believed her when I accept it
Yeah I got pimp bones in my body
But it's all good baby you lose some you gain some
There are some times when I am bad
Then there are times when I am glad
Only for you I do what I do
That's why I'll do the things I do
I met a woman plus a lady that was sweet and unique
If you can handle it baby to come around my way
Am I crazy for pursuing the woman that's bad
So make the greatest moments happen when it's me and you alone
She comes on like my girl goes
She dances to her heritage to shake herself free
And wipes the sweat from her independent dignity with grace
They say that men would drink out of Marilyn Monroe's toast
But not as beautiful as we thought she was
Only for you I'll do the things that I do
Ah letting you know that this gang banging is serious business.
I thank god for my life
What I wanted y'all to do is live right.
Say that in society you gotta be militant.
Till I open up my eyes and discover the ways.
And plus we're dying fast and plus these fools is blasting.
It's no chilling when that man in black is at my door.
And everything that we did build is falling down.
And ain't nothing like living life all day long.
I simply gotta thank god for the life I live.
Thank god I'm just still in this world.
Don't be fake and be yourself to stay true.
Don't play hate and dump at me.
And the situation at hand is a real situation.
Sunny blue skies got me feeling at home
But I'm ten hours away
Brown love like the Bahamas
I'm a Raider for life
Ballers Nation clothes got me feeling all fresh
You'll find me cruising down the block
While I'm checking out the ladies in the pink boots
Now let's scratch the booth for another tom pie
Love to make my rag drop down
When I cruise around my town
Love to make my rag drop down
To make my rag drop down
Accepting hardships is my path when it peaks
It's like everywhere I go the drama follow me
I keep trying to add up numbers but subtractions all you use
I got nothing left to do but run these streets and hunt for clues.
It's like everywhere I go the drama follow me
How I see the same picture and it's always full of pain
Life is cloudy in these pitchers and it always brings rain
Ain't much different if it's prison or the block it's all the same
With Strange involve the fame but it's slow to bring the change
So I'm right back in the game and I don't think that I can change
So I'm right back in position on a mission through the rain
It's like everywhere I go the drama follow me
I'm trying to clear the pitchers with my very last shot
It's like everywhere I go the drama follow me
It's like at this point in my life right now
I need something different or I just need you to let me know
Finally famous in this
Do I really need an intro
Do I really need an intro
Do I really need an intro
Do I really need an intro
I mean look at all we been in
And I look up in the mirror like boy you ain't even finished
And on them nights how we grind till its light out
I waited my whole life to be the man of the hour
I will be the man when I die
And I take their virginity
I put that weed in an uh and pass it
Well I don't give a master two shits
But I treat ya girl like a cheap skate
I need a boat and that need a lake
That need a chef so I feed my safe
I'm Quagmire I fuck hoes
Rolling up like I'm Damian
I feel like the World mine
Throwing house parties so crazy that my crib look like a campus
Play your cards right and I could blow you up
This looks like a job for Captain Planet
The baddest bitches promoting
She put that thong on my groin groin
Got my fronter on her bumper does it look like she towing
So all she wanna do is big
I feel like the World mine
I just want the baddest bitch in the world right here on my lap
Like I never had it at all
She even look better by the end of my glass
Grind hard but a got a lot to show for it
Always had drive like I had to chauffeur it
My team's so true we should get a camera crew
To follow us around and make a show for us
Like I never had it at all
But she forget about her man when they tell her who I am
All all up in my face like you remember who I am
Put her hands down my pants now she rocking Sean John
Man I just ended up on everybody guest list
I'm just doing better than what everyone projected
Knew that I'd be here so if you asked me how I feel
Like I never had it at all
Like I never had it at all
I called and checked in every night and that was not probation
They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation
Just found out about my other other bitch
She said I had enough tries
If you wanna leave fine
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
It'd wouldn't be so hard to leave
I can't make up my mind
So don't tell me you love me
Truthfully I wish I lied more
We were picture perfect and I tore it all apart
But if I pick up all the pieces we could still be a collage
Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms
Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up
I even found another girl that's perfect
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
It'd wouldn't be so hard to leave
I can't make up my mind
So don't tell me you love me
So don't tell me you love me
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me a while
I hope it's not too late
I got my whole life packed inside a suitcase
So I stayed out the navy
Took longer than expected
Came back around like a necklace
I found a man who gave me what I need
I barely gotta text the call back
Now you got a roommate
It's too late for him to be treated equally
Too late for him to make it out the hood legally
Reality is just a technicality
So don't tell me that
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me a while
Alarm clock said I'm too late
And they said I'm too weak
I could use a few weights
So they said I took too long
And don't look too strong
Well how long would you take
Another second maybe second
Maybe third in the worst case
But I can't move crack
And is such a fraction
They way you thinking about your plans
Before your brain hit the pan
Lupe from Chicago land
But both of our chains say made in Japan
German engineers design both of the sedans
Ride with Mr. Right on time
Just an option in this world
But things come and go
When the clocks never stop
Be on time for nothing
A little late for a lot
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me a while
I hope it's not too late
I hope it's not too late
The last thing I wanna hear is too late
Tell me is it too late for me to try and change the world Is it too late to say I wanna change girls
Is it too late even though I'm the shit
Is it too late to tell y'all to suck my dick
I do it too late for what
If I need it I got it
Stop... now make that motherfucker hammer time like...
Drop that ass make it boomerang
Fuck that you gonna get some dick today
I walk in with my crew and I'm breaking they necks
I'm looking all good I'm making her wet
They pay me respect they pay me in checks
And if she look good she pay me in sex
Bounce that ass it's the roundest
You the best you deserve a crown bitch
Stop... now make that motherfucker hammer time like...
I got that mad dick you know it always nut up
And it got a attitude no wonder why it's stuck up
Girl you got me about to pass out
I'm wondering if cupid gave you ass shots
Because I'm in love with that
Stop... now make that motherfucker hammer time like...
And I want all of that
Stop... now make that motherfucker hammer time like...
I'm talking Donald Trump level
I'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard for the shuttle
Got a million on line 1 and
Telling me how much not to spend
Who could get it the fastest
Sipping on shit older than me
I'm living life like a found a fucking check
I'm talking Donald Trump level
I'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
I had a dream about a trillion in cash
I'm back to dreaming what you can't imagine
All my ones that I have is then divided by half
I had a dream I was greatest of all time
Sipping on shit older than me
I'm living life like a found a fucking check
Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I'm lit
I swear I've been through everything in life but a coffin
And my middle name Michael ho
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it's cool because I got the title ho
See I just want my fantasies in real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like
They give the wrong people more airtime than airlines
If not you feel my energy
Don't feel bad cause honestly all the times that I had
Those will be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Let's reminisce over the good times and the bad
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set till you considered great
How many missed calls till you considered fake
How many dreams till it's considered fate
I'm eating in a World where I'm considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
My best friend got addicted to pills
Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those be the best memories...
Let's reminisce over the good times and the bad
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
Seemed like yesterday I just seen him smile and laugh
I'm stressing over little shit
When I should be happy I can
And with my Mama looking at cribs that we can't purchase
Houses bigger than a palace
But they just hurdles
Fast forward a few years later
Now we the fucking winner's circle
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom
But I already dreamed it
So it felt like I rehearsed it
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed
Sad I used to steal Twenty Dollar bills right out her purses
Let's reminisce over the good times and the bad
Reflect on everything we missed
And I wish that this could last forever
But maybe one night is even better
All the people plotted with
Now I'm in the building like two planes bitch
Sleep with the sun up like I grew fangs bitch
I just turn all my nightmares into wet dreams
Saw me on the web like I had a extra six legs
With a bitch with highlights
Well that's all that we do
You be up in the club
I be up in the clouds
Truthfully I want this shit to last a lifetime
I always knew that I would be the man
Oh shit I'm finally famous
I wanna break you off like right now
Come have the time of your life right now
All you gotta do is close your eyes right now
Only culture games and practice
And I feel like the right time
Twisting up my fingers
Oh shit I'm finally famous
I wanna break you off like right now
That Detroit player on top of the world
Detroit players on top of your girl
It's been a hell of a night
What a beautiful life...
What a beautiful life...
That's why we should get gone right now
I'm trying to get you home right now
I bet I could turn you on right now
Really I can't call it
And parties into an alcoholic
And money turned me into a workaholic
Do it like you do it when you do it with your man
So here go the drink you've been waiting all life for
Oh shit I'm finally famous
Feeling like I got the cheat code to life
Cause in my 23 years I done lived a couple lives
I'm way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd
I'd rather die with a smile instead
I'm just multiplying the money and dividing the legs
But I'm never dividing the bread
Regret it like half the hoes I smashed in the sheets
And when it's all said and done I'd probably give her my knee
Man she almost cried when she seen me on TV on BET
Just making it seem easy
And the whole world's seen me
Bitch I know you seen me
Every week is fashion week and every day I'm pressed clean
My life's prom night and guess who the Prom King
They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King
You tell me that wasn't verse of the year
Man that shit deserves a hearse and a tear
All my deals be overpaid and all my joints get over stuffed
So take that check out and owe it up
Man I turned impossible possible
Is that I did everything they told me not to do
They ain't know that was my road to success
Now my picture on the wall hanging to help the kids follow through
Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don't ever wanna come down
Tell me I'm all you need
Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don't ever wanna come down
Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don't ever wanna come down
Tell me I'm all you need
Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don't ever wanna come down
I love shitting on all my exes especially
Let's toast to the interns that made it to CEO
It's crazy when legends are peers and your competition
Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don't ever wanna come down
Tell me I'm all you need
Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don't ever wanna come down
Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don't ever wanna come down
Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don't ever wanna come down
But I just had my face doing a Earl Flinn
Pass it to my man's and them.
If it could take my whole family out to Rio.
Most comfortable behind the Mic's like Tito
LA Reid sign checks right after the contract.
Cause them the times that gave the inspiration at the track meets.
Middle fingers to all of the nonbelievers
From the top they all look the same size
What's the wordy I'm certainly getting rich in a hurry
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Just a bittersweet symphony
Hit the road key of coke in the mantle fold
Triple beam dreams with a trunk full of scattered clothes
Hit it once trust it would make a fat fiend stumble
My new crib got it's own city limit
Motherfucker got his own city in it
Blue marble on the floor
Just a bittersweet symphony
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Just a bittersweet symphony
Walk the mud jungle where they grind it out the leaves
You know what this sounds like
Money counter sound bytes
Colombian necktie over hospital gown white
She live on her knees
I live in a condo in the trees
The air's a little thinner that I breathe
My life is slow motion but the watch screaming freeze
The decoy car is a crash test dummy
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Just a bittersweet symphony
So they could rock a hundred whites
The guests look like a hundred lights
Man when blade died my city cried a hundred nights
But bricks open windows
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Stop... now make that motherfucker hammer time like...
How your waist anorexic and then your ass is colossal
Drop that ass make it boomerang
Fuck that you gonna get some dick today
I walk in with my crew and I'm breaking they necks
I'm looking all good I'm making her wet
They pay me respect they pay me in checks
And if she look good she pay me in sex
You the best you deserve a crown bitch
Stop... now make that motherfucker hammer time like...
Somebody point me to the best ass eater
Only time you on the net is when you Google my ass
Nothing is stopping you
Nothing is stopping you
Nothing is stopping you
Nothing is stopping you
Parents always tried to keep me home
I had it on my jacket way back in high school
Know I wanted to be in them night clubs and not all off in that night school
I woke up early on a Saturday
I didn't even have no gas but somehow God just lead me to it
When I heard the songs he was doing
Then I hopped up on that red eye when I finished
But fuck it I'm on a mission
I know the Program Director hot
But I spit a freestyle up in there so cold
You gotta make time when it's time for karma to come back around
I'm even working half days on my day off bitch
Bitch I need that fucking fire
Can do anything in the world except not do it
Would drive me to school every single chance he had
And gave me the talks that made me to a man
Not everybody got a dad but they got a Uncle Sam
And he ain't came around till I made a 100 grand
Even though you deserved a commission plus mo
The grandma sad when she saw my commercial
It's never ever been to late
I know it's been a long time
It's never ever been to late
It's never ever been to late
To do what you wanna do
I woke up working like a Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline
All this bread can't be good for my cholesterol
Dodging every bullet and venereal
If you focus on what's in front of you and not what's in the peripheral
Drama on drama over comma on comma
I woke up working like a Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline
I got 3 jobs like I'm Jamaican though
I need 3 wives like I was Haitian though
They say Detroit going through the great depression
Still it's been depressed so long I can't even tell depression here
I woke up working like a Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Getting paid like we seventy
Float around my town like it's the motherfucking seven seas
I got money coming through
Drugs and women coming too
Got my family living comfortable
Got me thinking I'm doing what I'm supposed to do
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do
Getting paid like we seventy
You know what you see
And get fucked up like we was out of town
Red cup yeah that college shit
Free liquor got it on scholarship
Bitch act like you don't know what's up
Act like it ain't my crew blowing up
It's just a feeling inside me
It's just a feeling inside me
When you get in the game I swear the whole world commentates you
I must be doing something right if every mill comes with a spare I guess
You don't know what you do
It's just a feeling inside me
It's just a feeling inside me
Can't let that high go to waste I feel high on
When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Praying to a sky all black
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
Cause you take anything and just make it everything
One time don't change everything
She's still insane and now she's saying
When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
Now they problems he got to deal with
When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
And you already know you're too fly
You know they never like it when you never say never
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Last time calling me crazy
Last time calling me crazy
Who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose
BIG was the first one that had it
Used to pick me up from school right after work
Now she rolling up in that Caddy like she coming to church
Used to have to take showers standing in the mildew
Feeling like I got my first chain
BIG was the first one that had it
Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits
What's the noise all about with this rap stuff
Feeling like I got my first chain
BIG was the first one that had it
I done gave my city drive all the roads I paved
No matter what way I turn things go my way
Stack bills on bills till my backyards got pools on pools
Off this asparagus and bread and pasta
But remember my first ass and the first time she came
It almost felt as good as when I got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
About two months in a week's time
So fuck whoever has a bad thought don't know the god
Got some drinks and some motherfucking refer blowing
I tell her fuck with me and you could be something
Yo girl so bad I want the threesome
Threesome trying to have a threesome
Threesome trying to have a threesome
Fuck with me and you could be something
I believe in God and rubbers
Even if we sex you are not my lover
Hit you on the couch and not the covers
And if you bring you friend then we got to fuck her
And if I answer this phone call don't make a sound ho
My life is my audacity my dogs to the right of me
I got the girl you can't lay a finger on right here massaging me
But this the life I made though
I show a bad bitch what she made for
Got some drinks and some motherfucking refer blowing
I tell her fuck with me and you could be something
Yo girl so bad I want the threesome
Threesome trying to have a threesome
Threesome trying to have a threesome
Fuck with me and you could be something
I'm eating lobster with my shrimp hand
Feeling on her with my pimp hand
I'm talking to her like her Daddy do
And bet she give me everything but attitude
Twist my fingers up and rep my avenue
You cuff your wife like I want that
When I got freaky women tongue kissing
Marijuana lung lifting
Give long dick then I'm long distance
Face in my lap nose dancing
Got some drinks and some motherfucking refer blowing
I tell her fuck with me and you could be something
Yo girl so bad I want the threesome
Threesome trying to have a threesome
Threesome trying to have a threesome
Fuck with me and you could be something
I believe in God and rubbers
Even if we sex you are not my lover
Hit you on the couch and not the covers
My pussy almost jump out my drawers ooh shit
Ooh I wanna ride this big pig
Ooh I wanna put the dogs on the head of this good motherfucker
Ooh now look at here baby
And a dick like that will make any pussy excited
Up in the keyhole straight spying
You the only reason me and your mama ain't together
She's so much better than my old bitch
Hell yeah I'm unemployed
Baby daddy down my back
I heard it's big and it's long
This where your dick belong
Get a crack valve with that bass in it
If I got weed then I'm lacing it
I got yo mama all in my line
Throw a hundred every time
I think my coupe just lost its mind
Last ten years I've been on tour
And I still got that old money
I touch more green than a lawnmower
I'm on my tour bus fucking mamas getting paid up
I take that bitch to my mansion
My pockets stuffed with dough
I made it all in the streets
She tell me she love me
I'm everything that she want
Lobster butter basted
So let's sex on the beach
She tell me she love me
I'm everything that she want
Just might win an award if that shit hit the net
She tell me she love me
I'm everything that she want
I done fell asleep fucking last night
Put the city on let's get it
Put the city on let's get it
Ride through the hood day
Ride through the hood where I would stay
I told my mom and my dad it'll be the last Christmas
In the hood that you can visit
Cause the best mixed with Hennessey is problems
I took that advice young when I was headed up to college
Momma swimming in that debt
Rather swim with the piranhas or the shark
Getting rich ain't a blessing it's a choice
Drunk and still drinking out the bottle
You ain't alive if you ain't living that's the motto
Put the city on let's get it
Put the city on let's get it
No yoga boy I was making blow stretch
Stash looking healthy but my jewelry got the flu though
Put the city on let's get it
Thriving neighborhoods are now vacant
Going from a population of nearly 2 million
To under 700,000 in a matter of years
That's how it's supposed to be
Long as you've been knowing me
And that's how it's supposed to be
Is what not to say at this time
Only palm trees I got is this weed off in my hand
And all the stress is all propane
Hoping I could make her smile
That's how it's supposed to be
Long as you've been knowing me
And that's how it's supposed to be
Got less miles on it than I do friends
Remember when we laid at you and Paige's crib
Best thing bout being broke is you don't spend shit
Ironically those were the times I felt the richest
All those times that we spent by the pool girl
Was too broke to even take you to the zoo girl
Maybe its because I had you girl
Was thinking about when we went to London and Paris
And gave each other times that we cherished
Remember when you saw the Eiffel Tower
Man I hate to see you single in the club looking for kisses and hugs
Sorry for when you had to cry yourself to sleep
Tried to count on me and I made you count sheep
Yeah I know you're not supposed to have cake and eat too
Crazy how these hoes always kept my plate full
And ain't came back since
That's about the time that you left for the city
I know I wasn't honest to ya girl
Almost broke every promise to ya girl
Brought problems to your world
I was scared you'd find somebody who would treat you like you supposed to
Young and living reckless
I can't imagine myself without you
I need a whole lot of help without you
Me and my granny both agreed
It's crazy how they think you got it all figured out
Just because your bank account gets all figured out
Next time somebody try and tell you how to run your shit
And they ain't major shit
I always say long days is better than long nights
At least in the day you've got shade
I used to think there's no such things as wrong rights
Till my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries
But I didn't know it was off of infested streets
Now he the reason I've got to walk with my little niece to go eat
I guess that's the hunger that got me out
And the girl I've wanted since ninth grade trying to route
That was back when I was seventeen
It's crazy how much that you can see with your eyes closed
Or how you could have everything
And still think about everything missing
Like I probably remember the times I missed out on
More than the ones I lived
I probably remember the girls that I ain't have
More than the ones I did
Smoke so much I need two lighters
I wake up and treat the day like stack history month
Somewhere in the club probably all liquored out
That I still ain't got it all figured out
Even when your bank account is all figured out
Even when your bank account gets all figured out
Even when it... all of it... when you still ain't got...
Today I woke up and realized every day gets shorter
Age is nothing but a reminder and it doesn't tell you
How old or young minded someone is
But each have our own finish line
Better to be in the hall of fame than shame
Whether it exists for what you do or not
We create this world so we make what exists
And remembered for all the right reasons
So when it's so late that it's early
And you need a drink even though the bar's closed
Remember why you do what you do
The adrenaline rush of creating what you think about
The joy of looking back and saying that you did it
I'm with my shooter and a preacher hallelujah
When they view ya fucking around
Busting them bottles and fucking your bitches
I can see a bad bitch from far away
You put your rims on and you think that you're balling
Fuck with me get a room for daisies on the dirt
From barely managing to mansions
I got a couple marbles missing I know
Now there's marbles all on the floor
But I don't reply cause that's the clearest way to send a message
Paper running through my jugular
Came in this motherfucker by myself
When you were fifteen you were yelling
Everyday that I wake I say grace
I need to ball with a chain
I got a real bad bitch I haven't seen her in a month
With twins so big she can put it in her ugh
Ooh I love it when she drop it and spread it like
When I see her camel all I wanna do hump
From the motor city and been have drive
I just need a little gas in my engine
Power of the revenue got me a 2 to 10 and a 10 to 2
Stacking money face to face what that mean CPR
D Town I ride around me and my dog like Charlie Brown
Seen Money all switch up
When the days get dimmer
This is for the ones that's always riding with ya ain't switched
I think it's time to kill it
I said I think its time to kill it
Ain't anybody fucking with my clique
I be fresher than these motherfuckers head to toe
And I'm with the same crew till I'm an old man
Cause there no such thing as new old friends
Seen Money all switch up
When the days get dimmer
This is for the ones that's always riding with ya ain't switched
I think it's time to kill it
I said I think its time to kill it
Then I woke up in a city where the population match the death toll
I guess it took ten years for me to be an overnight success
Two girls is breast to breast to breast to breast
Blowing smoke but I'm a breath of fresh air
Taking double shots like Siamese
I knew I lived this life back when I was young and used to climb trees
And I don't owe nobody in the world no favors
I be thinking about becoming a cop
Was talking to my dad though on some other shit
I'm into risk and taking it
I'm into making it then back then make it like I ain't made it yet
But I've been working on myself and that's the most important work
Even if you don't get paid for it
I started rapping Biggie Smalls in the basement
I mean whatever it's worth
I give whatever I'm worth
Yeah whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life man that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father forgive me these are all my confessions
Man this wasn't luck it was destined
Who flip like confetti and then when you back they back to call you dog
Man this why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty
I don't know what I would do without it
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
You gotta come to my side and see how we live
My grandma just died I'm the man of the house
I guess when your stars align you do like the solar system and plan it out
Yeah I'm not invested but you can't attest it
I pay my mortgage and electric
Try and blow my cake just know that's a death wish
You tore the game apart who put it back together
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
We can go back and forth all day
Your house got another house
We bout to tear this whole place up pretty much
And you know it's all your fault
You know it's all your fault
Ho we done made it through hell and disaster
Headed home to the D where you know I keep a Gina
I'm the good with the evil
Fuck you nice to meet you
You can have a peace sign man without the middle finger
That's my family tree
And I can't cut them off even with diabetes
Hit the beat and kerosene it
A 100 dollar fade every single time you see us
Piece of pizza with Tanisha
And you know it's all your fault
You know it's all your fault
Ho you gotta move quick
Till everything I spit is all timeless
Bitch no maybe ho I gotta make it
I don't fuck with you
Bitch I don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
Bitch I got no feelings to go
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name
And I'm gonna text your ass back like
I don't fuck with you
Bitch I don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
Got a million things on my mind
You might be able to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
I make a bitch stand outside forever like the Statue of Liberty
I don't fuck with you
Bitch I don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank a lot for
Yeah I got a lot but want a lot more
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
I'm the one that you dodge with
I'm the one you need alone
I'll take that flight alone earlier in the day for ya
And I ain't bout to play no games with you
You don't ever see the big picture
I want you to take me serious
Tell me who you wanna fucking love
I left that sexy dress out on the bed with a note there laying for ya
With directions where I'm waiting with dinner and waiter for ya
Then you back that ass up on me like it's 99
I'd probably rob a fucking bank and go to jail for ya
As long as I can smack that ass and pull that hair for ya
And I ain't bout to play no games with you
You don't ever see the big picture
I want you to take me serious
I've been waiting on that ass all night though
And I ain't bout to play no games with you
You don't ever see the big picture
I want you to take me serious
I always wanted to stunt so hard
I always wanted to ride that whip
I always wanted to fuck that bitch
I always wanted to live this life
I always wanted to wear that ice
I always wanted paradise
I always wanted paradise
I'm addicted to a lot of crazy shit
Got a pretty young girl look like Janet on me
She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers
Till we crash up the whole database
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base
And I'll never take that shit for granted
Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances
Even if I was the captain of Titanic
Making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
Now I'm in court for some shit I didn't do
So when it's time to travel management say I only need to
Lately though my family been too happy
I been signed for four years and I'm just able to do that
We supposed to be the role models
No wonder why she wanna smoke weed and skip college
Real life will teach your ass way fucking fast
I always thought my last girl was supposed to be my last
I don't even have time for everything in my head
On my way to see Kim and Ye both tie the knot
My whole squad in this bitch
I mix that shit with champagne
My whole squad in this bitch
I mix that shit with champagne
Bad bad bad bitches they dressed up
Like it's the NBA draft day and I bet
And I bet that she ain't gonna be that late
For a young sexy face like me
A young young young sexy face like me
She like girls if she don't like me
Sexy young thing I might have to ID her
Ooh damn I got some Ideas
Older women be like damn your mature
I say you the one but God damn I got nerve
My whole squad in this bitch
I mix that shit with champagne
My whole squad in this bitch
I mix that shit with champagne
I might even speak Italian
50 women in the room like we ain't even got a lobby
With a billion dollar pussy
But you know them crackers ain't gonna let you get the Ritz
They ain't gonna let you get the fountain in the front with the fist
Bitch do it so big you can't escape that shit
My whole squad in this bitch
I mix that shit with champagne
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Whatever happened just had to happen
Dancing like it's something to believe in
The harder your heart keep beating
Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
You need to be taken care of and pampered
I know you've been silencing your phone
I know you feel like sometimes that y'all don't speak the same language
I know that you just wanna let it go with all the bitches that you came with
Baby let me be your vacation
Baby I am just saying
Take a load off on my private island
Come inside and go into hiding
I know that you've been sacrificing your time
And need time to unwind and let go
So let go and let's go and let's roll and we roll
So many charges on my card oh God I think I got indicted
We can shoot up by the town
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested
Where they might know us off any intersection
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it
Know you're tired of arguing
But no screaming and shouting
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college
Like they not hundreds and thousands
Which your may think that shit insane
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Whatever happened just had to happen
I know it look like like you need a vacation
Don't forget the make up
I wonder if I fell from the sky
Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
Man I swear to god it get so deep though
That sometimes I just gotta wake my ass up out my sleep though
And the girl I gave it all up for ain't love me for me though
See I got a stack of problems that could use a fucking steamroll
Got off in the game don't need no cheat code
As long as I know the G code
Being paranoid ain't turn me to a creep
You ain't got that metal on your side
Deeper than your sister dying and you're telling your nieces
But pressure make diamonds
My opponent probably praying for postponement
You fuck with the best rapper don't even know it
It's written in the stars man the sky is the author
I pulled the sword out of the stone I'm King Arthur
I wonder if I fell from the sky
Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
Then I blow the candles out on my K
I talk that cash money shit
Jail time a slap on the wrist
Cut your head off get it mailed out stamp on your lips
You can tell I'm grinding by my wrist
Well tell them I'll be waiting in suspense
And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say
That shit enough times like somebody rewind me
Well let me throw up mine and also let me show this vision of mine
And if getting your point across crosses the line
And ain't nobody if they remember you they remember rap
We come empty pockets before we have empty pockets slime
I wonder if I fell from the sky
Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
And when you get it all just remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world
Imagine this so much some nights it felt like that I had it
Used to look up at the stars and be like ain't too much that's different
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
And when you get it all just remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world
My grandma told me if you write your name in stone you'll never get the white out
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions that I couldn't survive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black you had to extra extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
All my life you've been that angel in disguise saying
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
And when you get it all just remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world
It's all good I love you grandma
You know I had to cop that mansion on the hill and pool that
She talk so much that she done fucking made my dick soft
I guess women are sometimes like a jigsaw
Sometimes I just shut up and let my wrist talk
I just hope that's not the only single thing that's going through em
Headed to the game for okay seats
I be in and out of cars like a fucking crash dummy
White people with a black son
Went from standing in court to starting up a corporation
Went so hard last night that we made the morning paper
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change
But damn in high school you had the fattest ass
Reminiscing on the one time we smashed in the back of the whip
And you gave me that head
I swear to God that was the best night of my life
I know at first it was a little bit embarrassing yeah
But 5 minutes later you on my lap
You're telling me how you went down South for school
But you know business majors
A new scenery might just be inspiring
Okay I came up how I came up
A little change bring change up
A little fame bring famous
A little danger now I'm dangerous
Laying low cause it won't fade us
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change
The she turned around said
Seeing the houses on the hills like I'm deserving this shit
Oh boy I'm worth it yeah it's time to put the work in this shit
And I got a crib off in the same hills we used to drive in
Okay I came up how I came up
A little change bring change up
A little fame bring famous
A little danger now I'm dangerous
Laying low cause it won't fade us
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it
These hoes be doing research
You just misunderstood though
Through all the evil in your eyes I can still see the good though
I'm on my way to halfway baby I need you to meet me
Then I got my first European you took that key then you keyed it
These hoes be doing research
I swear she like this piece of hair off in the sink
You hang around too God damn long it's like you need work
I hope my eyes the one that's lying to me girl and not you
We all got a past but there's shit that I can't pass
When I don't it make me feel like I don't know your ass
These hoes be doing research
I swear she like this piece of hair off in the sink
You hang around too God damn long it's like you need work
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I'm never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
God talk to me in silence
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
I done did everything except worry
I knew that this life was meant for me
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Or get stomped out with ten feet
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
From where they need a handout
But they tell you put hands up
Only deals I have is from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins
Though you know what I came for
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel
That's my new lifetime policy
Watch what we visualize on the rise
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see before you pass
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
A banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
I ain't passing out until I'm asthma attacking
I take a plan and then I back to back it
Got a little time and a lot of talent
Do a little talking and a lot of action
Packed out but I can count on my hands
Girls from law school in this bitch
I just had a couple dots that need connecting
Now your top 5 getting redirected
From here on out it'll be consecutive
Moving like Channing Tatum
I got this bitch going off more than breaking and entering
I make the shit that last for infinity
Don't test the agility
I gave my whole family jobs and I take care of my mom
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
And my family live that life
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
As I look up to the sky
I thought about a 100 things to do before I die
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
All the wrong people you a price tag
Now you pray to god hoping that you got a Christ tag
Taking elevators straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
And my family live that life
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
As I look up to the sky
I thought about a 100 things to do before I die
Just don't let me die
I go extra hard at the first second you doubt me
I strive for perfection at the same time
I'm accepting the fact that there'll never be nothing perfect about me
5 years ago I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
And my family live that life
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
As I look up to the sky
I thought about a 100 things to do before I die
I gotta do something that's innovative
Creative just to create a legacy before death do us part
I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt the youth
So before you scrutinize how I feel ask god if those polls important
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
And my family live that life
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
As I look up to the sky
And being broke as some weak shit.
Or something nice I don't wanna eat shit.
And I fell victim to the vagina.
No thank you rather run in the cash race.
The only thing getter better in time besides wine.
I do it with a passion.
I'll tell y'all what I'm about though.
Man I've been writing songs for a many.
Yous to tell by his cream.
Call that bitch a ice t.
And make my mama proud that she didn't get that abortion.
Tried to write a love song
I wanted it to be just right
Tried to make it beautiful
But all I could think of was our last fight
I was going to play it on piano
Have the drums come in real bold
But I couldn't think of anything good to say
So the big ballot strings will never get played
Piece of paper I started with I threw away
A song about our love will never see the light of day
Cause you made it that way
I was gonna write you a love song
But you screwed it all up
I almost wrote you a love song
She threw my watch out the window
She running threw the crib finding anything she can
Every time we fall out ill throw yo ass out but you just end up boomeranging back to me. what the fuck
I was gonna write you a love song
But you screwed it all up
I almost wrote you a love song
Ooh yeah you made it that way
I can't tell if she's if down or not
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Are we gonna fuck or not
I can't tell if she's if down or not
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Are we gonna fuck or not
I'm on that up up excellent
28 but I make her feel like she's 19
But I send her home in my white tee
I can't tell if she's if down or not
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Now every time I see this girl
She be asking all type of shit
Where is it I'm going to
And who is it I'm hanging with
Can't never tell is she in to me
Or just wanna be a friend with me
Mixed signal she sending me
Without being inconspicuous
Don't be so ambiguous girl
I can't tell if she's if down or not
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Don't you big poppa me
I'm a little off like a touch up
And I got weed that'll cough your lungs up
If I die bury me inside that Louis store
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
We like Snoop and Dre
You deserve a coupe today
Bad enough to skip the line but to me she just a nine
Bitch I am a monster I belong on district 9
I get all the eyes when I step inside and
And a couple cool bitches
Yeah I kick my feet up you can't say that I ain't home
Gone and roll that weed yeah I think its time to spark it
My cousin finished school can't believe he graduated
Threw him 20,000 dollars told his ass congratulations
But I could probably hire him and who all paid for his shit
I got white was serving that I been to jail I ain't going back
Freaky bitches love the money I make
And to live like this you motherfuckers gotta pay
So let that shit burn
Bitch I had one shot and I ain't blow it
Riding till the wheels fall off and they tow it
I got green on top of green damn its looking like I grow it
Burn bitch I let it burn bitch
My money straighter than a motherfucking perm bitch
Shorty give me all that brain still ain't never learned shit
She naked in my studio I'm on that Howard Stern shit
Hit your girl in my whip and now that pussy got the new car smell
Same shit different day I ain't broke no more it's a different day
And God damn you all crazy ass
Wanna smash my Mercedes ass
Skip the jewelry store and grab rocks
But before you hit that Alter
Gave her half your heart but she got half of your amount
So take that into account
I swear I goes to work on that pussy like she paid me to
She get it from her mama
I know I should leave her
Alarm clock said I'm too late
And they said I'm too weak I could use a few weights
So they said I took too long and don't look too strong
Now it's displayed in my wordplays
I know I'm dope man but I can't move crack
But I try and bring it back before your brain hit the pan
But both of our chains say made in Japan
German engineers designed both of the Sedans
I want all these snapped in it's back in the day
I need that whip clean G
Supposed to be headed downtown
Roll the window back up
Where you get banged on if you in it or not
To make it out my hood is like to make it out of jail
Fuck around and I might bring back gators
Everyday I leave the crib with no money
They trying to stop my shine
Less you doing a deal with
Whoa there. Whoa there
I'm who everybody know here
I come through in the club and get more money than promoters
I be off in the hood I bet you don't ever go there
Its people you don't know there boy
And my bitches be gorgeous boy
Bring it back to the kitchen
Then bring it back when its finished
Know I'll blast if you tempt him
Unload it faster than Vick's concrete school craft to the the sick
I'm about to take a break and get away on a vacation
Change my name to Navajo and live alone and only blow weed
Don't nobody ever know you
Word to yo daddy leather sandals
Either pay the light bill or light up them candles
Break that bitch down and peel of the first layer
My stoner chicks gather round soon as I break the jar out
I got a dream that's worth more then my reality. And pride that's worth more then a salary.
And a text from the girl I love I stopped calling
Quote I hope its worth all it.
There's no need to save I could get change off the street next to the meter maid.
You don't understand man I came from nothing. This is what I dreamed about. This is what we dreamed about.
Try to fuck with paper planes but it's not the same high
If you say it take away from taste then get some better smoke
Ain't no middle man everything you need is in stock
I be so clean diesel overpowers my cologne
Fuck a dime set lets cop a quarter pound
What the fuck is you gonna put down
Fuck you want this a raw paper
Fake weed too much makeup clown
Get real smoking green strawberry fields
Now they just stuck from smoking with us
Now hop up on the rainbow try to reach where I hang though
I'm a little further up then and near the angels
So at your highest point you still wouldn't reach my ankles
And the people show love like a bear hug
Fair enough I stand behind my balls like a felon does
You beat around the bush like four play
Then I'm in the next city like a tour date
There ain't no I in team but it's an I in win
Ain't no I in lose but there's an I in him
Perform so well I might as well take a bow
People wanna know how if feels in the clouds
Where I roam like a phone in the unknown zone
And we condone a tone a money hoes and clothes
And my record sell like a boat load
I should beat them like pro tools
For some cold ass ice cream
The fabric on my ass is satin and its sad n
You think you could afford this fabric
When it comes to the hoes all the man like shaft this
Atheists turn Christian when I rock my True Religions
In the booth I use the restroom
Its slaughter ever since the day I opened up that midnight marauders
Come and make an observation
All my money counted all my rubbers skin tight
Me I always stood out you was more the in type
I never follow suits you was more like pin stripes
Well isn't it ironic that I'm in a big body
Root for the same team
Thing yeah I just tend to see the same thing they say its meant to be when you sleep to the same dream
West side east side south side north side
The city the city I like it in the city
Six mile seven mile eight mile
Charmers east side ya know
East side what up though
They lay it on the line
Make sure you don't get file up
Hammer in and out of court
For them whole and half stacks
Trying to make at least half back
They hearts drop when they see me on tall monitors
Blasting my city that's yo ass in my city
Need a pass in my city
I know I run my city because I'm there to see it
It's hard being a citizen settling up in Michigan
And the DJ playing my song
I pray that it ain't temporary
I've seen it in my dreams though
Mr Visionary and I told them what it is though
And we gonna be the ones on TV
And we gonna be the ones on TV
When you living out your dreams sleep's an interruption
We ain't no bed or a lie but we made up
While they was all sleeping later we stayed up
And the name across it is my own
Who would've known that we'd be paid off this musical grind
Unusual I'm me and my beautiful mind
I Don't Think They Want It
I Don't Think They Want It
Soon as I walk in all the bad bitches on it
I walk up in this bitch looking like a light show
Got a team but I'm by myself ISO
I Don't Think They Want It
Your girls on my dick and she trying to sit up on it
She hopped on my lap even took a pick up on it
I Don't Think They Want It
Brand new whip but I push it like it's stolen
I'm headed to the top bitch and I don't think you going
I Don't Think They Want It
I Don't Think They Want It
You could tell I stepped out
I saw your girlfriend only from the chest down
I'm so dressed up but I pull her dress down
I Don't Think They Want It
Send it all around the World so I don't even want it
I Don't Think They Want It
Getting music so the drinks the only thing that's pouring
Damn that's what I like and it feel good
I Don't Think They Want It
I Don't Think They Want It
You need her at the alter now that is just embarrassing
I just walk up in this bitch higher than a carry on
I Don't Think They Want It
I Don't Think They Want It
If you really wanna talk about Good
But I do it for the life
I rise more than juries this is my story
And hell yeah I'm going for the title
I'm going when it's dark out
And my shadow is the only thing I'm fearing
If I need to see my idol I just look up in the mirror
So I took impossible and turned it into optical
See plus is like tears in the locker room
But you should take a look at where it got us to
A walking itch in my gym suit
Life's a love song so dedicate it to the paper
Said that I've been with
I'm so old school but the flow newfangled
Shit real but you got no chance
And all of his history lessons
I'm passing blunts in the bathroom
We carving out the classics
I'm harder than you and you and you and you
Would you compare me to you
If you think we're equal
Then bitch you are remedial
Remember who you're speaking to
Soon as I approach in
Please do not approach him
Please try and test us
And you already know where I live
How could I make it out that bitch being a bitch
Better stack I'll make your bitch come over
See to you I'm Mr. Big but to him I'm Mr. Bush
I promise we gone live how we want
I promise we gone get all we want
Remember way back when we gone say back then
We'll be the ones that will have arenas packed in
I'm finally famous till the lights is faded then the crowd is jaded when I hop on stages
Man I wish that this could last for life
I promise they gone all try and be me
I promise they gone know who we are
I promise we that gone be successful with or without the college degree
When we get it right look back and say that we did it right and hope it lasts for life
Man I wish that this could last for life
Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single
You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb
And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
Oh I could let you down
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
Thank God I'm with my girl
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
Thank God I'm with my girl
Or even change my palate and fuck with salad
Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump
Never got head while flaming up the blunt
Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer
And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair
Ain't a single living thing that likes living single
Oh I could let you down
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
Thank God I'm with my girl
You know it right if she ain't by my side
Thank God I'm with my girl
To the one girl guys who claim they don't need more
You probably never got tested and have that type of clarity
I'd rather live my life with that lifetime guarantee
But I'm down to hear the stories about what your hoes do
It's probably more entertaining than me talking about my wife down in Whole Foods
Or how I'm with her I feel whole too
Even though he's on target with everything I've been missing
And I'm the reason we ain't make it work
That's what makes it worse
Oh I could let you down
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
Thank God I'm with my girl
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
And I'm love with your smell and your smile
That means queen seems I known you for the longest
Just know I love you every time you hear me through them speakers
I need you here with me
And I'm love with your smell and your smile
Id put you first so you deserve my last name
You make my worst days feel like my birthday
If we never happen we'll regret it in the worst way
And I'm in love with your smell and your smile
Only got yourself to blame
I remember when you hated ooh
Now you tell me take my time
How bout I just take your city make that motherfucker mine
I'm a underground king hoe
The game ain't always fair and that's the thing though
You can play your heart out everyone don't get a ring though
You are in the presence of a champion
Bout to get a condo that I can fit your mansion in
You ain't figured out I am the reason that she canceling
I be at the parties where you stuck outside and can't come in
What's on the news trick
And guess what it's true bitch
I feel like we made it
But we ain't made enough
You would've thought we made it up
Man I was made to be greater
Used to ride escorts now I get escorted
Who got up on my nerves so I had to platonic her
No that ain't my girl but every leader needs a Monica
I want the baddest chick to treat my stick like a thermometer
I'm who your girlfriend acting like she ain't shit over
Was made for that Mick Jagger shit
Baggage check and a chick
Bitch I'm living everyday month yearly
Yell until you motherfuckers hear me
I feel like we made it
But we ain't made enough
You would've thought we made it up
Man I was made to be greater
Yeah this was meant to be
I came in the world knowing nothing was for free
To tell her friend to tell a hoe
I have been the realest since the doc cut umbilical
Stack it stack it stack it up some more
Give me everything I want then I'm asking for some more
Rainbow chain on my necklace look like a pot of gold
They tell me I'm the best and I ain't even trying hoe
See me I'm into hoes that's into hoes
And I be shining neck to wrist
And your girl want mouth to mouth
Used to tell me everything I want be
But somehow I just turn the tide like laundry
Look and I remain until my funeral
Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I'm lit
So go head and light it
I swear I've been through everything in life but a coffin
And my middle name Michael hoe
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it's because I got the title hoe
See I just want my fantasies and real life
You got everything to me what it feel like
If not you feel my energy
Those will be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set before you considered great
How many missed calls before you considered fake
How many dreams before its considered fate
I'm eating in a World where I'm considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
My best friend got addicted to pills
I got tired of my living
It take a man with a wooden
Then the police sirens are wrong.
They took what they saw then went out the back door.
Looked on the floor saw blood by the pool.
So I asked the clerk dude what's the trouble.
But his face seemed puzzled.
I walked towards the huddle to the front of the crowd...
Man I couldn't even kiss my mother.
In this life time you need to run and get left
Bitch I'm on a money making marathon welcome to the terror dome journey to my life
Where my fire freaks that's gonna ride with me
Where my fire freaks that's gonna ride with me
Shooting up your phantom night and call your shit the holy ghost
And protect me from the hoes if their life ain't sweet they go desert me
Shut the fuck up and stand out when you see me like I'm the verdict
Charge your ass a fuck you fee and make you pay your tax today

And for you fucking haters who don't like it I can't see you past the way haters the flaps of my eye lids
So tell tell me who the freshest of them of them all I step inside my closet and that shit look like a loft

We play paint ball we play eight ball
On the great wall in my closet
Now you seen all my closet
You don't gotta go home but get the hell out my closet
You talking to the king of fresh what the fuck is you saying
I gotta put that patch over my third eye slick rick
Don't make my goons go stupid
Don't make my goons go stupid
My girls and cars both skirt off
I like a pussy that's so wet that I can surf off
Don't make my goons go stupid
Don't make my goons go stupid
Bump with so much bass
I don't love them hoes
Put your hands beneath earth
Don't make my goons go stupid
Don't make my goons go stupid
Got your sister dancing out the condo in a tutu
If she addicted to what my dick did
Don't make my goons go stupid
Yeah you got that body of a Goddess
You don't got no competition you got it
You don't got no competition you got it
From the front looking like she got some ass probably
Lotta chicks off in this club and you the baddest in this bitch
The club owner should pay you whenever you make an appearance
Grown as hell I don't care to choose
To tell the truth I'm a tear the roof
Out that motherfucker nail it too
Now you the baddest that I've seen in the club all night
Love how you moving over there but I really want you closer
Wake up and if it's up we'll do it like there's no tomorrow
She call me when she need it
And I'm a come running to feed that appetite I do it anyway she want it
She want to throw bands on her pole dance
She want to stunt with me on her old man
And you OD on my life files
Work it like a girl should
Tell the DJ bring it back
Tell your man he ain't getting it back

Million dollar babies plus alimony

Thirteen cars I don't need nothing else

I wake up to pussy and cantaloupe
Then she made me fuck my appetite

Like its corn on the cob
And my broad is so bad I can't hit from the back
Finally Famous she throw this set up
Like Sororities and Frats

Straight up out of med school

I got my left hand on that booty
They should put me on a poster
They should put me on a poster
Every night I get it all
They should put me on a poster
Yeah the game barely started but its already over
I bet you could not walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can
I bet you could not walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can
I'm so far ahead that I could pause and take pictures
Doing everything in the world that I planned
They should put me on a poster
They should put me on a poster
Every night I get it all
They should put me on a poster
Yeah the game just started but its already over
I bet you could not walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can
I said I bet you can't walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can
Yeah I took your girlfriend and turned her into my mascot
Hometown hero but I'll never pull my mask out
Sometimes your first shot could be your last shot
Just see what I do when the ball get passed out
So I'm the one they stand and applaud for
Bet everybody call me Big
They should put me on a poster
They should put me on a poster
Every night I get it all
They should put me on a poster
Yeah the game just started but its already over
I bet you could not walk where I ran
Ass shake ass shake yeah I like that ass shake
She on that superman blue and red cop car
And I can't feel shit but my dick in yo bitch
So guess what there's only one thing left to pop off
She step in its hard to call her man and say she just at home
If that casket ain't 24 karat gold when I die
Then I ain't made enough fucking money man and that's real talk
This my roll weed time
Don't turn it into dead in the street time
Her legs do the peace sign
Know the hood so well don't need street signs
Young rich and iconic
One time for my hood till I go in the ground
And haters look at me like snow in the south
As I hop on this red eye flight with all red eyes
If I go too fast down this road I end up like left eye
I'm wondering would it be better if I left
My girlfriend know I got a fetish for fine hoes
I'm worldwide so she know I'm gonna find hoes
Looking through my call log
It hurts looking at her face to ask her why she crying for
I'm so fresh I'm wondering why I didn't design clothes
This rap shit is something that you gotta be designed for
Turned the radio on and do I hear Sean... no
And treat me like a John Doe
I wish that I could drop my nuts in they're tonsils
And I been signed to Ye for well over a year now
You taught me to create a process
Dog it's me being modest
Put you in the studio
So you could focus more on my shit
And I don't mean to sound selfish
I'm feeling like a crab in a bucket
And it's a dream come true that you signed me
People asking me how it happened
And you already know where to find me
Bitch I connected to the D like Siamese
So if you see me out of town getting money
Know I do it for my city and I be back very promptly
So say what up if you see us
Dick so big I bust a nut for a fetus
Glad to do any interview or dope feature
Waiting on my reply but they never will receive it
You are not half of what I am and can't be it
Recognize a star like you pledge to the allegiance
Honest dog had so many problems dog
Welcome to hell's paradise
I always heard life was a pair of dice
As I'm looking at her smearing eyes
She yelling take them glasses off your eyes are the only things that not lying
Not caring to the point that I stopped lying
I tell her I feel the same
You said you wasn't on no steal your man shit
If I broke it off now we won't be on some friend shit
I broke the levy to your eyes
That I don't give a damn shit
But you should have used your head first
Because two can't be in first place
What was no strings attached got tangled when
Shits way different from us first chilling
Sometimes last words can have the worst ending
Which we could fast forward time and reverse feelings
Is there a warranty for love to return and fix it
Nothing about us feeling right
But she'll be back before the end of the night
But you should have used your head first
Finally got your girl going crazy
I can do it all and it ain't no problem
I turn a straight prude bitch into a nudist
Foolish I be on that new shit
And I'm blowing up like bitches we went to school with
Ain't nobody checking for your garbage
Lot of intuition I ain't even finish college
Never hit the mall and forever get it all
But when you step out why the bitches run out
Double MG shit I put the set down
A million home sellers couldn't find a realer state
Bitch you ain't a boss till you cut a pay check
Only thing between me and your bitch is latex
The two things I don't need are you and my ID
Under twenty five living the fucking life
White America said I'll be doing twenty five to life
Top floor like I'm out tanning
Do it again and I'll see you tomorrow
I buy it but it don't measure up
Under the skin is not so easy to swallow
I'll probably be on mars when I light up
Damn these colors vibrant
I'm going on a trip without the luggage
If the police see I have it
Flash the badge and they'll try to
Got me on my Final Frontier like Captain Kirk Kirk
Not to be on my ball sack
So puff the magic dragon and hop on my flying carpet
Preacher told me I should listen to more Mary Mary
Mary Jane like Peter Parker spot a maid
And I hope she feel the same
Shining you know I'm blinding shit
Won't you know I got a...
I'm from the west side
Baby I'm gone bust it up girl go retard fuck being a gentlemen
I'm a real boss bitch
I got a ... and you know what it is... bring ...
Got big ... in the mother fucker
My money is to infinity
I got the shit you can't ...
Now mama I done grown up too much for you to try to have me babied
I made a little change I can't truly complain
My grandma used to talk about how college was so needed
I'm glad I never listened to y'all and let up
Call the radio and they gonna request us
Even if it's a lie they say everything is great
I know it's just a game to me
I'm just too fake you see
I wish I didn't have to be but watch out
I got too much soul for the world
It's breaking my heart in two
I got too much soul for you
I don't like it but it's true
Known him for forever and he ain't on the same shit
Man I tell him suck my dick then choke on a nut
People want a handle like silver spoons
People want a handle like here you go
I know it's just a game to me
I'm just too fake you see
I wish I didn't have to be but watch out
I got too much soul for the world
It's breaking my heart in two
I got too much soul for you
I don't like it but it's true
Fake it till you make it
They want this or that
Boy gotta hustle like a flip or pack
When I hit the booth I came up with a sick attack
Married to the music so I never give a hand a ring
Yeah and still the game can make you fake like implant
I know it's just a game to me
I'm just too fake you see
I wish I didn't have to be but watch out
I got too much soul for the world
It's breaking my heart in two
I got too much soul for you
Man I wish that I could kill her
I wish that I could still feel her
Now I'm at the club looking for a fill up
Bar tender make sure my drink stay filled up
Man look at this mess I'm in
In my darkest hours I can't see the horizons
But I still remember her sizes
And I'm the man to these broads
Through wall and screaming and audio applause
I'm Mr big shot but you was my star
Hey Juliet I guess our books done huh
You know I ain't book smart
And we could've pick up where we left off
Nothing left to say now
I'll be on my way now
There's nothing left to say now
I'll be on my way now
Man I wish that I could shoot her
I wish that I never knew her
Man what I'm suppose to do huh
She my backbone how I'm suppose to maneuver
But I swear last time was the last time
But now she say it's all past time
And I feel like I see my flat line
And I'm suppose to be a man and all
But when you get that involved
You got to thinking with your head
Man she was suppose to be my baby
Man we was suppose to see our baby
Man I would've gave her everything
I guess we'll never see it now
Nothing left to say now
I'll be on my way now
There's nothing left to say now
I'll be on my way now
Man I wish that I could stab her
Remember when I used to grab her
When I call there's no answer
And she ain't love Big Sean she loves Sean Anderson
Man you could probably feel me dying
And you could probably hear her crying
She killing me from the inside out
Took everything in the crib that was inside out
You want space baby I'll give you all of it
She say whenever I'm here I feel heartless
So it's time to part then
Nothing left to say now
I'll be on my way now
There's nothing left to say now
I'll be on my way now
I say this shit again I said this once before
Well this is mine model chick big behind
Bad enough to skip the line but to me she just a 9
I hop up out that double ooh you can call me Mr. Bond
Bitch I am a monster I belong in district 9
I get all the eyes when I step inside
Horizon just a million people behind me and
And a couple cool bitches
Yeah I kick my feet up you can't say that I ain't home
Wanna long dick I put it in her mouth
And now that bitch look like a cone head
When I'm done gone head
By the time y'all ova here I'm prob ova there
I'm prob in the air no wonder why my mind is
Gone roll that weed yeah I think it's time to spark it
Don't you dare hit that alarm clock I'm laid up
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the lord
So many watches I need eight arms
One neck but got eight charms
Last night ain't go so well
Got kicked up out the hotel
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
Heard she fucked the doorman
Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
I only like green faces
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the lord
They know I'm a dope boy
They don't have no proof
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the lord
It's funny how the trades are
We have the whole city full of bosses
One leader... all the rest y'all follow
Follow me... cradle... trust me
Call me a boss of all bosses
Gets deep with BS on the streets
A few tools used just to get to the top
We still bossy but pine is fine
From the block to the cage
From the label to the stage
It's simply put I'm just ahead of my time
It must the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
Have grease stinking out where you live
You either on my side or in my way
To discuss with the tough that enough is enough
And your dudes in the streets that refuse to be beef
Better move when I reach and get moved with the heat
I launch missiles that ravage ya soft tissue
I salvage with many issues
My marriage is to my pistols
Automatic or revolver
I never follow you cowards
I murder all of you cowards
Your streets are my streets
That's how it's designed
A place where the face I'm not familiar with
They got my back to the wall
I used to have friends
And this is how I must be
The other half will fear me
Shit both halves will make one whole
But nothing can dare those cowards to come near me
I want them cats to feel me
And drag to where your top at
And guaranteed that I dropped that
I'm here to put them rumors to rest
I'm the future in the flesh
I'm the chrome before the storm
I'm the buzz before the storm
I'm the screech before the crash
I'm the click before the blast
I'm the rise before the fall
I'm the loss before the gain
Vacant Lot will keep it hot
And look straight to the heavens so I know that He hear me
When they saw me looked the other way and tried to ignore me
Then they scatter like roaches when they get sprayed with Raid
Better act like you know or get smacked like your hoe
I handle my business and I shoot snitches
That mad scheme to get cream without the job
Let the dead be dark while the Dark is here
Sometimes I will take my brother by the arm
Other times I will take my brother by the shoulder
Then there are times I will take my brother by the neck
Now I done seen the streets turned into a beast with sharp teeth
Put claws in the strong and just devour the weak
I done seen this whole shit change
So sit back and try to visualize if you can
Look at my life... look at how I live
Now I've done seen life play jokes with death as a punchline
Hustlers and killers... they taught me wrong from right
You remember when the kid's dream to get to the top
A generation died at the same time our fathers was born
I've seen a broken home influence a good kid to go bad
And young girls to lose they innocence so fast
And so often the results are so sad
I've watched men beat on my mother my whole life
Dog for life and its on tonight
I can put my life on the line at least one time
Cats don't know who you fucking with
Till you fucking with X and you stuck in shit
I just got some shit I need to get off my chest
Look around and I see the rap game is a mess
Upset and insane in how the game gonna change shit
I came to get down if you came to get down
And if you feel like T feel baby
Don't you know how sweet and wonderful
Come on come on come on come on baby
Lets floss through the hood
Ma paint job wet like a maxi pad
I ride on chrome each everyday
Every song I get don't get radio played
I'm only 18 but ma candy drip
I let ma bumper kit hang
Lets floss through the hood...
O and let yo slab come down
Baby can you feel me ooh
I just got to be T. that's all I can be
Slide for the wide body ride high side cause that ain't
Never been me and ain't gone never be me and now its
Chop shop on a beat bubble squirm and tweet
From the North to the South the East and the West
Big T. in the house tonight
South World y'all in the house tonight
In House in the house tonight
And I always keep a bad broad close to me
He say we gotta do a show at the bayou classic
All I need is a 8 to go wit my pound
Big T. in the house tonight
South World y'all in the house tonight
In House in the house tonight
Some things have changed a million dollars laid it down
Big T. what you gonna do
I gotta stay on my game so I want even slip
So what a brother got another brother do you
Taught me how to stay down and be true
So Big T. in the house tonight
South World y'all in the house tonight
In House in the house tonight
Too much bad boy comedy
In the cities community
Too much bad boy parody
More guns and violence than an American movie
Too much bad boy comedy
Too much bad boy parody
Next time I will see you without the rest of your posse
You want the key of the town you want the key of the city
You run out of love so you run out of pity
You beat up the youth and you smash up the grannies
No I don't wanna be a little bang gang rookie
Me live through the eyes of no body
Get the respect from the people I don't need no brutality
Hold on with the crime and the murdering industry
When you live on the wrong side of the city
Respect is the key of the success
Nevertheless they make you live in the wrong place
But you got to keep the faith
It's a new day a new life for me
Got to give thanks to the people who came before me
Lord keep my self away from dirty poverty
And some say it's just a day
But the life for me is such a miracle
I've got to give thanks and praise
I give thanks everyday so the blessings multiply
You stay stupefy and you can't deny
They wanna divide my gaggle
Still me struggle on the battle
No they can't stop my hustle
I don't want no ordinary living kind a trouble
And anything you do you do it as a sample
Now dance till you cripple
Have no right to be what I am
The felling is the same
Have no right to be what I am
But until you kill me I'm still a living man
Why you wanna treat me like the latest dump
You say I'm a freak I'm punk
You think I beg the coin
But the world is my home so you can tell me none
I don't wanna sit and listen
Cause your moral has no sense your discipline
You rob the whole France
You say I don't know about your country
But I've been all over the land
You say I don't know about your country
But I've been all over the land
Come follow me follow me follow me now...
They want to see me go
Tell me why the government and the system
They want to see me go
Tell me why the government and the system
Have no right to be what I am
Have no right to be what I am
But when you're thirsty and I'm thirsty the feeling is the same
Have no right to be what I am
But when you cold and I'm cold the feeling is the same
Yeah I'm a real vagabond
You ever see me in a town
And the music that I create makes me passing by
Hard drugs will never never travel my miles
Give me my girl and my book
I grow the herb and the hook
You gotta keep it to your mind
It's been a long long time we've been hustling
It's been a long long time we've been struggling
Ina the night till god a bless the morning
Hustle man ah hustle man ah
Hustle man ah hustle man ah

You could be slim you could be fat
You could be white you could be black
Clean up them brain with a big piece of soap
Some much cocaine so much people sniff that
You could be slim you could be fat
Clean up them brain with a big piece
I am like a gun on the battle like a lion in the jungle
I know how to run my hustle on and that without muscles
Than a vehicle when it comes to the microphone
Yes I know how to make girls wriggle
Listen and enjoy this shit like the Simpson
Turn up the volume gal a wine up in the room
Get close like a zoom cool like I could
Raging like a bull when I come under your wool
And if you feel like the things you've got before was similar
That's the life that we living...
This is how we're really feeling...
And we no need to hype up
From my heart me no need to hide up
Some boys are too wild they're moving like some cavemen
Amen I'm on a different segment
To get the money and the life I really expect
Sometime Acapulco it depends
Yes I'm French plus I'm famous like Johnny
Me strong like a grizzly
You know who the fuck it is
Anything we do you know it must get release
That's the life that we living...
This is how we're really feeling...
That's the life that we living...
Deeper than the deepest ocean
This ah style they can't touch
That the people love so much
The natty dub music make you get up and bounce
And even if you're broke by the end of the month
This ah style they can't touch
That the people love so much
So we kill it with the knowledge
Call upon the third eye
It's like so many kids they were born to cry
This ah style they can't touch
That the people love so much
The natty dub music make you get up and bounce
And even if you're broke by the end of the month
This ah style they can't touch
That the people love so much
So we kill it with the knowledge
Call upon the third eye
It's like so many kids they were born to cry
This ah style they can't touch

Electric fire brain plug your fingers in the socket
Forget bout your worries when we ram it and we jam it
We bus a show in every city we go
We brew you up like a nice cup a tea
We bus a show in every city we go
You gotta keep it to your mind

I love to love you love you baby long time
Our story come again yes ah rewind
Remember when we met yes ah ghetto time
I love to love you love you baby long time
Our story come again yes ah rewind
Remember when we met yes ah ghetto time
She just ah pop it pop it up
And rub it and dub it up until ah morning
And than you groove upon the bass
Gal you make me know that mi bless
I must confess without your love
I'm like the rain without the clouds
I'm like the bones without the dogs
I'm like the French without the frogs
Girl you good like a big tune ah play
Girl you good like a big tune ah play
I give you love and affection
And your body in mi party
She just a pop I pop it up
And rub it and dub it up until a morning
You took me by surprise double six on the dice
The tears that I drop are bigger than the French fries
Girl I want you to quit your job for me
Fresh water love and hole hip a herb
She just a pop I pop it up
You are star a town when you walk down the road
Ina the middle a the moon light you shine on your own
Listen to the music get a wine up
And you're shy baby girl you no hype up
On the big major label they wanna sign up
You are star a town when you walk down the road
Ina the middle a moon light you shine on your own
She make me put my gun away
I'm the predator she's the prey
Your ex boyfriend he was heartless
Nothing to compare with this artist
You are star a town when you walk down the road
Ina the middle a moon light you shine on your own
She make me put my gun away
We take it back we take it back we take it back to the street days
When the life it wasn't wasn't sweet like a cheese cake
Take it take it take it take it back to the street days
When the life it wasn't sweet like a cheese...
Everyday it ah the same like a life time struggle
Gonna feed you to the dog like a dirty piece a mouton
We take it back we take it back we take it back to the street days
When the life it wasn't wasn't sweet like a cheese cake
Take it take it take it take it back to the street days
When the life it wasn't sweet like a cheese...
If you follow him there is one option it's your own demise
Call me lucky when I play my cards and roll the dice
And when you chat ah mi say that ah that ah big pack of lies
Mi crush you like an insect like a big parasite
We take it back we take it back we take it back to the street days
When the life it wasn't wasn't sweet like a cheese cake
Take it take it take it take it back to the street days
When the life it wasn't sweet like a cheese...
Take it back we take it back we take it back to the street days
Everything is gonna be all right
Everything is gonna be all right
Push up your hand from your body it right
She see mi ting and take mi sweet pine
But the pine too sweet she squeeze it like lime
Skin look clean and your body well right
And ah good school you go you can read and write
Everything is gonna be all right
Everything is gonna be all right
Push up your hand from your body it right
She like it hot like curry with spice
She bless my day like a Jesus Christ
Big batty bumper and she shake it on time
Like a day job from 9 till 5
A so mi fix it up and mi work it from behind
Everything is gonna be all right
Everything is gonna be all right
Push up your hand from you know your body it right
We do it better than a big city dweller
We do it better than a big city dweller

Your body good and it right right right
Everything is gonna be all right
Everything is gonna be all right
Push up your hand from you know your body it right

Mount a crazy gal a jump up

Tonight you know you single
Mi is a five finger trigger
Mi is a five finger trigger
Bad to the bone bad to the bone

You know it s hot and it s melting down
No they can't keep the people under control
Despite the suffering we got to stand tall
Oh lord I pray this wall will fall
Brick by brick we gonna make it tumble down
No they can't keep the people under control
Despite the suffering we got to stand tall
We've got to cross the borderline
We've got to cross the borderline
No they can't keep the people under control
I make you float and fly
So you've got to close your eyes
I'm in the session like
Ready to play another song another track
Turn it up turn it down
Turn it up turn it down
And move how you should
Selection is more than ready
Turn it up turn it down
And if you don't know now you know
Lane black on the beat
It's coming like a dream I tell you
Turn it up turn it down
Turn it up turn it down
Turn it up turn it down
Turn it up turn it down
I bring the hype and the glass
Come follow me massive
Predominant number one
Follow me to the top and to the very last drop
The sound that we got we about to play it non stop
Operator old the disk and pull it down
Operator old the disk and pull it down
Put on my favorite record and i let it play
I say true to the game i am a real cat
I say true to the game i am a real cat
Come on operator drop that on the sound system
Come on operator drop that on the sound system
Every other day I show
I got no time for myself
I just roll another one
I've got my girl friend on the bed
And we just wanna have fun
Ridding on my skateboard
Heading to the bakery
I want to get some nice
Croissants and coffee
You wanna to take me to the show
I don't wanna wake up
I be smoking and drinking
I don't wanna wake up
But I know I gotta go
I don't wanna wake up
My dream full of smoke
I be party on a Monday
Every other days I show
I've got no time for myself
Let's have another drink
Tonight it's me who pay
I don't even have a car
Just some weed in my cigar
Liquid sunshine it's raining a lot
Liquid sunshine the weather is hot
Liquid sunshine it's raining a lot
Liquid sunshine the weather is hot
Take me to the sunset of the palms
Liquid sunshine it's raining a lot
Liquid sunshine the weather is hot
Girl I passed the day
That you coming on my life
And I swear to stars that you have to be my wife
But sometimes winter sometimes summer
Our love is going to last forever
We got so much loving to share
Today you dry my tears
So he said which bitch
Yeah bitch bitch yeah yeah
So much Love in the Air
This is the shit and makes your pee even more yellow mantra
Keeps coming out like you flip the trip kicker
Going definitely way too much like brain chocolate abroad
If you don't jump on the count of three
By the rivers of cash flow
By the rivers of cash flow
We underground warriors beneath the surface
My soul is my own and it's not for purchase
We underground warriors beneath the surface
My soul is my own and it's not for purchase
Distraction is a device that tried to destroy my life
I pulled away from the dark towards the light
But the gravity attracts me the more that I fight
Billions of souls trapped between the negative and positive poles
I watch most people become what they loathe
Billions of verses my purpose is my focus
Colder than Charles Manson getting open heart surgery in Anchorage Alaska
If you wanna save Jasper from those bloody assassins
Tsunami flow from seven seas that'll never recede
Rap music was created by a deep rooted passion to prove it
I got a plan to get this money nonstop
Dem hoes see my vision
If a special on my mind den I'll address ya
Don't come around the crib
You know its give or take
I gotta stay straight
You know I would relate
Let me make it out alive
This is the story of my life
This is the story of my life
This is the story of my life
This is the story of my life
I'm coming from the hood
I live a life of crime
Mama died without warning me
All I know is poverty
Slaying drugs and robbery
Mugging like everyday
I'm meanest to society
Foul on the side of me
Who got the balls to betray me
I can't see nothing there
Had a dollar and fifteen cents
Lived a life of scene
My face on the TV and what this little mind gonna need again
I ain't trying to make a dollar I ain't trying to make it free
We don't get down like them clown syndicates
Fortunately my music is never watery
Maybe you should grab a telescope to see my view it's like astronomy
It ain't all about economy
Never sell my soul is my philosophy
I bomb your set that's not a threat it's a promise
But still I never claim to be a big rap star
You ain't never heard an emcee speak like this
And Rodney King ain't never felt a beat like this
So you ain't that high wanna be aeronautic
A close encounter of the worst kind
Go ask the cats that heard I'm lyrical turpentine
God give the bass line so let the phlegm fly
I'm learned in old schools of thought and shit you baffled by
Conceptual intellectual fire slide
Fill this join to capacity
My platoon never at ease
Deadly I'm out already to seize the seas
Deep as twenty thousand leagues
Drown rappers in my syllabus
Chameleons can't adapt to this
No need to practice this
Is naturally disastrous
These civil rights activists
Don't want none of me
I'm ripping foes apart
So remain seated like Rosa Parks
Nobody's next to grab it
I'm the Narcotics Anonymous Dope Emcee
On the hunt like scavenger
For months on the calendar
Any challenger trying to test this caliber
Binary Star battle your villainous characters to the end
Get in simple complications
Burning sensations inflames these lame stations
Spectacular vernacular
There's no discussion
We set flames to your productions
Binary Star is here to take it over
I'll tie your body to the tracks
My rhymes run you over like trains
One Man Army assume the battle stance
You never had a chance
We got it locked like Dominoes
I write articles equivalent to light particles
We fire on all these cats catch hell when I exhale
The mainstream as well
We don't blaze the same trail
Drink from the same well
My only purpose is to derail the infidel
And bust his head swell
And expel that crap smell
Propel your personnel
Far from y'all to those that don't fare well
Your petty plan failed in your lifespan can tell
You ain't close or parallel
You need rainbows and leprechauns to go gold
I'm dropping these lyrical Megatons
Transform my trigger hand's warm
I take aim and bust enemy planes
Remain calm like Saddam Hussein
It's obvious who remains Anonymous
My words get off like a SCUD in the Persian Gulf
Binary Star is here to take it over
On the battlefield I grab the steel like William Wallace
Frostbit from the words I spit
And I won't hesitate to embarrass ya
The only paraphernalia I need to rock the spot
On a track to beat your whole team without a relay
Like Tom Cruise and don't know the definition of fail
On these cats like UV rays so get your sunblock
We concoct the rock from explosive materials
Binary Star hit you like a SWAT team
You make a better slot machine
I told you once before not to push me
Awful aqua that floods the menstrual
The Formula One devil
My reservoir pours Great Lakes fifty States
For how I distribute to you and yours
We bum rush like a drug bust
Transforming slang on the fire maximize
Complete fumigation better jet for ventilation
Some call it a kaiser
Now which bastard wants some acid
Corrosive chemicals casted
Spitting venom I mastered
Ran with dogs as rabid and rivers as rapid
Rapping five we don't tire
And when you flames want to tussle we got on the muscle
Snatch of the rock when you cats fumble
Star hiding any stop when we do the shuffle
My mobile dispenser for hire like Spencer
In the C with the industry
How we revolutionize like Revolts to Red Coats
Binary Star got it locked like dead folks
Let your hair soak in this tub of styles
Break it down to the last compound
Surround your town pound with surround sound tell me how that sound
So when we move through your suckle know we're double trouble
And when you get gassed up we gonna bust your bubble
Even the proudest of cats get made humble
When they run upon a star and we do the shuffle
You may not know me now but you will later
Attempting to rub elbows and have us pop flicks
Getting in the mix don't even know the recipe
You know my aptitude ain't no need for testing me
Just move along now ain't nothing to see here
We got this baby and we gonna be here
Keep it cool at whatever even while we struggle
The notorious Athletic Mic League
We do it just like this
Rhymes come together like crochet
My command to make you ear ring like bamboo
You better Bounce like dryer sheets.
From the raps that I swung
Strap got you hung from the crap that you spun
Cause on the rough tour I rock heads like Mt Rushmore
Binary Star Athletic Mic League assembling fire kindling
Gods gift to adrenaline
See my dreads break the blade of Delilah
My net concentrates the quick twitch muscle fiber
Show a little affection
Side to side just like a spectrum
These waters are treacherous and
Need to get up on your studies
School's in session for you and your butt buddies
Take it back to rhyme structure 101 for you dummies
Many cats try to rap with this
It don't matter how matter how many rhymes you spit
Here's that other shit that y'all ain't discovered yet
And my pockets is holding treasury
These styles is unknown truth
Like where Clark Kent goes
When Superman steps out the phone booth
My mind and mouth should have came with a cape
And now Lois Lane wants a date
My fame rates higher than my pulse that's false
I'm so damn excited I made the Pointer Sisters silent
Make a pacifist get violent
In exchange for a handsome sum
Going down like Young Guns
In a blaze of glory before we're done
Rappers antagonists come to aggravate
Through the elimination process
Walking poetry in progress
Be it world tour or conquest
So I embark on this expedition
In Napoleon tradition I'm a small man with complex expositions
Marvel of exhibitions
If you want to stay in the kitchen
Trigger fingers itching
Shoot the gift like Mitch Richmond
Did I fail to mention
Tricky like Samantha Bewitching
They could stop my flow
There's no prevention
Tilt your head back and look at the Stars
We back on the scene like herpes
Stronger than Hercules
Able to rock crowds from nurseries to Universities
My beats and rhymes perfectly
Tonya Harding couldn't touch it
Pop it in your Benz or your bucket
From the suburbs to boondocks
From skyscrapers to Green Acres
Like we bowling three hundred
Sold to the highest bidder
I flow like the Tigris river
More reasons to call us your favorite Emcees
Like Binary Star riffing rhymes over these
You would do the same if you was in our position
Platinum sales is not the mission
I seek and destroy my opposition
Including anything that make me not want to listen
Labels need to chill with they Clark Gable deals
I get down like people in tornado drills
I'm in a different category
The two headed dragon
Same ankle that enabled Kain to slew that's a sharp blade
Whether your willing or able I see your stockade
I'm from an age where I just played caption
Can't escape slavery boy
Microphone cyclone blowing in your ears like your girlfriend
Broke as hell in a Lincoln
Head on collisions in these rap competitions
My crew cats record turns their frames into scrape metal
I brought you stigmas when your hides bust in line a temper
This is a warning to you men
We're joining these tournaments of journalists and live by the pen
Battle vocalist the one man army in a war against a bliss
Don't just step to this
Kids try to follow but get swallowed in the ocean
I'm ill with the poetry
Heads like John the Baptist
Others fugitive style your brains couldn't capture
Ever since the beginning of time
Forbidden poetry is a life
That'll carry no weight like space shuttles
You can have a little taste of that good life too
You'd do it to your own kind
We need to try to keep this music to ourselves
All we need is beats and rhymes to go and spark it
I don't need a major to tell me how to run it
Cause my goal's to win the Indy 500
That's your axle and your ratchet man
And if you ever finish first a platinum trophy is risen
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win the Indy 500
I came to collect my checks and that's my call
In the beginning man was created. Image perfection.
Hold on for dear life no matter the obstacles in your path
Destiny is not temporary and true love will always last.
Shall fulfill destinies plan and together become one.
Completion. The evolution of man.
Eventually if it was meant to be
Eventually if it was meant to be
Eventually if it was meant to be
Eventually if it was meant to be
Eventually if it was meant to be
Your explosive personality blows my mentality
Actually my emotions on a rampage
Never amateur check the calendar let's make a reservation
Communication is the bridge at times
The truth will set you free like Abe Lincoln
Is due to the love together we've created
Our thoughts no longer separated
Past barriers past road blocks you've opened
My heart no need to pick the lock
The key to my heart should be the sole controller
Life is full of ups and downs like a roller coaster
As long as you're a soldier I'm hanging in your world like a poster
Supernova baby you shine extraterrestrial
Sometimes you throw me off like Jonah on a water vessel
But what we got is crazy real
Deep like a Navy Seal
Plus I like the way you make me feel baby chill
You know the deal you playing with a full deck
Trump tight no jokes ace's high in full affect
Your affecting me and it's crazy cause love is a gamble
But now I ease dizzy from to much exhaling
That's absurd like a butcher without a knife
I slice through your thoughts with words that cut you short
Your torch keep me burning my world no longer dark
I spark with the best but you no contest
Conquest on your love my mission accomplished
I feed you the knowledge your system digests
You feed me the knowledge my system digests
We make love in excess
I see through the bullshit
That's why I like your style
Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound
Eventually if it was meant to be
Eventually if it was meant to be
Eventually if it was meant to be
Physically and mentally we related
Now I'm elated what was once meant to be is our reality
And I'm loving every moment of our ecstasy
Not too many people get a chance to see
A connection between two people based not on sexuality
That's how you make me feel
We formed a bond and I could go on forever
Telling the world how together we're two of a kind
What's mine is yours what's your is mine
Throughout the course of time
We stay on point like a porcupine
Anytime everything move faster
Every king need a queen so you could be my Cleopatra
I sock it to you I know you got the point
Baby doll I got the voodoo
I want you for the rest of my life
And time is starting your love makes me
Weak in the knees like Tonya Harding
You stole my heart and that's a felony
Prison is the penalty confined in my mind in brain cell block 3
I locked you in my heart and threw away the key
There's no escape I guard it like a maximum security
Knowing that your soul not just your physical is here with me
And I thank the all mighty for the day that you invited me
And book me I stole your heart yes I'm guilty so punish me
Because your maximum security reassures me
I be there like the Jackson 5 satisfaction's
Why I step to you with my plan like a mastermind
We pass the time as we dine you sip a glass of wine
I looked you in your eyes
And cast a line out of that's just mine
You was amazed by the way that I attacked
Now your white flag is raised high blowing in the gray sky
Surrender your goods completely understood
I told you once before baby I hit you
With these them other cats don't stand
A chance like Christopher Reeves
You're not the type to wear provocative clothes
Good looking what you got cooking
17 ways word to Michael Franks
I take it downtown baby calm down making all the sounds
Like a figure 8 it's perfect all around
Eventually if it was meant to be
Eventually if it was meant to be
Dashed in to a world with killers robbers and thieves
Cramped in a 8 man cell with 10 cats
8 on the bunks and 3 on just mats
Going back and fourth the circuit
My life hanging on a verdict and laws I'm unable to interpret
I just knew I had to do some time...
Had me feeling pail and dry
Circles forming under my eyes from sleepless weeks
A huge weight bearing on my back
I'm chain smoking roll ups in attempts to kind of act and write my rap
Routine ain't a damn thing new
So much time and so little to do
Just waiting on a court date so I can get through
Caught between a rock in a hard place
Prosecution had a hard case
So I'd have to plead or escape
Fresh 25 piece like a noose with a rope
I couldn't go that rout no doubt
So I waited for the best offer and I got the hell out
Barbed wire and guards in the gun tower secured the gate
The system is designed to stock it plentiful
This old cat from the hood
The world wasn't ready for the changes I made
Anything to make the time fly soon as possible
Heads getting cracked over unpaid debts
Either a shank or a lock on the side would do the trick
I know why the caged bird sings...
Like sand through the hourglass
So are the days of our lives
And for that live moment we thrive
Simple minds can't keep up with this
I'm a put it on the table
I ain't the kinda guy who carry on for dough
The material cat who walk around for show
These lames run around like mice in the maze
Wanna change time's schemes to make man worships things
Over the supreme being or stop fill up
It makes no difference that you're a product of environment
There ain't no more innocence or civil men of penitence
They mimic shit they see on TV or hear in a song
Where I'm from your reputation don't mean jack
You ain't no different from the next cat in my neighborhood who did time
Rhyme after rhymes it's the same topic
You need to stop fronting
Every time you listen to the radio all you hear is nonsense
They never play the bomb shit
Everything that glitters ain't gold
It used to be real hip
How many cats you know
Either you innocent or guilty
Some of my favorite emcees fell off
It damn near killed me
My favorite crew members break up
Turn around and join whack ones
It ain't the money that's the issue
And I'm a bring it to you like never
Like sand through the hourglass
So are the days of our lives
Simple minds can't keep up with this
I'm a put it on the table
I ain't the kinda guy who carry out for dough
The material cat who walk around for show
I ain't never been the one to follow trend
These lames walk around like mice in the maze
One escapes time seems to make
Man worships things over the supreme thing
They mimic shit they see on TV or hear in a song
You ain't no different from the next cat in my neighborhood who did time
Rhyme after rhymes it's the same topic
Every time you listen to the radio
Everything that glitters ain't gold
It used to be real hip
How many cats you know
Either you innocent or guilty
Some of my favorite emcees fell of
It damn near killed me
My favorite crew members break up
Turn around and join whack ones
It ain't the money that's the issue
And I'm a bring it to you like never
Try to jump my crew if you cats feel boggy
I didn't love the baby's mother
For the better that my other lady's name was Heather
But finally she pleaded that she didn't want to end it or suspend it
She wanted me to sever ties with Heather
So we could be together
Then invited me for supper
Now don't think that I'm petty
But I know what desperate ladies put in their spaghetti
That's why I told her that I ate already
The next day I got a letter
I can't quote it in the same exact words she stated
But it was saying something about the times that we dated
She said she hated me for leaving
And soon she would get even
Right in the middle of this thought I was caught by surprise
It was a call from the hospital
Somebody named Dr. Evans
Telling me that my lovely Heather was in room 311
So pedal to the metal I got there in seven seconds
I asked the doc what happened
A hit and run accident and not a single witness police never caught the driver
Deep inside I knew that Patty did this
I caught one to play me close like her name was Glenn
And I'll be damned if I ever let it happen again
The place of birth of the evil man's work
Nights like tonight he would rather stay up
Most people in the neighborhood afraid to speak
Full moons make a man wild
That's when a hairy figure jumped from the train
Ned had no idea it was a hoax
On the bloody backseat laid his two friends headless
Wolf man jack strikes again
Just like my man and his crew
You're still a soldier of it... soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it... soldier of it
You're still a soldier... soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it... soldier of it
The mystery pilot in the cockpit all night
See how my enemies know style
The name of my plane is the pit bull terrier
Over your head when I break the sound barrier
So fly my voice need an aircraft carrier
Keep the jams packed like church on Easter Sunday
Rappers thinking they shall overcome one day
They must be dreaming and I'm lyrical James Earl Ray
It's the one man army
You're still a soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it... soldier of it
You're still a soldier... soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it... soldier of it
That's like trying to fight the hacker
Turn in to a nuclear test site
It's the one man army
You're still a soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it... soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it... soldier of it
You're still a soldier... soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it... soldier of it
Six thousand leagues beneath MC level
I love to battle with other rappers and sink they battle ships
Sonar equipment is a stupid investment
I've been in more missions than a homeless
Always on point like a compass
Three hundred and sixty degrees
One Man Army in the place to be
Yo it's the one man army on a mission
It's the one man army on a mission
It's the one man army on a mission
The KGB make this stage twice as dangerous as these streets
When we unsheathe the swords and the One Man Army brings beats to boards
Be thankful you still alive
While the faithfully by the frames catch records eye
You choose to dangerously tangle with me
You can hang out make Jack the Ripper look like your guardian angel anger me
I give you enough light cable to hang yourself
Strike with enough force to puncture a lung
Get introduced to mines and meet your demise
I despise rap guys and all they whack ties
I'm what you asking for
I'll give you that plus a classic more
Mic heavyweights to shake the planet core
Better off dancing with wolves
Bent lies that'll force you to quit
Drag they face in the mud till they mouth looks like they bit a brick
Butts like magnificent seven on horseback
Its deadly as the one you put your thumbs on
And squeeze from the bottom
With fatigues but I'm high in the trees so high I can breath on a falcon
A predator with the literature
It shows through my signature
What's even more sick is I'm a visitor
Sneak within the floor
Murder emcees and leave my fingerprints on doorknobs
And its bloodsport open up my mind from watch those slugs walk gracefully
Where your head reside is now a vacancy
When I die I want my third eye born
Style like tracks to smack who can't stab me
I'm trying to count zeros and hoes like Hugh Hefner
O type Star I blew spots when I said things
My thoughts take flight like black hawks with red wings
I hit your whole system when I shine with the Binary
And I'm in the presence of perfection
I'm freshman at this game but we trying to graduate
The differences is I don't judge my manhood by what my sales are
I'm the coldest since winter
So I advise you to remember your roles
A whack emcee is something I could never be
That's like growing dreadlocks while you taking chemotherapy
Theoretically pen and paper is the recipe
Alphabetically I'm coming after you like the letter V
You'll never get the best of me
Call it like a referee
Break the law of gravity
And lyrically catch a felony
I make it harder for the next emcee that's my specialty
I'm a hard act to follow I could prove it medically
I'm sick in the head I could move a crowd with mental telepathy
Shoot the sheriff then the deputy
Whoever think they fat can get the Dig Gregory
Its countless how many rappers over vinyl we scar
Even freestyle in French when I'm rhyming abroad
Rap is black jack and JUICE is like a primary card
Yesterday I spit game at your dame and she paused
To let me see a thick frame and outline it with drawers
So the chance you been looking for is finally yours
The KGB make this stage twice as dangerous as these streets
When we unsheathe the swords and the One Man Army brings beats to boards
Be thankful you still alive
While the faithfully by the frames catch records eye
You choose to dangerously tangle with me
You can hang out make Jack the Ripper look like your guardian angel anger me
I give you enough light cable to hang yourself
Strike with enough force to puncture a lung
Get introduced to mines and meet your demise
I despise rap guys and all they whack ties
I'm what you asking for
I'll give you that plus a classic more
Mic heavyweights to shake the planet core
Better off dancing with wolves
Bent lies that'll force you to quit
Drag they face in the mud till they mouth looks like they bit a brick
Butts like magnificent seven on horseback
Its deadly as the one you put your thumbs on
And squeeze from the bottom
With fatigues but I'm high in the trees so high I can breath on a falcon
A predator with the literature
It shows through my signature
What's even more sick is I'm a visitor
Sneak within the floor
Murder emcees and leave my fingerprints on doorknobs
And its bloodsport open up my mind from watch those slugs walk gracefully
Where your head reside is now a vacancy
When I die I want my third eye born
Style like tracks to smack who can't stab me
I'm trying to count zeros and hoes like Hugh Hefner
O type Star I blew spots when I said things
My thoughts take flight like black hawks with red wings
I hit your whole system when I shine with the Binary
And I'm in the presence of perfection
I'm freshman at this game but we trying to graduate
The differences is I don't judge my manhood by what my sales are
I'm the coldest since winter
So I advise you to remember your roles
A whack emcee is something I could never be
That's like growing dreadlocks while you taking chemotherapy
Theoretically pen and paper is the recipe
Alphabetically I'm coming after you like the letter V
You'll never get the best of me
Call it like a referee
Break the law of gravity
And lyrically catch a felony
I make it harder for the next emcee that's my specialty
I'm a hard act to follow I could prove it medically
I'm sick in the head I could move a crowd with mental telepathy
Shoot the sheriff then the deputy
Whoever think they fat can get the Dig Gregory
Its countless how many rappers over vinyl we scar
Even freestyle in French when I'm rhyming abroad
Rap is black jack and JUICE is like a primary card
Yesterday I spit game at your dame and she paused
To let me see a thick frame and outline it with drawers
So the chance you been looking for is finally yours
Dashed in to a world with killers robbers and thieves
Cramped in a 8 man cell with 10 cats
8 on the bunks and 3 on just mats
Going back and fourth the circuit
My life hanging on a verdict and laws I'm unable to interpret
I just knew I had to do some time...
Had me feeling pail and dry
Circles forming under my eyes from sleepless weeks
A huge weight bearing on my back
I'm chain smoking roll ups in attempts to kind of act and write my rap
Routine ain't a damn thing new
So much time and so little to do
Just waiting on a court date so I can get through
Caught between a rock in a hard place
Prosecution had a hard case
So I'd have to plead or escape
Fresh 25 piece like a noose with a rope
I couldn't go that rout no doubt
So I waited for the best offer and I got the hell out
Barbed wire and guards in the gun tower secured the gate
The system is designed to stock it plentiful
This old cat from the hood
The world wasn't ready for the changes I made
Anything to make the time fly soon as possible
Heads getting cracked over unpaid debts
Either a shank or a lock on the side would do the trick
I know why the caged bird sings...
You're still a soldier of it... soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it... soldier of it
You're still a soldier... soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it... soldier of it
The mystery pilot in the cockpit all night
See how my enemies know style
The name of my plane is the pit bull terrier
Over your head when I break the sound barrier
So fly my voice need an aircraft carrier
Keep the jams packed like church on Easter Sunday
Rappers thinking they shall overcome one day
They must be dreaming and I'm lyrical James Earl Ray
It's the one man army
You're still a soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it... soldier of it
You're still a soldier... soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it... soldier of it
That's like trying to fight the hacker
Turn in to a nuclear test site
It's the one man army
You're still a soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it... soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it... soldier of it
You're still a soldier... soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it... soldier of it
Six thousand leagues beneath MC level
I love to battle with other rappers and sink they battle ships
Sonar equipment is a stupid investment
I've been in more missions than a homeless
Always on point like a compass
Three hundred and sixty degrees
One Man Army in the place to be
Yo it's the one man army on a mission
It's the one man army on a mission
It's the one man army on a mission
In the beginning man was created. Image perfection.
Hold on for dear life no matter the obstacles in your path
Destiny is not temporary and true love will always last.
Shall fulfill destinies plan and together become one.
Completion. The evolution of man.
Eventually if it was meant to be
Eventually if it was meant to be
Eventually if it was meant to be
Eventually if it was meant to be
Eventually if it was meant to be
Your explosive personality blows my mentality
Actually my emotions on a rampage
Never amateur check the calendar let's make a reservation
Communication is the bridge at times
The truth will set you free like Abe Lincoln
Is due to the love together we've created
Our thoughts no longer separated
Past barriers past road blocks you've opened
My heart no need to pick the lock
The key to my heart should be the sole controller
Life is full of ups and downs like a roller coaster
As long as you're a soldier I'm hanging in your world like a poster
Supernova baby you shine extraterrestrial
Sometimes you throw me off like Jonah on a water vessel
But what we got is crazy real
Deep like a Navy Seal
Plus I like the way you make me feel baby chill
You know the deal you playing with a full deck
Trump tight no jokes ace's high in full affect
Your affecting me and it's crazy cause love is a gamble
But now I ease dizzy from to much exhaling
That's absurd like a butcher without a knife
I slice through your thoughts with words that cut you short
Your torch keep me burning my world no longer dark
I spark with the best but you no contest
Conquest on your love my mission accomplished
I feed you the knowledge your system digests
You feed me the knowledge my system digests
We make love in excess
I see through the bullshit
That's why I like your style
Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound
Eventually if it was meant to be
Eventually if it was meant to be
Eventually if it was meant to be
Physically and mentally we related
Now I'm elated what was once meant to be is our reality
And I'm loving every moment of our ecstasy
Not too many people get a chance to see
A connection between two people based not on sexuality
That's how you make me feel
We formed a bond and I could go on forever
Telling the world how together we're two of a kind
What's mine is yours what's your is mine
Throughout the course of time
We stay on point like a porcupine
Anytime everything move faster
Every king need a queen so you could be my Cleopatra
I sock it to you I know you got the point
Baby doll I got the voodoo
I want you for the rest of my life
And time is starting your love makes me
Weak in the knees like Tonya Harding
You stole my heart and that's a felony
Prison is the penalty confined in my mind in brain cell block 3
I locked you in my heart and threw away the key
There's no escape I guard it like a maximum security
Knowing that your soul not just your physical is here with me
And I thank the all mighty for the day that you invited me
And book me I stole your heart yes I'm guilty so punish me
Because your maximum security reassures me
I be there like the Jackson 5 satisfaction's
Why I step to you with my plan like a mastermind
We pass the time as we dine you sip a glass of wine
I looked you in your eyes
And cast a line out of that's just mine
You was amazed by the way that I attacked
Now your white flag is raised high blowing in the gray sky
Surrender your goods completely understood
I told you once before baby I hit you
With these them other cats don't stand
A chance like Christopher Reeves
You're not the type to wear provocative clothes
Good looking what you got cooking
17 ways word to Michael Franks
I take it downtown baby calm down making all the sounds
Like a figure 8 it's perfect all around
Eventually if it was meant to be
Eventually if it was meant to be
See for yourself and tell me what you analyze
Be the greatest thing to happen to a button that rewinds
My lyrical equipment like the stuff NASA got
I'm just a microphone metaphor specializer
So when it comes to speech I'm an exerciser
I demonstrate the line that'll penetrate your mind
The consequence will be the first down like ten yards
That's where I send hordes
So... nine millimeter is what I carry
Money is the root... of all this evil
Your hand touches my cheek as you whisper softly
Don't forget to breathe
Our love will be redeemed
And when you take my hand
You'll know exactly where I am
And I look to the sea and hear you calling softly
Don't forget to breathe
Our love will be redeemed
And when you take my hand
You'll know exactly where I am
I hear you calling to me
See you but you can't see me
We never said our goodbyes
So dark and lonely your eyes
You'll always be in my heart
There is no death to us part
Don't forget to breathe
Our love will be redeemed
And when you take my hand
Dance with me across the ocean floor
Sail away to heaven's open door
Step right up you're the next contestant
In this sweet charade
Hold me close enough to drink my rose
The devil in my pocket turn to go
Step right up who's the next contestant
I've got nothing left to say to you
Don't care for salty conditions
Stop begging me to stay with you
Don't care much for inhibitions
Everyone dreams about heaven
Nobody knows what to think
The truth is I go to heaven
Every time you look at me
If I wait too long I may not say goodnight
Never knowing how or when I might just die
Everyone dreams about something
Heaven can be anything
The truth is that my slice of heaven
Tastes better than my favorite drink
If I wait too long I may not say goodnight
If I take my time then maybe you will find
I'm sailing on a sea of sweet that's you
If I wait too long I may not say goodnight
If I take my time then maybe you will find
I've tasted your bittersweet faith
My heart aches for you
I'm taking a moment to say
Lay your sweet tears across my broken dream
Don't you speak a word about the past
You need more than I'll ever give
A high price for the beauty of perfection
I go when all I want to do is stay
Standing naked in the rain
One step closer to insane
No one left here to blame
Your tune to set the mood
Rearranging everything you do
Sweeping up after my shame
On the seventh day of the week
I pray the lord my soul to keep
My legs are moving slow
Unlike anything I've known
On the seventh night of the week
I try to cry myself back to sleep
I've got a bad boy and that's alright with me
His dirty laundry is nothing that I can't keep clean
And when he needs an alibi
He can use me all night
I think I'd rather misbehave
Won't make excuses for anything I'm doing wrong
I'll pull the trigger in a flash
Wouldn't you rather misbehave
Oh baby show me the money my evil friend
I'll light a candle for good luck
Now come on baby let's...
I think I'd rather misbehave
Think I'd rather misbehave
Walk away from the pain
To take away the beauty of
Just trying to find my way to you
I realize I may not get over you
Darkness falls on the sound
The bible of distinction and love
Just trying to find my way to you
I realize I may not get over you
Just want to be with you
Staring at the lonely face of winter in your eyes
Knowing that the calm before the storm weighs on my mind
Washing all my dreams away
My skin is stinging from the chill you left me
I long for lazy days of summertime
With your head held high
With a random act of kind
And remember to take two blue
Yours to do with what you choose to keep in stride
You're not feeling fine
Some more of that nutritious wine
Take two more blue and you'll be okay
But let's get one thing straight dear
But let's get one thing straight dear
Darling don't step on my toes
I'm not the girl who will chase you
But let's get one thing straight dear
You can be Tarzan and I'll be Jane
We'll swing along from tree to tree my friend
Or we can pretend to be shipwrecked at sea
Just come along with me
We'll drink Bloody Marys in a cemetery
I'm falling in love with you
Can't you see that I'm falling in love with you
Can't you see that...
I'll take a trip with you anytime
Just come along with me
No time for sleeping.
There's too much to do
Don't you forget that we do what they want us to
Let's get nuts. Let's spend some money
Take your shirt off honey
Won't be sorry Charlie
Taste all your hearts desires. Take a boat ride through the sky and play
They can be lazy or have some real fun
Let's get nuts. Let's spend some money
Take your shirt off honey
You'll be sorry Charlie
Rose colored glasses seem to be the rage
Let's get nuts. Let's spend some money
Take your shirt off honey
Let's get nuts. Let's spend some money
Take your shirt off honey
Give me something to define
I'm bending over backwards babe hoping that you'll say
Anything to keep me here
But you're pushing me away
Something just has to change
And I can't afford to question every time you show up late
I'm tired of always fighting babe
And you're pushing me away
You're just pushing me
Life is short and I'm all done crying
I've waited for you to be inspired
I'm bending over backwards babe hoping that you'll say
Just anything to keep me here
But you're pushing me away
You just keep pushing me
You're pushing me away
Don't let go I am only here for a moment
While we bask in the sweet divine of the moment
Tomorrow may not bring another chance to know the sweetness
Feel the warmth of our souls embrace for a moment
Rays of sunlight sparkle through the clouds
Melting all our doubts into this earth we tiptoe on so
So let us taste this meal that I've prepared with love for you
We are here to do what we're supposed to
Don't let go I am only here for a moment
This may be the last time we live such a moment
Don't let go I am only here for a moment
Could you open up your wallet
Now I've had my share of actors
And writers are a chore.
Now shower me with flowers
And buy me naughty things
The amazon could be so so hot or Paris in the spring...
Now the moral to the story is
Play your cards just right
And you won't be fooled by the playboy who'll just take you on a ride
Get your back against the wall
Put your hands up Mr. small
I am here to set you straight
I don't have time to argue your way
I'll give you one more chance to get yourself off
I'll give you one more chance to tell me why you can't
So now your beating to my drum
What's wrong sweet pea cats got your tongue
The more I begin to understand
The more I find you're such a bad man
I'll give you one more chance to come clean
Oh give me one more chance to orchestrate a plan
Oh you have too much fun breaking all the rules
Oh maybe so much fun I just might break them too
Take a moment to decide
Let's celebrate the art of dreaming
Let's come together for a change
So we can become one again
It's hot enough outside to burn my skin on the
Sidewalk with me a little longer
We shouldn't have to make believe that we live in harmony
Let's come together for a change
So we can become one again
Let's come together for a change
I think it's time we put our souls up on display
To everything we believe in
I live for every single day
Let's come together for a change
My advice would be that you take a bath
Wash off all that greed and those dirty deeds from your past.
You said that we were friends
An apple everyday won't be enough to keep Doctor away
You've made a mess of me and
I don't want to clean up
You've seemed to quench my appetite
I want to drink you sober
You're tasty as a cake
A recipe I long to taint
I want to drink you sober
Want you to be my lover
Oh no make no mistake
A victim to my every need
I want to drink you sober
Want you to be my lover
Need you to be my lover
How do I begin trying to explain
Yet you were always there to tell me it would be OK
Oh you're everything to me
Oh you're everything I need
Oh you're all that I am breathing in
I'll take a moment to recall the beauty that you are
Oh you're everything to me
Oh you're everything I need
Oh you're all that I am breathing in
There's nothing more I'd rather do than lay with you again
If only I could lay with you again
Oh you're everything to me
Oh you're everything I need
Oh you're all that I am breathing in
If I may just breathe you again
Dance with me across the ocean floor
Sail away to heaven's open doors
You're the next contestant
In this sweet charade
Wait while I twist your fate
Hold me close enough to drink my rose
The devil in my pocket turn to go
Who's the next contestant
In this sweet charade
Wait while I tease you say
So y'all listen close
It's not bright as the sun or sweet like sugar
So go up your nose with a finger or two
And pull out one or a crusty crew
Whether out in the open or on a sneak tip
But it weighed a good pound if you tried to weigh it
He sat there for a while with it in his hand
So I tried to play cool and like ignore the man
So I laid my head back to catch a quick a nap
All of a sudden he plucked it dead in my lap
Now Kane sat there laughing like it was all a joke
So I dug up my nose and pulled out about five
And plucked every last one of them dead in his eye
Like if I did something that was so full of shame
But yo you got to know the name of the game
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Back in public school with my partner Kane
And in the lunchroom you would talk about rude
God forbid the person that'd leave his food
No matter who you are we didn't give a damn
We even put teachers down with the program
Whether if it was a woman or if you a man
Catch anyone from anywhere
Now we're grown up and things have changed
I slipped a little green one inside his spaghetti
Let me tell you what happened to me with this girl...
I didn't show enough that I really did want it
But when she stepped in the light and she got real close
She was dressed real def and her body was hooked
I wanted to tell her about it but I couldn't be bold
But I'm here to talk about the Albee Square Mall
A place where people shop in downtown Brooklyn
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
I been to many malls from state to state
It's about time for the place to close
I get more respect than the average employee
Could work in every store in the mall
Because the place is my house from wall to wall
And any other shoppers that try to compare
There ain't no way they could hang out with Albee Square
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
I step in the place and shop around for a while
Go take a stroll inside of Gibb's Pups
Stroll around with a fly female
After that I go eat some food at Wendy's
Finally I step off all alone
Up to the top level to use the telephone
So I can reach out and touch everybody I know
That's where I be until the day is done
Because they're in the mood for me
I can turn it out without a doubt in any season
Say the funky rhyme to make the girls get naked
The magnificent record maker of Prism
In case you all forgot it it's called the Biz Dance
A movement by the body that's made like a puppet
Get up and move your body as I return
Well I'm here to show you like a dance that never dies
A movement of the body that can't be beat
It's like done by the creatures on Sesame Street
Like a ballerina that's drunk on Bacardi
And then you gotta throw your hand up to your head
And then your leg gotta hit your ear
And then your hand gotta hit your head
And your leg gotta hit your ear and jump
And this the way to do it
Kick your legs till the right is into the left
And if I dance with y'all I will revive it
I will make it come back like Sugar Ray
Means nobody wants to be there when you're down and out
Once you're established and got a lot of money
Everybody wanna be your buddy and honey
Like tall buildings they call skyscrapers
Is tell ya how to spread it throughout my crew
Back in the days before this began
He usually tried to talk to this girl name Fran
The type of female with fly Gucci wear
With big trunk jewelry and extensions in her hair
Since he wasn't no type of big drug dealer
But now he trucks gold and wears fly Valley boots
Rough leather fashions and tough silk suits
I got another partner that's calm and plain
He goes by the name of the Big Daddy Kane
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
I remember when he used to fight every day
And said he was the worst thing his mom's ever had
Now I got a cousin by the name of Von Lee
Well I remember when he first started to rock
And tried to get his job in a record shop
He was in it to win it but the boss fronted
Now my cousin Von still tried on and on and on
Till the like break of dawn
He walks into the same record shop as before
Damn it feels goo to see people up on it
Now guess what they caught from my cousin
Last subject of the story is about Biz Mark
I had to work for mine to put your body in park
They said no and treated me like a wet food stamp
When I used to come to parties they'd make me pay
I'd have to beg to get on the mike and rap that day
They acted like I wanted to keep it
But now things switched without belief
It happens all the time and never ceases to amaze
I'd like to... introduce myself
Rock from New York City all the way down South
Hey when I was a kid I used to play in the streets
It's a movement combination with your lip tongue and throat
Use your teeth and your nose for a mysterious high note
People treat me like a star and surround me in the mall
Anything than you want you gotta work hard for it
I even get big respect in my own neighborhood
Not gonna act conceited and say I'm the best
But I'm guaranteed to pass any kind of test
When I do the beat the party people go into HYSTERICS
Make the music... make the music
MAKE THE MUSIC... with your mouth
Make the music... make the music
MAKE THE MUSIC... with your mouth
Make the music... make the music
MAKE THE MUSIC... with your mouth
Make the music... make the music
MAKE THE MUSIC... with your mouth
MAKE THE MUSIC... with your mouth
I think the way I do it is so unique
By the way I move my hands hips legs and feet
But if you think that you can master it you got a fat chance
I'll explain at the moment how it should be done
Kick your legs till your pants almost rip
Then you know party people that you're halfway there
Now everybody out there that wanna learn the Biz Dance
And all the homeboys to one side
You should throw one leg to one side
And then throw the other leg up to the other side
Then throw your leg up above your head
I think the way I do it is so unique
By the way I move my hands hips legs and feet
But if you think that you can master it you got a fat chance
Now I know Fort Greene can do the Biz Dance
And Atlantic turtles can do the Biz Dance
And Astoria Projects can do the Biz Dance
Everybody on Farmers Boulevard can do the Biz Dance
You could either dance or just have a seat and
To all the party people that absorbs the info
And my record Make the Music will put you in a trance and
Down with the funky sound with yours truly
And I came to have fun and not be number one and
And everywhere that I perform and do a show
As long as you know that
I'm bound to wreck your body as they turn the party out
I'm the best person for this type of employment
On and on to the break of dawn
Or catch a sale retail before it gets stale
Reagan is the Pres but I voted for Shirley Chisholm
But in the end I'm sure that you will find it quite amusing
So respect the architect as I begin to build
Science and my reliance is upon my rap
You know nobody that beats the Biz
You know nobody that beats the Biz
I know nobody that beats the Biz
This is my version of the Nobel Peace Prize
That play all the hits on seven days
To all the disc jockey's that's on the go
I'd like to thank all the people state to state
Appreciate what you've done for me
So you can do the extra crazy Biz Mark dance too
Or even do the dance made up by yourself
Because you're the one that make the radio hype
Like fresh tobacco and a brand new pipe
A program director always pick the right hits
I ALWAYS look up to program directors
A couple of years ago when I didn't have a record player
I'm gonna make everything extra tough
Cause radio will last to infinity
Yo I'd just like to say it like this
So check him out without a doubt and you will agree
For when he cut the funky records he won't be disappear
He's highly recognized as the DJ of disco
Here's a biography about my DJ
I think I like the way that he cuts for me
He rocks from here all the way to the Bell forum
This is dedicated to you
So you wanna spread a lot of talk about my city Milwaukee huh
All that talk about Laverne and Shirley
Now we had to shout y'all down
We gonna go get the 4-4
Oh act like you didn't know
Betta not bring your ass around my city
It's where the thugs stay and drugs lay
But hungry hoes will pack your shit and turn some tricks
If money drop like the spot then you can't leave till the last boulder
So if we don't see you at the top
Top of the charts with this hardest rap
Ain't been to the city in awhile
Now we had to shout y'all down
We'll have to go and get the 4-4
Oh act like y'all didn't know
Love my city these streets remind me
Ain't been to the city in awhile
Now we had to shout y'all down
We'll have to go and get the 4-4
Oh act like y'all didn't know
Ain't been to the city in awhile
Now we had to shout y'all down
We'll have to go and get the 4-4
Oh act like y'all didn't know
Yo... this is kinda slow
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house
Well that's not the subject matter of to be cool
I always reminisce when I was in class well
It's just as good as one bad suspension
To them high school is like a three year bid
Until the principal straight got in my ass
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house
Now this is the second part of this lesson
You don't have to go to high school to be an MC
It's not like I'm your mother sister brother or pop
So come on and listen to me without no doubt
Don't become a drug addict or alcoholic
Because it will mess with your mind and brain
And only thing you wanna do is fiend and complain
Now this is a difficult subject
They know they have something that people don't like
And they still continue to disrespect
A foreign fragrance with a presence
That you can't see with the naked eye
But to the nose it's a nuisance
And it will sneak upon you like espionage
You might not know it cause it won't show it
And you will swear it's just a mirage
With a bit of a twang it got its own slang
From here to the Himalayan
I think I should go more into depth
About a secret that is quiet as kept
Godliness is cleanliness
But if you think I'm misguiding you
That bothers everybody when you're at a party
It could be the beverage you guzzle
But if you listen to me
Before you give somebody a kiss
You get a crazy whiff
He was one of them kids from like around the block
Even if he would shower and shower
He would always wanna like hang around
His underarms had bass with scents around
Don't you like when the winter's gone
Besides all that I like the warm weather
Cause that's when you can get yourself together
But I like Easter time with a grin
We used to eat a lot of stuff like cotton candy
You used to get dressed up in double knits
Everybody know it's spring again
To the girls and boys and people above
This is the time to fall in love
He beg for your forgiveness and you know what that brings
Joy and happiness into your life
Before you felt like your heart was stabbed by a knife
You know two wrongs don't make a right
And if he did something wrong don't do the same it's not polite
And wanted you to act like you was on the hunt
I used to see my homeboys frown and fret
I know I caught it myself I must admit
And said anything you want you gotta work hard for it
They're really owning yours like a pair of drawers
They want you to be like Santa Claus
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
But you say he's just a friend
A relationship or some understanding
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
The tour was over and she went back to school
But you say he's just a friend
So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
I arrived in front of the dormitory
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend
I once knew a girl by the name of Monique
She was my childhood sweetheart every day of the week
We both lived in Colonial Projects
We was more closer than a hand and glove
This is what you call real puppy love
I wouldn't miss her more than I'd miss all of my friends
Even though we was little this love was unique
Even though we was little she had a physique
Indian brown skin with a nice complexion
She always gave me tender love and affection
I knew she was different in her own little way
I used to knock at her door bout every single day
Crazy big variety of a lot of candy
She would share it with her friends Kim Ron and Fran and
That's why me and her got along so good
Now this is the epilogue of this story
No matter how many years ago I can't forget
But then again 1986 hit
I didn't see her again until 1988
Now this time I had enough courage to speak to her
Yo that's the... that's that joint
It's an animated dance for my employment
You might remember him from Saturday afternoon
He was my favorite character on any cartoon
I just want everybody to listen to the funky beat
I been in this studio for about a month
At the boards my man Paul Sea
But this goes out to my man Danny Dan
The beat man that makes you understand
It would take for the next thing to go wrong
I told myself you would never know what you might find
Happened to look across the room and somebody winked
I did the only thing the Diabolical could do
Looked down to see what that I was attached to
Her hair and eyes sparkled like ginger ale
I stepped to the lady and tapped her arm
She didn't look none like she looked across the room
Had hair on her chest longer than King Spade
And that's the last I ever saw of Kim
You go on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Whether it's at a club or a block party
The title of the song in the place to be
I think it's time to act up and throw a fit
The name of a baseball glove is a mitt
And what I need on my BMW is a kit
A preacher preaches from a pulpit
The rhymes that I say are the ultimate
And the way out anywhere is called an exit
A real short play is called a skit
And New Balance sneakers are legit
I used to live by the North conduit
This is a different kind of rhythm and rap display
I'm bound to wreck your body to the break of day
Always been down with the capital J
I got a homeboy by the name of Dr. Bombay
I can't forget I like reggae
Everywhere I go I like break your way
The king of romance will like break your day
And my favorite drink is called OJ
I rock to the rhythm and oh say okay
The original with the material and the ladies always know
Known to me as the original B
It don't matter long as I say stuff you see
This is a different type of dedication
To a guy that was a different kind of inspiration
Around Suffolk he wasn't known
We'd try to get a job everyplace that it takes
Everywhere we went they said they'd call us back
Still Rich didn't give up the faith
He found a job that wasn't safe
That's why this is dedicated to my man Rich
Yo this is to you my man Rich
I wish upon a star that it didn't have to be
His dream was... to be a boxer
And this goes out to my DJ
It's a different kind of sound that's in the air
A sample from a record that's a four bar measure
Adults think this music is just a big headache
Cause back in the days when there was just block parties
We won awards and served them by the millions
With more and more groups that have finesse
We have groups on the East and West coast with different names
We all play a part if we didn't we'd go in flames
We all got to stick together as one
Cause you don't wanna lose the love for the music
The diabolical is back again
And we gonna do it in harmony like this
The best in New York city
So let us put it to perfection
While we change it to the Biz Mark connection
Other crews in this section always try to ban the connection
They got together and they combined
Tried to hurt us from time to time
But it didn't work... as you see
The Biz Mark is in the place to be
I'm gonna take your girl with my sweet kiss
I got the power to get you up off the wall
The cut master Cool V
He is the man that's at the top of the key
Of course he is fast you know that he is slick
To my man Marcus from Kansas City
With three subjects like this...
Subject one is about a brother by the name of John
Because that's no longer what my man John does
The lifestyle he lived was far from penny ante
But then the day came when John got caught
And he was dropped like pantyhose without support
Things get a little easier
Once you learn to understand it
A messed up story about a girl named Suzy
Make blunts disappear better than a magician
Grabbed her pipe and sung a song
She'd go out buy a nice rock just to suit her
Put it all together for a perfect combination
I mean this girl would actually buy a rock with
The very last dime she got in her pocket
I mean this girl was blessed with an overdose
My friend... we thought they'd never end
But then she got on drugs
And let me tell you what say happened to Marie
As for money she don't have a dime to claim
Because when I saw the girl the other day
This is a incident that always occur
No matter what nationality color or creed
It's no reason why I shouldn't try to mingle
So I met this girl by the name of Maxine
Her breath didn't stink she used Listerine
But this situation was one of a kind
Because I wanted her... all to my own
Just check out what the heck I got to say
Determined like a German like a head is to a hat
I never treat people like they were fleas
But if you think that I got a big head though
What comes around goes around
It started freshman year and lasted straight to the 12th grade
About me that made me treat me like a buzzard
I speak to you in the hall and you ignore me
You call me out my name and crack jokes on my school clothes
But you give me that look like you don't wanna be bothered
Now everywhere you go everybody knows me
And you make it your duty to come and speak to me
And we can start off with all the men you been with
The word's around town that you're on the money tip
And over to the bar because that's what I came for
She whispers in my ear could she come home with me
What comes around goes around
What comes around goes around
What comes around goes around
Maybe he went to get some roses for you
Let me tell you what I hear most people say
That you two people are a part of life
It explains why Romeo died by the knife
Or vice versa I don't know it make my mind flips
And if you hear the music you could never go wrong
I would walk into the bathroom to take a crap
Whether I'm constipated or have diarrhea
I always come out with a funky fresh idea
Cause a lot of my hits are written on the john
I hope my legendary style of rap lives on
Only in there I am the king of the throne
That's the only way that I can get privacy
Let me tell you a little something bout this episode
I think I would name this one Make The Music
Like if I was the man that they call Clark Kent
Then I come out on stage like Superman
A TV in the bathroom just might spoil it
Only thing I can say is...
She was one of the baddest in the universe
She start the conversation over how was your weekend
I did this that and the other with my friend Monique
So I gave her two hours then I called her back
This is for those who didn't believe
My goal or even get to my destiny
Career in rap to make you say hallelujah
I knew you was gonna make hits someday
A peep of help from them was never heard
No matter how much beef and aggravation I take it
And if you try to hold back me and my crew
I used to go to block parties my cousin had served
And then I said if I was in their spotlight
It was me and Mike from Ike and then they used to do it
He said if you wanna be like them you gotta keep to it
Or virtually impossible for me to succeed
You must be crazy if I wouldn't pursue
Only thing that I can tell you is I told you...
I said to Ty if you let me come out with a cut
I got international like twin skyscrapers
Altogether it was one point five records sold
So don't EVER try to hold back me and my crew
Hey I'd like to tell you a little story
About my man named Dee
He was like kinda on a tough tip
... It should really go like...
... The way he would say it now check this out
But man without a plan all he had was hopes
So he start to flip and cut class with the big boys
He'd rather run the block and watch the hustlers play
But never did the thought even pass
When he was only eight he hung out with the pros
I think you will understand a little bit more of the situation
Way back WHEN... when he was only ten
Tried to stay rich to keep him and his bitch paid
And if he ever had to travel somewhere far
He'd always choose to live his life the wild way
His moms and pops told him when he first reached Junior High
The way you live determine just how soon you die
And he didn't care because to him it was fun
And he was only THIRTEEN when he got his first gun
Gave a new name to juvenile delinquency
But he was headed for a dead end fast
Went back and forth to jail six times
For all the kids out there you know now
The Grand High Exalted Mystic Ruler
Who used to wear his pants up to his chest
And I want you to just listen
Once about a time there was a kid
Who didn't have a bicycle or a car that skid
Only thing he had was Pat and Turner
Way to get started in the music biz
Just listen to the story as I tell it like it is
I was a youngster from East Junior High School
I wanted to be down really really bad so
He had one by the name of Masters of Control
I went home and sat in the room with no lights in the dark
And this is gonna be a rough rendezvous
Yo B take it from the top
Yo B take it from the top
You might have seen in some videos with other folks
I scoop girls around the world that's what B does
The name Backspin means that B was
I say peace to Chancellor Avenue and Bergen Street
Yo Cap take it from the top
Yo Cap take it from the top
Together it's combined and designed to a master rhyme
A little touch from Cool V himself
An overnight process then it's ready for the shelves
Perfect shit on wax is made
Then bring it to the radio and let it get played
There's no joke and only time to get fanatical
So listen up or pay attention to the Capital
Yo Shell take it from the top
Yo Shell take it from the top
Like to the I say with the A and hey
It's always def and different
The Diamond Shell will never trip stagger fall or bend
I don't smoke and never ever have I drank no liquor
As I tour from Kalamazoo to the moon
Yo Fell take it from the top
Yo Fell take it from the top
Ready for the riot I rip rap rapacious
Hard to handle run a gamble like Vegas
Rappers crumble when I tackle they crackle I ramshackle
Days from a faze and my praise is like a rajah
Think life is a game and they just too pissed to play
Effects who's next I wreck from now till then
It don't matter to me cause you know that I'm connected
That's why you like everything I create
That's just some of the things you can comprehend
At this moment I had to swallow my pride
Cause usually I wouldn't ask for a lift
Not at one time did homeboy look back
I had nobody to help me as you can see...
I did a lot of funky beats without no doubt
Massive people come to me for my autograph
After the funk was over it was time to break
I got my man Craig Craig in the house
Kevin Dee from Midnight Express Crew's in the house
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
I got a friend by the name of Charlie
Charlie got a wife by the name of Dolly
Dolly and Charlie got a son named Wally
And Wally got a girl by the name of Polly
Polly got a sister by the name of Molly
Molly and Polly got a mother named Holly
You don't understand and I'm very very sorry
He's married to my fine Aunt Rita
Of the family I'm a favorite choice
Now he got a girl by the name of Mona
Now that Homer's marries to Mona
All he does all day is bone bone bone her
Cause the one she used before made her underarms sore
Known her ever since who knows when
Of family and friends of Grandpa Ben
Like this like that like that like this
You know the Biz Mark's on top of the list
Yo I would not rely on Noah
With the rhyme of the MC time
Down to wreck your body and on the scene
And make all your girls shake your butt
The lesson with the rhyme of a MC time
Is it because I'm Biz and I'm in a room
I shakes from scripts of hits I made a while ago
Now I'm on the run again starting other capers
Cause me without big strong thoughts for a Biz song
I don't give a damn if my record gets panned
Cause my style stays fresh like I rap in Saran
Suppose when I write my rhymes like I'm the Big Apple
So don't try to stalk cause my style brings more
From junior high to high school they thought I was retarded
I was very very sad and you wonder why
Because my looks and my gear wasn't ultra fly
I wouldn't even attempt to ask a girl out
But my parents told me beauty's only skin deep
I even joined the football team to get some recognition
But that didn't spark the key in a girl's ignition
So I kick this to all the girls from houses to huts
I'm a tell you story that's really bugged
About a guy with a Benz and he's dealing drugs
In the beginning before he got his riches
I used to crack and joke and say he looked like a star
I can't laugh now because it's a new decade
Behind your back they talk about you say you're ugly and you front
Why do you go to bed with someone that you don't like
Just because they got a nice car like Reverend Ike
It would be wrong if he heard what you're thinking
And this is what he whispered in my ear to me
Let me tell you how poor I was
Now people always ask how are these things known
Cause the dome does the doing for things that are done at home
I get cheap and go settle for the White Castle bargain
They offer me a lot in the army
But I'd rather get it second hand from the Salvation Army
Cause times are getting harder than boot camp
Man I'm so poor I need to print my face on a food stamp
So I keep clear thoughts as the weeks run
But for now I'm just going to do the strut
And this is what I say to girls from houses to huts
She had a pair of jugs that was so fine
Then I took a look at that behind
I got her digits and gave her my 1-800 beeper number
With this girl if I knew she was an adolescent
I got a strange message on my 1-800 beeper
But I got a good message from a girl named Rum
Come and get me from Mickey D's at 8
I was so excited that she called my pager
But never thought to ask if she was a teenager
You wouldn't believe or even think of
A bird like that could be a dove
I picked her up in my Lexus coupe
Now I was seeing her for about half a year
Everything was fine and dandy without shedding a tear
Okay then why don't you get that through the judge's head
It was coming very close to her birthday
I never knew what an avalanche the future brings
Her birthday came and she gave a party
I arrive kind of late to the place to be
People was excited for seeing my face
If my mother ever knew I would be a disgrace
I felt like falling apart when I heard the news
Charlie got a wife by the name of dolly
Polly got a sister by the name of molly
You don't understand then I'm very very sorry
Who is the leader of the married cheaters
Of the family I'm a favorite choice
Cause the one she used before made her underarm sore
Asked me was I ready for us to go steady
Known her ever since who knows when
Bound to wreck your body
To my man DJ Hollywood
Because he was one of the first ones out there
A little something like this
For you to stop me now
I'm the kind of guy that could really turn you on
Just hold me close and hold me tight
And let's make love tonight
Did you ever look into her eyes and see a little prayer
One day you'll be happy
But that next day you'll be blue
Say LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME
Say LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME
Whenever we're up close
Say LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME
When all the other fellas try to run that game on you
I wanna show you baby a love that's true
Let me... let me turn you on
We gonna give love to
To be or not to be a celebrity
Women and men that borrow and lend
And all the children that try to pretend
Now my man Michael loves to eat cycle
Crazy wings off the gravy train
But it ain't a place to be without me me me
This goes out to my man Sweet G from The Fever
Unique and the Mega Audio Crew
And Willie got the good food up there with him
And Mike and God Build and the whole Rolls International Posse
And the whole Queens Posse like my man Big D
Now people always want to know my strategy plan
I write rhymes that jam more than jelly
I grab the microphone and go every which way but loose
And I don't be using flipping tongue twisters
But I still get better in time like The Whispers
But older crews you see can't stay as loose as me
Cause old school rappers just ain't what they used to be
So up your nose with a rubber hose
And every brother knows that your style's older than my grandma's clothes
Heard it was a kid across town named Hector
Met me at the door with a kiss and a smile
Just show me to your room so we can do this in a hurry
Kissed her from her earlobes down to her chest
Went for the bellybutton and to hell with the rest
BOOM with the left and his fronts hit the floor
Now everybody better be gone by the count of one
Honey looked good and yo the buns was fat
Let me tell you a story now
I was in front of the Apollo on Amateur Night
My John Hancock or my signature
And plus the Apollo is my home turf
I saw this pair of shoes that was really live
She turned around slowly and started to stare
I can do bad by myself
I can do bad by myself
Because I have a mother and father that take care of me
She asked me why I am so stingy I know you got the ends
She want me to waste everything and be small as an elf
I can do bad by myself
I can do that on my own
I can do bad by myself
I knew she had a boyfriend on the side
She said she cut him because he was too jealous
She tried to seduce me in every way
She would come out to Jersey rain sleet or snow
She acted too true blue to be after my dough
Guaranteed to rock and make the microphone sing
But every time that I always hit a note
But let me tell you that my name is the
Got good luck like Lucky Charms leprechaun
Not number one but here to have fun
Guaranteed to proceed and get the job done
Funky funky fresh from the day I begun
My favorite team is the Vikings when I watch football
Here's another one to get you off the wall
Soon to be elected in the Hall of Fame
She couldn't believe what I had achieved
When I put the party people in a state of shock
Dog in the house like I'm Spuds McKenzie
I'm not dumb so don't be misled
Always listened to what my moms and pops said
Got a big belly so you know I'm well fed
Drop a three pointer from the corner like swish
Walk around with a name belt and a funky new rap
Shell tops new and Space Invaders cap
Me and Monty roll together like Fred and Grady
Just like Martin Luther I had a dream
I'm the best thing out now go ask your moms
Want the tie within coats with no liner
Make any party hot like your sauna
Still keep the crowd controlled with no drama
So listen to the way I rock the spot
The Diabolical came to get the job done
Each and every time I know what to say
East West Midwest and the Dirty South
I'm glad to be right here with y'all
Let me see you bounce
Let me see you bounce
That I took the S off Superman's chest
I hope you understand the rhyme I express
Cause you know that the Biz always pass his tests
You gotta admit that the rhymes are fresh
Right about now I gotta take recess
So shake it baby just shake it baby
Never listen to what haters say
Never got drunk and never got blunted
The beat don't stop till everybody's gone
I don't know what you came to do
I came to rock the house for you
Chicks cling on me like ballerina tights
Like Minnie Mouse and Courageous Cat
I'd like to tell a story and it goes like this
You will agree without a reasonable doubt
This is one you'll like when it's done
Only certain people know about Union Square
Grandmaster Vic had a different sound
Mr. Magic and Marley gave radio a lift
As I tell the story of this beautiful day
There was a lot of clothes that was fly
Guess jeans and others that's acid washed
African clothes and medallions was worn
He goes by the name of the Dapper Dan
Now the dances was crazy to match
The way the Gucci Girls gave shows a spark
You can't beat that with a baseball bat
And you'd never see me without my Biz Mark hat
I saw this girl from like around the way
If I met her whole family I would kiss her dad
She got a good head on her shoulder and she's no dummy
But she bugged me out so bad I was on the ropes
Because when I reached out for a kiss and hug
And said this question
I thought she really really liked me
She had her own car so I walked her to the door
And she said just like this
So I don't know why she'd wanna treat me this way
So the next time I saw her she was unhappy
She had a frown on her face and real jumpy
The way she looked her life had took a real turn
So come on Diabolical
Don't stop and don't you dare quit
Affects a lot of people in the strangest way
And I never miss a tag when it's my turn
Whack rappers get dropped like a hot potato
The only MC in history
Got took to court and didn't need a lawyer
Went to Fort Knox and kicked down the door
Rocked seven continents with all this flow
With the rhythm and rhymes and style that I display
I got out of breath and almost caught emphysema
Put the party people in a state of shock
While Biz compose songs like Sebastian Bach
This is the end of this scenario
Is it because I put the party people into shock
I think it's because I am the original B
On the guitar is my man Monty
But every time you hear me I am on the go
This is a story about without a doubt
They always say time is on our side
If I could save time or return to the past
Back when Ra was still with Eric B
We listened to what other enemies said
Where I could turn back the hands of time
Where I could turn back the hands of time
On Labor Day on the Beach in Virginia
If it was up to me and I could turn back the clock
If I can turn back the hands of time
If I could turn time back in a rhyme
And your character and real personality
If I can turn back the hands of time
I really want to put you under my wing
But every time I try you give me a hard time
I try to do everything right for you
You need to marinate on this for a while
Now let me tell you like this baby doll
I never guessed you would act off the wall
Give me a chance for a little romance
We can dance and dine in Jamaica or France
Some people got time to play them games
Fans nibble on me like corn on the cob
Because I love you more than human eyes can see
I don't know why you give me real rough times
You bring me joy like Mary J.
I wanna do the same thing to you every day
I'm so unforgettable like Archie Bunker
Never liked Lucy and I beat Little Ricky
I put the party people in a state of shock
With the with the whoa quick unpredictable
And it goes like this
The incredible unforgettable B
Cause you can probably find me anywhere
You better grab a seat because you're gonna be here for a while
As the Diabolical tell you the deal
When you see the crowd go crazy you will say I'm outrageous
I do all the hot joints like Eddie Murphy and will flip it
Still get down and dirty in Newark and Elizabeth
Now I graduated with DJ love
July 4th and Labor Day in Virginia was hot
Cause Biggie Smalls and Teddy Riley was in the spot
Now that Biz Mark's inside the joint
Guaranteed to rock and always prove a point
About the Prince of Boogie and the Master of Fun
My rap technique is most very unique
People gather round me like I'm Pope John Paul
We can't party like it's 1999 no more
And act like you don't have a care in the world
Inhuman Orchestra that you would prefer
Only thing to say is I'm spectacular
Let me get busy so I can make you dance
Shake and bake and put you in a trance
Make you forget all your stress for five minutes or less
Like a vacation in Jamaica or France
I don't gotta bald head
But I'm guaranteed to rock and spread love
Super educated from above
MC guaranteed to hold you just like a glove
Y'all know how this goes down
I know it's been a long time since you heard me
But right about now in 2003
I gotta make one to rock the party
As I change back from DJ to MC
My style is really outrageous
And when you hear the song it's really contagious
But it will make you go out like gorillas in cages
I used to sing songs myself but now I can't
I need the party people to help with this chant
But since I live in Washington I'm Redskin like Levon
They gonna rock your body all night long
Listen to the brother with the rhythm rhymes I display
That's why a lot of emcees wanna see
If I'm gonna fall off but I'm not G
I'm guaranteed to go all night with rhymes I write
So listen as I take a breather
The gas from the past of the American friend
With your suits and your squads and your fancy car
When I flow people gotta see the whole Ricki Lake
I like Spike Lee's a kind of sporty 40 Acre
When you first heard me I did MEOW MEOW
Guaranteed to rock and shock and clock and
Is it because I'm like smart like Mr. Spock and
From the glass clear era that's the point of the one
I check them then wreck them let them fall into my spectrum
I become monolithic then rip it the remains I sip it
Yo 6 o'clock every morning you waking up yawning
To the sound of your alarm clock alarm
About an hour from now
You should be at the place of employment
It affects your occupational performance
You wonder why your work load is so enormous
Because your boss just laid off three quarters of the whole office
From the stress that the corporate environment causes
Regardless of how you ultimately wanna solve this
You could take a new job offer for more chips
Stick it out a little longer or forfeit
But my advice to anybody that wants to quit
Take this job and shove it
Take this job and shove it
Take this job and shove it
Put your middle finger up slowly
Put it close enough to his face so he can examine it closely
Tell your spouse what happened and where you are
So they can come and get you in the car later on
And help you search for a new 9 to 5 job
If the unemployment line ain't that long
But if you hate it all you gotta do is get mad and tell the boss to
Take this job and shove it
Take this job and shove it
Take this job and shove it
The boss is favored and get placed in something spacious
While the most hated get placed in some small cubicle spaces
Twelve months passed by and you still ain't get paid yet
Here's a optimistic motto
If you ever late for today you could say you early for tomorrow
Cause the description in the job ain't no picnic in the park
Drink coffee to stay wired
Take this job and shove it
Take this job and shove it
Take this job and shove it
Take this job and shove it
Take this job and shove it
On the week days I be in school
I don't do a thing till my grace is said
And think off all the fly girls in my class
Pay off the don say it can't hurt
I pull on my Lee's and my blue sweat shirt
Walk around the corner seem to catch the bus
And if the bus ain't there I don't dare fuss
Just tell mama I'm Mister bust a day
And she take me to school in a white OJ
But when I get to the school and the bell ring
I don't even worry cause it ain't no thing
Walk in the room they say you're late for class
You know the teachers is gonna listen to me
It's a real thing while I hold my hands on this microphone
I leave you all in a daze
Get it for all days my broke cup pawn flows
Me and Superman we had a fight
I punched him in the face for all my might
Punched him so hard he fell to the floor
She took my hand and led me to the room
We smoked three joints and cracked the core of the brew
I looked her up I thought she was fine
We took off the clothes and clicked off the light
When it came to the break of day
That's one thing I couldn't refuse
At around eight I kissed her goodbye
I woke up in the morning with my hand on my head
The way this day turned out wasn't my prerogative
I went to the kitchen to get some cereal smooth as silk
I just grab a cup of juice and be on my way
They took my radio and my favorite cassette
To begin this era of grief and aggravation
I was parked by a meter and still got a citation
A cop pulled behind me at a red light
Guess what happened to me before I could blink
After all that I could finally go home
And rest my feet and get on the telephone
I had a unbelievable time in the city
I tried to cook some dinner but it came out burnt
She ate all the food and drank all of the liquor
I better bring her home so I can stick her
So I got her to my house as fast as I can
The spotlight's hitting something
That has known to change the weather
You know I read it in a magazine
But Bennie makes them ageless
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong
You know I read it in a magazine
I think the way I do it is so unique
By the way I move my hands hips legs and feet
But if you think that you can master it you got a fat chance
I'll explain at the moment how it should be done
Kick your legs till your pants almost rip
Then you know party people that you're halfway there
Now everybody out there that wanna learn the Biz Dance
And all the homeboys to one side
You should throw one leg to one side
And then throw the other leg up to the other side
Then throw your leg up above your head
I think the way I do it is so unique
By the way I move my hands hips legs and feet
But if you think that you can master it you got a fat chance
Now I know Fort Greene can do the Biz Dance
And Atlantic turtles can do the Biz Dance
And Astoria Projects can do the Biz Dance
Everybody on Farmers Boulevard can do the Biz Dance
But I was wide oped off you
The unforgettable incredible B
I got more rhymes than Muhammad Ali
The way I get down you'll say
Cause you can probably find me anywhere
I am old school like a permanent crease
You better grab a Snickers cause you gonna be here for a while
As the Diabolical just tell ya the deal
I did the Tunnel with Flex and caught L in Patterson
Now I graduated with DJ Love
So the transition from rapper to DJ wasn't smooth
July 4th and Labor Day in Virginia was hot
Cause Biggie Smalls and Teddy Riley was in the spot
From the relays to all the Greek picnics
To all the girls in g strings and thongs
I got so much on my mind like my name was Chuck D
When the crowds see me go crazy they think I'm outrageous
First Fridays from Philly to the Lou
Even go across seas to London and Tokyo
As we take you Uptown
Once again it's Mr. Diabolical
And to that girl I met when I was in Texas
I like to get to know ya
I like to get to know ya
And all the other girls that I might have missed
I like to get to know ya
If you don't know what a dime is
This goes out to all the beautiful ladies out there
And to all the ladies
If we didn't you get you on this version
We got you on the remix
We got Big Daddy Kane over there
We all gonna do just one part
What all the racial war for
I walk through a color blind corridor
So let's form a rainbow over the mountain
And let's drink from the same water fountain
Let's make our Earth Day a story of
People that walk through the same territories
Then I see your family tree was uprooted
So don't be foolish if you're Jewish or Hindu
The racial manual is the evil that men do
I was raised in a nation of Asian
Hate shouldn't separate Jamaican from Haitian
I bring a rattle to a battle that you see me in
My nationality's reality
And yo a prejudiced man is of a devil mentality
Take a taste and erase the racism
Together we learn how to read and write
We got Big Daddy Kane over there
We all gonna do just one part
What all the racial war for
I walk through a color blind corridor
So let's form a rainbow over the mountain
And let's drink from the same water fountain
Let's make our Earth Day a story of
People that walk through the same territories
Then I see your family tree was uprooted
So don't be foolish if you're Jewish or Hindu
The racial manual is the evil that men do
I was raised in a nation of Asian
Hate shouldn't separate Jamaican from Haitian
I bring a rattle to a battle that you see me in
My nationality's reality
And yo a prejudiced man is of a devil mentality
Take a taste and erase the racism
Together we learn how to read and write
In the days of slavery
Some got to run away and many got done away
Inferiority is what some men say
Then again in the streets of New York
We got to better this world of prejudice
You better believe that I'm an Asiatic descendant
And I know what's been amended and intended
I know there's different strokes for different folks
But I've also acknowledged what hatred provokes
So don't hate me or try to underrate me
And we can all live together in harmony
If I'm a slave I'm a slave to the rhythm
To the black and the white
The red and the yellow
To all the nationalities
I'd like to say hello
In the days of slavery
Some got to run away and many got done away
Inferiority is what some men say
Then again in the streets of New York
We got to better this world of prejudice
You better believe that I'm an Asiatic descendant
And I know what's been amended and intended
I know there's different strokes for different folks
But I've also acknowledged what hatred provokes
So don't hate me or try to underrate me
And we can all live together in harmony
If I'm a slave I'm a slave to the rhythm
To the black and the white
The red and the yellow
To all the nationalities
I'd like to say hello
Now this is a difficult subject
They know they have something that people don't like
And they still continue to disrespect
A foreign fragrance with a presence
That you can't see with the naked eye
But to the nose it's a nuisance
And it will sneak upon you like espionage
You might not know it cause it won't show it
And you will swear it's just a mirage
With a bit of a twang it got it's own slang
I think I should go more into depth
About a secret that is quiet as kept
Godliness is cleanliness
But if you think I'm misguiding you
That bothers everybody when you're at a party
It could be the beverage you guzzle
But if you listen to me
Before you give somebody a kiss
You get a crazy whiff
He was one of them kids from like around the block
Even if he would shower and shower
He would always wanna like hang around
His underarms had bass with scents around
If you don't rock with me you won't rock at all
I'm guaranteed to rock and turn the party out
Like a Saturday night at the Audubon
Be I Z M A are K I out with the E
I'm guaranteed to rock and turn the party out
We came here to do the motherfucking do
Got my man Marley Marl in the house
Juice Crew in the house
And we gonna rock a little something like this
Tour from New York to South Dakota
Drink ginger ale or root beer soda
Never get the girls with the underarm odor
Once knew a girl by the name of Rhoda
I watched Star Wars just to see Yoda
Maybe Commando or the Terminator
To me getting paid and getting busy fall together
That I be using and not many can manage
Giving party people something funky to listen to
I stomp them out just like I was King Kong
I go on and on and on and
Until the bright Shirley Murdock morning
Never use a barbershop I got my homeboy Smooth
Cooling out with the clippers right around the way
To keep my fresh Cameo cut every day
The verdict that I reach for you is rather blurry
But my rhymes will remain like a hieroglyphic
It's a certain special skill that takes much practice
Let me show you exactly how it's properly done
This goes out to all the beautiful ladies
And just for that I wanna thank you a lot
Every time I see ya in my neighborhood
My crew bugs out when they're in the party
Instead of baby got back baby got body
This goes out to my people who know how I feel
I know you will agree without a reasonable doubt
Now let me tell you a story about a girl named Judy
The only reason I changed my mind is because...
I came across a girl by the name of Liz
Hourglass shape that made me go ape
And you know the other reason why is because...
When I walk through the club what do I see
I wanna look in your eye
When I walk through the club what do I see
Get down for a minute and get all up in my mix
Let me tell you how I been tight with Mic since kid
We go back like corn rows perform shows
We did it independent but then we went in bend it
How you thing I got watch and drive this car
What would I be without my
What would I be without my
What would I be without my
How could I be without my
Who would I be without my
What would I be without my
What would I be without my
How could I be without my
If I was Darth Vader he's like my light saber
If was Mike Jordan he'd be my ball
And like Mike Jackson we off the wall
And like Mike Tyson we can't be beat
Keep out of beef and plenty of fights
When ever brother got a grudge I call Mic
When ever crowd won't budge I call Mic
Said don't the club all right call Mic
What would I be without my
What would I be without my
What would I be without my
How could I be without my
Who would I be without my
What would I be without my
What would I be without my
How could I be without my
So now that y'all know that Mic is my man
In fact we so tight I keep it throw in my hand
For real we responsible for all these grands
All these thank you letters from all these fans
That's they we suppose to do
He have my back and I have his
They could call him uncle Mic if I have kids for real
What would I be without my
What would I be without my
What would I be without my
How could I be without my
Who would I be without my
What would I be without my
What would I be without my
How could I be without my
You could either dance or just have a seat and
And everywhere that I perform and do a show
I'm guaranteed to rock I make the ladies scream and shout
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I got the stutter step to keep in check my speed is so unique
But in the end I'm sure that you will find it quite amusing
Science and my reliance is upon my rap
You know nobody that beats the Biz
I know nobody that beats the Biz
I burn while the tables turn like windmills
With lyrics that came from the brain of Mark Twain
So if you can't handle the man please go and change the channel
People run inside the cellars
As I teach you're attached to my rhyme like a leash
Take the P off the peach because now you want each
And every rhyme to teach and reach
Some got shook when they took a look
You get defeated decapitated captivated
Sonny you're funny like Johnny Carson
These rhymes here can kill son
Too dope of a type windpipe full of hype
And I sideswipe the suckers I snipe
Chumps are caught in the blaze and dumped in ashtrays
Plus your name's unlisted
Your brainstorms don't even drizzle
You get sunken when I hit a punk and
We're getting down to the funky sounds
That rock the microphone most definitely
Bringing you styles that you never heard
I got funky rhymes to blow your mind
When I'm in San Francisco or when I'm local
I'm guaranteed to rock and make the microphone sing
In the tune I can croon with a bang and a boom
So hurry up and get the six smokers out the room
Before I catch Asthma or Emphysema
But it don't matter now like Purina cat chow
Its almost ten years since I rocked at the quarters
When I count to three everybody say peace
I predict more downfall than Sly Stone's moms
Shit is fucked up and it gets worse everyday
Show no shame when you're caught up in this game
Cause in this trade you're full of tricks and surprises
Steal a bone from a dog and your cap get peeled
I got your mind wide open and your wig pushed back
When in disguise I'm a shadow with red eyes
Life's a scramble with scars and scrapes
You better premeditate for the moves and shake
You get moved on and get that ass torn
Maintain but never strain flow with the grain
Who's next to get they neck broke
Protect what's mines and then I take what's yours
During the day rap assassin
My actions gotta speak louder than words
3 deadly elements out for the fortune
The way I choose to live my life is irrelevant
You can't fuck with the foundation
And we both know that we about to fuck
I still keep my money in a rubber band
You want me you can find me wherever that you hang
Hat to the right on sight wherever I go
And realize ain't none a y'all as hood as me.
Now release neither one of us to catch a murder case
Now you grieve over your son what the fuck
Maybe we can reconcile when I'm gone.
Got the picture of the seven little reasons
You ain't had to live like I did
Hell I even did a bid and came back to see
The only reason I ain't kill myself
You got the demons that's within myself
One day we'll ball and I'll never have to leave again
I ride with y'all everywhere cause y'all are part of me
I make my money off of dicks and spend it on my kids
They the ones I look to whenever I'm in danger
Walk through the door with my hands on a gun
Maybe I just feel like there's too many pussies in rap
I love the finger snaps and the claps into the song
Who walk around with their chest out
I already seen two friends get shot in the head
Or just cry like a bitch while I lay in my grave
And give me the spot best of all time
Most rap guys wanna die for the fame.
And fear man is one thing that he don't feel
Recognize a situation that you can't win
You may feel like a marked mellow but you can live
It's better not to be brash and come with foolishness
You probably somewhere
When will a hater learn
I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner
Send weight to the coroner
Continue to walk this earth's surface
Branch out my services
I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's
On another rapper's dick
Go on represent where you live
But don't make the mistake
And park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive
Shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst
And what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets
Dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse
A part of my heart is gone
I could never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy
It'll take awhile to tame
But the dozen can fix it
Resist and the biscuit will exceed the distance
And bounce off one's home
Hit and ricochet off a kid's trombone
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
But y'all can get your feel of it today
Hit him with just enough shots
To make his body hard
Now I feel like we even
Soon as I get my karma right on Lindsay Rose
Shit they got snitches on the clock
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks
I brought the band with me
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
Ready with dope clips
My aura of war is raw to the core
The surface of the street
When I walk through the door
My purpose is to move up
Watch me overthrow the government
Gone in the streets of the D
Take the first shot then
The second rounds on me
And when the wars on the other side
Me and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contracts signed just for scraps
With a gun with a with a bat
Take a slug through the lung
I'm born crazy raised in more fame
It's for entertainment
Believe me you'll flow
The result is your family heart broke
Turn soldiers to stick figures
Real life born killers
We roll out like four wheelers
Tipsy off brown liquor
Stabbed it out the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride it like jockey
From the Benz to the Range to the black Jalopy
The only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Fall in and get quoted y'all
Welcome to the Shady game
He back with another classic
Smashed twice bastards
From street team to GM
This ain't a crime family
This rap family is a dream team
We took a break for a minute
From 06 through in...
We took a break for a minute
From 06 through in...
When the candle sparks
You bout to get it too
Played by the coldest man
Watch me drive a brick through
Right before my album drop
We took a break for a minute
From 06 through in...
We took a break for a minute
From 06 through in...
I catch ya up in the club
You all know it's pussy
You can get blocks from me
I hand rocks and jeans
And place at the end of the plots
Last week to the point a police was shot
We took a break for a minute
From 06 through in...
We took a break for a minute
From 06 through in...
Up from the west coast
In the race to be legends
Emotions that I hold within
Thinking I should roll with them
I don't wanna go to hell
I don't wanna go to jail
But I wanna kill a man
Maybe I should kill myself
Now I'm placed in that position
To provide the whole nation
Some say I'm a mental patient
Drugs is taking over me
Sorrow is controlling me
Follow my blind heart
Without somebody judging me
U will really let me go
But I live for a cause
That I don't really know
But I can't cause in time
For the truth in my life
Death is running over me
My conscious keeps on
Happen for when I get killed
Never take my voice away
Record sales how I live
Sucked into the pressure
Makes me turn to my aggression
Buried all in my head
Cry inside every time
I ever stop to read my head
I've never been near a man
U don't like it kill me then
I've never been near a man
No matter what the conversation
This is what it comes to
Imagine staring at your friend
Feeling they don't love you
U ride till the end but
They feel they above you
More to meet when I'm gone
I try to be a better man
Baby if you understand
My love for you is true
But I ain't really love myself
See nobody wanna help
Better off to end this way
Talking to my only friends
Came from a broken home
Smoke till the dope is gone
This ain't really just a song
Came from a broken home
Smoke till the dope is gone
This ain't really just a song
I'm the killer that moved out of the block
You can live in the hood and shit
You can live in the hood and shit
I left respect enough for an open casket
You can live in the hood and shit
You can live in the hood and shit
You can live in the hood and shit
You can live in the hood and shit
When I went to his crib he called police up
Can move a square mile by blocks till I'm creamed up
I'm a state case boy with a federal plan
That I've done lately
So I'm luring you cats into the second class act
The flow to die for and death blow survive
I echo through your external vibe
With internal experiences I've acquired
I got my grimy Shady with me you front you'll have to get me
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
Plus I survived everything you got in that chamber
You know what this is...
It's a movement... You can't stop it...
Now I have everything I need.
Use to say I couldn't make it.
Look I'm the one to succeed.
Everyone suddenly loves me.
I went and ignored that bullshit
I'm never going to fall down.
I know that I'm the star of this whole town.
Yeah I'll put up with this shit.
I'm on my way to the top.
Hear the lovely applause.
But that is only because...
Of course I love to rhyme.
And I'll watch you from the top as you try to climb.
There is a lot of hard work to
Put in to get all the way up here.
But once you've made it most of your stress seems to disappear.
So get your ass into gear and
Spit a sick verse for me on this track.
And if you kill it then of course me and my money will have your back.
Just remember to give it your best.
And lay all these other fuckers down to rest.
I gotta do it all today.
There's no turning back.
But stopping now never even crossed my mind.
I'm going straight to the top.
My forecast from now on is always going to be sunny.
But My forecast always has a slight chance of money.
I'm always going to be a threat.
Haters are going to come with arms wide open.
All you did was come on queue.
Act like your intentions are unknown.
But fuck you leave me alone.
And who's here for my money.
Another face with no a name.
One more bitch with no shame.
There's no turning back.
But stopping now never even crossed my mind.
Every time I open my mouth that's another stack.
My plan was to get you out of everyone's view.
It's not my fault that I'm fly like birds.
They just love the way I sentence all of my words.
There's no turning back.
But stopping now never even crossed my mind.
Open up your mind and realize that I know how to rhyme.
But that because I'm fueled by the one and only you.
You gave me the love that pushed me to create.
Now that I'm here all the results may vary.
Yeah you can run but you know that you're screwed.
I can't believe how you make me feel.
I'm writing this song because I want you to know.
The greatest things in life sure do come free.
And I love how you're eyes remind me of the ocean.
You've literally swept me off my feet.
But I'll plow through every single one because...
You're smart and you're beautiful too.
You're the only person I've ever adored.
When you're gone I miss you and I just want to call.
I really want what's best for you.
Don't even try to save me now.
Yeah when it starts raining it always comes pouring down.
I'm sick of all the lies.
Maybe you don't ever succeed because you're afraid to fail.
Maybe you don't takes the risks you know are right cause you fear jail.
You shouldn't let everyone step on you all lifelong.
Raindrops keep on running down my face.
I start to question if I belong in this place.
Enjoy your fucking life cause it could be gone in just a blink.
Some people ask what happiness is because they have none.
I don't even know what to do anymore.
Waking up every morning seems to be a chore.
I just can't handle life without having fun.
I'm the one who makes the choices.
We want to hear everyone of your voices.
I enjoy what I do and I'm not stopping for anyone.
It's like telling a baseball player to not hit a home run.
I'm going to write a few words and affect a few lives.
I'm standing in the rain.
I'm standing in the rain.
Don't even try to save me now.
So now I'm standing here with the raining coming down on me.
I'm thankful for the crowd.
Thankful that my music's loud.
Thankful that you've realize that you turn my whole world around.
I'm Thankful for the little things.
Thankful when I hear you sing.
Thankful for all the love and happiness that you bring.
I'm thankful for mother.
Thankful for my little brother.
Thankful that I can love you both like I love no other.
I'm thankful for my friends.
Thankful till my life ends.
Thankful for every second together that we spend.
I'm thankful for my brain
Thankful for the rain.
Thankful I can feel happiness after so much pain.
I'm thankful for you.
Thankful that you help me through
Thankful that what we have will always stay true.
It doesn't matter what I have to say.
Cause not a single soul is listening to me today.
And tomorrow isn't looking any better for me.
I just hope that one day things will be a different way.
It's time for change so that one day things will be okay.
Cause in a few years I don't want to be your grocery store clerk.
Minimum wage gave me maximum rage.
I'm so fucking pissed.
I thought to follow our dreams was the whole fucking gist.
It's time to stand up for the change that we need.
It's time to fight until we fall and we bleed.
Drinking and smoking is something that she could not ever stand.
So that's why I light up in the memory of us.
But now she's gone and I'm excited to see what the future brings.
Not ever going to let anyone control my life.
I do it as a thank you for letting me live my day.
Just staring at this paper hoping I can write a track.
Cause this is the only way I can express myself.
And I truly do hope that you're taking care of yourself.
Now I'm in control of my own damn life.
Just having fun till the day I find my wife.
Spit a few lines and make those riches.
Cause look at all the stack that I'm making.
Can't help that I'm so hot that I'm baking.
I don't take this rap shit too seriously.
I'm going to fuck this world so fucking hard.
So clap and your hands and let me see you dance.
If you want you can call me lance bass.
Except I get more ass then he does.
Then your mom joins in and I call it a family reunion.
And when I'm empty you better fill up my cup.
Thought I wanted to fit in with all those other rappers.
So clap and your hands and let me see you dance.
If you want you can call me lance bass.
Wrote a whole fucking song with no meaning and it was fun.
Crazier than the next fucking guy.
I got this rap shit all up under my belt.
And I'm just playing the cards that I was fucking dealt.
Cause it is what it is and I am who I am.
So clap and your hands and let me see you dance.
City life will leave you red with blood
After they rocked the party in the literal sense
Better follow me there
I'll make it back to Oliver Square
Currently unemployed but I depend on my friends
To contend with my impending impulse to spend
Till I get a little bit of riches from this rap
To check someone seated like their birthday in the worst way
Better follow me there
I'll make it back to Oliver Square
I tend to politic with Crisp
Better lay low if your connected to lame prose
I'm about to hit you with a Stella bottle at Halo
Your list will go downtown like the 135
Better follow me there
I'll make it back to Oliver Square
Ask anyone of my best friends
And so I said that they were biters
That shit plays first re... hearse all bars
Matter harsh scars and battle
Cause shark skin is fashion and that is me
Use to write for a site but I didn't spark smarter
But this isn't a house by writing bumper stickers
See the shit in the trunk is apparently lethal
Which y'all live to disrupt like American leaders
I'm gonna pull quick from the category
But you can't trust those with hearts like charcoal
I connect for the very best sound and set
A spare grim when I tear the heir apparent
Using the useful lights that would suit his pupils
Looking at suitable samples a chance be sold
I'm rational even when I'm slashing your nose
They think it I'll snatch your nose quick
On a pass with show flicks
I'm just pass with flow shit
You can role a script without blown test
Just showmanship on my programs
Which I had a dream in which I wished I had my hands raised
Yo I come through your hood with a sick demeanor
And on it is an anthem of a movement of the greatest of speech
Put screens when the the thunder claps
As the fluid movement knowing I kinda do it
A capillary and bust another one above that
And I'll cop one of your late records
I tote a smoking gun and hope that cancer sticks
I flew a delta kappa rapper in you mouth reticle
I might as well keep it all alphabetical
And I know you don't wanna twirl with bars
It ain't foreplay for banisters to doorway
A six shooter who does seven sins
8 step programmer... listen
Sleepers hand on the pillow
Sure I'll house you but I won't supply you a meal though
Not really... keep your points slow unto yourself
I'm the intelligent black speaker
With a sound that brings every relevant black speaker
Raps future is blacker than their important employees
I stick it to bitches split decisions
I can tell your friends lying
And I don't riddle with griffins
Style soft like a pillow
I'm Bob Dylan on the fence
Pyramid schemes with quaintness on the grip
I won't push this block unless enough is much money is spent
Cause the vandals took the handle
Hope that hits you harder than an anvil
The way I wrote my Epitaph date
With that face and the handbill
That'll leave hookers with a dime and your preference
Plus the wielded joust for the weaker and the poorer
Style soft like a pillow
I gotta vendettas with ice chains and grills
But I'll flame ya skills might pain your illness
I'm sedimentary fight or talk with on the dusty berry
To get my point across like an atheist archer
Style soft like a pillow
The truth is black and white like the 9 hole chips
Companies concentrate on the camps like IBM
Hello is yellow and red and bush is fellow in bed
Don't spend a dime until they get the price filed
Thirty seconds gets my message across
But I've even handed out cash for their jeans and hats
Seeming that I contradict quite slightly
Since everyone's interest is green paper
Like I told this punk to watch his feet
It seems what you wear is a cotton ideology
Or homespun philosophy from growing up autonomy
I won't say stop buying cause it isn't realistic
Don't spend a dime until they get the price filed
Freshest fit to veteran boss
Thirty seconds gets my message across
A pair a boys with pins to get locked to your latitude
Your an actor in a play and I'm changing the script
Magical bull gonna take you an go to true product...
Placement in your moving pictures
Hatred in your schooling system
Plus are targets this way is a display
This is the bravest record of vast instruction
Don't spend a dime until they get the price filed
Freshest fit to veteran boss
Bedfellows since dreams
She closes the blinds because it doesn't pay voyeurs
Like she was publishing books
These heels and shit with joint... but well... oh well...
Considering the position and the many other she knew
There any much that a brother could do
We aptly made it to her apartment
But my mind said time to bounce.
Before I had my chance to leave her abode
Bryan came through with the steel and the chrome
I think I'm ready to quit
Commercials sets the precedent
The truth is ruthless with the smoothest of pestilence
I tried to finger point what ashes to anoint
Till I found allow that couldn't strip joint at the hip
Selling point was demographics
But the companies are hungry for this distant design
Than smoking someone's bones from out the closet
They probably just have decapitated names
Pages of scripture about pain and evictions
Stumbling over opposing numbers
Crumbled pillars under which a mother wouldn't know comfort
With the blue smoke floating in my attic
The window might be open but the epilogue is tragic
I'm grinding my aspects I except this from your contest
But coke floats... when your dealing with a dreamer
That man took her for a ride and left her at the cleaners
And when I die I don't wanna choke on my last breath
And a suit to use and hands to dip a jay in holy water
For the blunt butts to come in this actual happening
She's lesser for knowing more
Drinks at elevation than what preserves dead bodies
The door next to her was church for misdirected people
The ministers were on a chase that was less than steeple
That bearded old man seemed his being was inside stained glass
I look away hear doctors asks infected patients
For cash to scratch like they were passing collecting plates
It doesn't make frankincense
Where they skip the bills
You're an empty grave
We can still be friends
Slab tray off the meat rack
If you know what I mean
My current girl is a stewardess
Still astounded to see me try
To play around with the boundaries
Beats hotter than a foundry
Less beef than a pantry
With the peculiar timing
Or friends by proximity
I have friends who spend in loud numbers
I have friends who depend on cloud cover
I have friends who don't know my name
When I tell her about the core of a man
Where they skip the bills
You're an empty grave
We can still be friends
My friends have dreams
Now guess why we're friends
Common bonds come along like common songs
With an offbeat delivery and awkward obscenity
We walk by the river stream
And wonder about the life and death of chivalry
I have a really good memory
And to the jerk that said words don't hurt
Talk to me for a change
Or rack up some kills
Or crack up some krills
So you can look good for your friends
Where they skip the bills
You're an empty grave
We can still be friends
I'm done shaking hands under pounds and waves
Because I don't have sex on the very first date
You're trying to fuck
But I know people like you who spend a whole night saying what they might do
With the kind of strange dream that hits your brain like a tumor
And I'm done shooting off my mouth at gunfighters
I run writers and walk printers
I officially block senders
So I apologize for this confirmation of the touring musician stereotype
I'm the same guy who's drunk and probably a bit bored
Where they skip the bills
You're an empty grave
We can still be friends
This goes out to all the accidents out there
I remember that summer up in the crib
Just like Adam with the missing rib
The cocaine kids where they use to live
And the hairdresser use to talk... yeah real real clear
But I gotta a grapevine he's going into fits
The answer my friend is blowing in the wind
How the dumb monkey fights gorillas in the midst
In the struggle of the fists for a slice of the fifth
I only talk chop like drop your drink
Silent summer's discreet about it
Gotta hammers in the wrist and a line of gout
And this is those kids with the rubber headbands
And deadpan comedy closed into the dressers
But I'm dull for importance if your down for a lark
Cover the phrase and keep it in your locket
With no shame on top or beneath the sheets
Met the young girl that I'd seen on defamer
The girls got loose on fructose juice
The time that I speak will track 9 of this album
Club goers prouder than a nose knows talcum
I still rock the arrows like the riddler
Wasted kids still sneaking into the club
That cadence weapon...
I can't believe he's fucking her
This plays out like romance novel
Involving hearts and hobbles
I slop up the goods like bounty
Like I heard she got on that head like a bounty
Now even though I heard he's gay
He's gotta show on the 8th
And though he's a charmer
This is held as a defensive mechanism
And I've seen him with Wilding and
You know what that means
And the median express with the city and breath
And I'll talk shit to anyone who'll listen
Put those paints and claims to good use
Make up messes and hope to find prove
I speak good facts to people at the scrap
The inviting is incredible and he's writing is illegible
But I think the word and paragraph
He heard his own songs
Is I didn't make up any of this shit
But you know I was at a house party
And he was so pretentious I mean refused to speak
But I never introduced myself but he's awful weak
Put those paints and claims to good use
Make up messes and hope to find prove
And claimed her miscarriage was scam
He called like a priest
I never hated anyone who's ever hurt me
Cause great bounties around the rumor mill shift
And he rumbles with a switch
And murmurs with it too
But there's only so much that one man can prove
And I will argue that you don't know Sherri like I do
Everything you've heard is probably not true
Every single word is pointed against you
Put those paints and claims to good use
Famous players painted unanswered rush
I'm not an ambulance chaser unless I have to be
On a tough one is garnering apathy
The sharp mercantile system with some bitches
Talk to me and you'll find out
Who's beating and who's sick
Who's speaking to Hugh's friends
And who's being a nuisance
To Ben and Jen or Jen and Brad
And that Tomb Raider chick
And don't hate me baby cause you paid for it
I just do what I have to get rich
Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise was my idea
Arranged relationships based on the patronage
And buy that rag like the maid in my house
There's no need to name the
Names that name names
We're aren't so different we play the same games
It's makes no difference if we win or lose
But there ain't blood on those fingers
About the freak that got away in the jeep
You're a fake Robert Blake with that punk
Whoever did that shit
You know it the chick he dumped
It run through my fingers like a dead blonde's blood
CNN will blame it on her husband's gun
Enjoy the fruit basket
It ain't the bible but it'll have to do
This happened in wilding's large art room
Where young men and women stay sparse at night
Juliann lives it big I think
There are millions of people that act when they're kids
I'm sure they end up exactly like this
I'm not bohemian like you
Not if I was the last one on earth
I bribed the bride with thick kickbacks
I know some assholes that she's been in crime pages
But they all have one thing up in common
They need the queen bitch
Repartee on every other day
I know about dames and the games they play
Just remember what we used to say
Repartee on every other day
I know about dames and the games they play
Just remember what we used to say
Your friends and enemies both dislike me
But I'm cold on the wire
I've never been in wire
I was watching the wire when we first met
Like disposable cells I was focused as hell
Mega man 4 is still my favorite one
I pushed my will on 221
Then I turned 20 and turned my wheel
And I didn't wanna weird her out no doubt
So I felt myself write something mildly committal
Where I styled around with esoteric terms
To articulate the profundity in our words
Contemporaries got it locked so strange
Atomic bomb code names
Repartee on every other day
I know about dames and the games they play
Just remember what we used to say
Repartee on every other day
I know about dames and the games they play
Just remember what we used to say
Deep down you find me foolish
My old guard fears your face
Based on the space of our embrace give chase
In the race for respect from a female elder
I hold heat like a welder
It's time young men in art schools accept being used
Your poor is cool not cruel
You're good undercover
I can't be your lover
I don't line a paper up between it
Juliann seems like a bohemian
Please don't start dissing me
Repartee on every other day
I know about dames and the games they play
Just remember what we used to say
Repartee on every other day
I know about dames and the games they play
Not now while you made a great choice
However you seen cause it feels real fresh
Over there it's okay to have gold in your mouth
Real estate sales are the oldest turf war
We've got proxy even though it hurts more
You're on a lease if your major label
I made a deal today with selling real estate
I get more billings than the parkland district
They sellout and their heads unfurl then
You won't see me where I'm by a pool with my girlfriend
Where everything is okay and all right and all that
I own the same house that I'm selling
I made a deal today with selling real estate
Rappers on the radio don't talk about shit
I know a couple kids who went to school for this
Remember that the chorus is a fast food jingle
That gets you in spots where the hearts start to mingle
That are not no better than the states
They use acronyms to make their opinions known
This why I might stay home for the next couple weeks
I lift up the phone like every fucking night
I know that my song is a screen name
Now girls love to be photographed
This is a fact that can't be contested by
The constraints of femininity in society
It's not that far from how everyone's a DJ
And how every single party is destined to be great
My bulletin board is on the baller block
Whisper in my ear about the beats on stage
And don't blow me off like a dandelion
See I really don't get what that means out of context
You make me wanna tussle with a bed frame like...
I met a girl at the states I wanted to pick up
That's when I say my cellphones biller's a mess
But I get pass stress through a keyboard press
She was too good to be new... goods
So I ran her through the scanner of my choice
I held her like a banner for my boys
On the cut like a swordfish
You won't won't make a double negative
Like my wife beats me up and my mistress takes me down
Good clean fun from the last arbiter of sound
And I talk in dirty verse and possessive pronouns
This goes out the criming cause in china
He hears my songs and later wants to see the verses
So I hang with the idiot like I was Ian Curtis
The boy likes your hair but why do you wear
It doesn't so much hurt that you can feel something
You paid for this and you wanted to be cool
You wanted a thing that'll last forever
This explains why the outline's first
The pain only begins when they start shading in
When they talked thin line but I guess they didn't see me
I don't think I'll let him work on me again
But I gotta thick skin and I've had a couple flesh wounds
You aren't the first and you won't be the last
I read all the facts and the stacks before this
Were on a strictly customer to employee basis at this point
If I continue to get work from you
Maybe I'll invite you into my personal life
Where you'll hear more confusions over pints of beer
I'll look into having unemotional sex
With an average looking stranger
Don't go and ask how I got my heart stolen
I keep my hammers on the ones she keeps his lock with a smirk
Talked with a jerk and he said I was awkward at shows
Words were a means to an end
The other day I tried to be the bigger man
I hear she's seeing someone now
I guess I just figured out she had cold feet
And I kick sore ones so lets put them together
And help each other walk
You shouldn't phone me for being too loose with my emotions
You're a cheaper shrink and you put something on me
I love the ones that hurt me like the Venus in Furs author
I reap the pros with the cons that I know
They keep a heavy heart under the lines that they tow
I'm thinking about another piece greed had a friend that once
I hear a lot of things about me
But stick to what I said to you in private
My roommate asked why you'd stopped coming by
So it actually does hurt in the end
But I'm done writing songs about her
I seen you at the club
You cut those jeans with a box cutter
That ain't a natural rip or tear
I don't get why you're trying to fix your hair
Dunks are dead when I fucking say so
Cause people there look at you without choices
Your clothes seem a lot like your voices
And that don't sit well
They rock the same tees even when they're over thirty
But they've been on black number about gun culture
It makes me not want to tell the cops
I wave my big fist at my friend androgyny
Girl don't try and cop me a call
Fifty rocks for some stock that they got in the mall
You probably shouldn't have bought that at all
I'd feel like an ad if my shirt said Diesel
While you pay a few pills for some hooks on your ass pockets
Give them a little run to get pigheaded like a mascot
Cause these little girls won't come for free
They hate anyone that looks different
Because it's a thin line from which many in the past flop
I'd rock a lampshade if I could get some fixed pay
They want to blow up like Rick James
Lived in 20 houses in the same damn town
Right around the block use to slang wraps round
I've known who I am for longer than I've remember
Y'all know what I'm talking bout
When it's time to rock about
Yeah I'm in the house
No that ain't lifestyle
I just rap about it so the kids can clap about it
Y'all know what I'm talking bout
When it's time to rock about
Yeah I'm in the house
Welcome to the club scene
I've never had fun in the club scene
Yo I dance real close in the club scene
Started a real toast in the club scene
I know some bathrooms they did a couple lines in em
At the studio I get a couple styles out
Made out on the floor with a couple dames
Y'all know what I'm talking bout
When it's time to rock about
You were barefoot and we were lost
I was supposed to play a party
My efforts have become exhausted
Glossed over for box soldiers
I was not there for the ride
Took my crate and made for the mainland
You were riding there by my side but
I didn't have the quarters for it anyway
As history presents forward daughters in a civil way
We were originally not in competition
That's when things got different so
You get your jukebox away from me
You get your jukebox away from me
The only jukebox I like is one that's plugged in
Don't like a jukebox with bitches plugged in
I was just trying to make some friends
She's in the booth to make ends
I play the old records every now and then
Never looks for slots so it can pay me
Every machine never tried to replace me
Your machines always try to take over
Don't you came to the party with the whole crew
You get your jukebox away from me
You get your jukebox away from me
You get your jukebox away from me
You get your jukebox away from me
You get your jukebox away from me
Now I'm concerned with a very different world
Dating Geminis is a split decision
But now I'm in the business of precision
Archers tied up with infinite indecision
You may remember those visions of fairly tendered positions
Of the hypothetical music industry division
Now I have a questionable question
They talk a good game and they've got something to say
The sexy machine gave me the millionaire flow
Backstage pass at the international air show
I let all of my worries and my despair go
Brand new tits and my hips are real narrow
I'm number one and the rest of y'all are zero
So I took your song and crossed my fingers for you
You look more like Whitey Houston
Not that there's anything wrong with that
When this song gets mapped
And that's a slam dunk if you were to ask me
Cold as can be on the Hot 100
I made this track for you
Awareness was along for the ride
Time was behind the wheel
His temper was a little warm
I used to hate everyone
Now I say fuck everyone
Strapping me to the stake
With their handshakes fueling the fire
They like to smile but they're all deceivers
They'll promise company then be the first to leave ya
I promise you'll be on the guest list
With front row seats on the bleachers
Ever since we dedicated our lives to speakers
We made a couple goals but still having trouble
With crossing the checklist off
When is the non existent calm album coming out they say
But before speaking for others ambitions
Accomplish something for yourself that day
They say it's all about getting drunk and smoking weed
But I'm sick of watching people's nose bleed
Now they wonder why I don't party anymore
Bring on the juice and cookies I'm a write this next song in
Go ahead and stab me at the next show
You'll be doing our record sales a favor
I respect women a cowards the only I refer to as a bitch
And I hate people who talk shit
And say they're just joking
They're so full of it I'm surprised their tonsils aren't choking
But time's have changed
Instead of ripping up contracts
I'm sick of battling everyone's cousin
Every emcee thinks they're the best
I used to think that too until I found out I wasn't
Everyone else wants to put you in a category
And tell you what's wrong with you
But all I can say is shut the fuck up
And let the song do what it do
I go by Time the one who fights with his tongue
And if we ever stop doing what we love
Go ahead and pull the trigger twice on your gun
Your depression and fear
This is Calm. a pill in your ear
Don't worry we'll probably dissolve in a year
People play every show like it's their first
I play it like it's my last
Every day's a circular step closer to the climax of your dreams
Fear is doing something you're not suppose to
Success is letting yourself float with the current
Staying with the people you're close to
Everyone I grew up with patronizes me like a superhero then treats me like a villain
And only liars believe the truth
All the Lois Lanes I tried to save died so now god locked all the phone booths
I tried to run from my problems but my head was with me the whole time
So I'm looking for a guillotine that doesn't have a 2 hour line
When I punch out I'm a parking ticket collector who brags about all the doe he's got
All the nothing I got
I'm not a super hero by any means
I'm an average Samaritan with doubts who likes to sing
I'm just another American caught in between
Inspiration and depression in front of a canvas
With no brush trying to paint his dream
But all I do is bitch about how I can't find my niche
Hate is a virus and it destroys habitats
Beauties on the inside but most humans are hollow
Tears on my blue face
So let's give all the homeless glasses and all the teachers contacts
So they can see their paychecks and every student in their overfilled classes
There's a smile under these lips and mind behind these bloody nostrils
Every day's a waking dream making the past a nightmare of fossils
No man is an island but I'm a peninsula surrounded by grief
Cry me a planet then cry for relief
I've seen people smile so much their cheeks ache
Sometimes I stare long enough to watch until it decays
People are crops and humans are locust so...
Nothing is hopeless except smiles blood and...
Goals are the blueprints towards your dreams
But I ran out of bricks now passion is my cement
Every architect is my role model
I was happy being the captain till I found out we were trapped inside this bottle
My life isn't as simple as taking steroids to improve my performance
If you are what you eat then I'm half cooped up chicken mixed with clone cow
It used to be rub sticks for fire and farm with stone plows
Now it's stoned yuppies who go to grocery stores
And buy anything they need from the clerk with tattooed eyebrow
If you can relate to this that's great
If you can't it's probably because I'm fake contrived ignorant and pretentious
Either way I got something to say and insides the parenthesis it reads relentless
No one looks like an airbrushed magazine model
And only soap opera characters don't need jobs and a house phone
The majority of the population is obese and ugly
We're not like those polite people we read about in poems
We're not like the polite newscasters who'd rather show numbers for deaths
Instead of all the blood involved in war and disasters
We used to have Indians and trees with trunks
Now we got businessmen and trees with stumps
They were smoking cigarettes when they 7 and shoplifting by 11
But mommy told them you don't want to go to hell be good and you'll go to college
Graduate get a family
Wait a month till you get divorced then repeat the process
In the meantime you go to church and try to find god
But you learn that you're a sin and how to hate gays will you demolish your progress
You decide to become an atheist and find that god is in the mirror
Crying naked and jobless
Keep hope alive cause the rest of us are dead
I got a god and a church and they're both in my head
My soul is on the bottom of my shoe covered in mud
Cartoons are violent are so are we
My life isn't a fairytale and Walt Disney isn't drawing me
Things aren't always what they seem
Cause even the pope has wet dreams
I'm from America this is where TV and hand gun deaths started at
Hello and welcome to the home of the Big Mac
Quarter pounded and teenage heart attack
Don't talk to me just give me pills and chemicals till you fix the problem
Let my pupils dilate till I can no longer see
Drop an anvil on my head and I die
Then watch a confused mob gather round and stand still on their cell phones
Looking for a helicopter in the sky
Tell me who you live with and I'll tell you what drugs you do
And when you got shot your head doesn't spin
And when you get hit with a mallet you don't get a lump
There's no such thing as happy ending
And no kiss in the world is gonna wake the dead or turn a toad into a prince
It's either love or fear
They say the world's divided between good and evil but it's not that simple
Cause both sides think they're right and kill anyone who wants to oppose
Just to give their citizens dimples
They told me to use my imagination so I imagined a nation
Free of brainwashing radio and television stations
Everything has a purpose the media's job is to deceive
Find happiness in your delusions and just believe
Find happiness in your denial and just smile
Keep hope alive cause the rest of us are dead
I got a god and a church and they're both in my head
Find a girl put her in the group and get famous
Fuck it all let's watch it breakdown
From the cops to the pot to the church girls wearing polka dots
To the station wagons with new age bumper stickers
Back to the Catholics with porn under their mattress
Right over to the rappers that need some more practice
They all think they're gonna blow up but they don't have any matches
This is for that girl at the coffee shop
From the redneck bars to venues with stickers on the toilets
To cities where I can actually see the stars cause the women aren't exploited
From the good songs to the bad songs to the next one I'll write
Back to the 9 to 5 with only 4 hours asleep a night
This is for disillusionment and hallucinations
This is for the women that inspire masturbation
If I could I'd buy you a sofa
He said hang up the overalls go home and shave
He looked down at the soil and saw it in 2 ways
The place where plants grow and future home of his grave
Either way he respected and despised both
He never knew what love was but been divorced 3 times
Blood is juice our organs are decisions are seed
The governments a gardener
He pimps for profit and makes money off of shovels and hoes
His drugs are pesticides that kill the good and the bad
We get along but attachments a bulldozer and my blades left too many birds homeless
I'm no magician I never had enough magic to cut a tree hugger in half
I chop down homes and I'll chop down my own
A tree has no funeral and neither do relationships
Every night I see your lips and we kiss
Then I wake up alone with your fragrance still tasting it
I threw her down and ran from the splintered tentacles
It took 39 that time but she came and gave me the 40th straight to my ventricles
The other doesn't seem to want to be it's lover
I'd find someone I can use and someday put into my grandson's hand
The ax hits the ground covered in love
So I guess it didn't mean a thing
My ax took an ax and gave me 40 whacks
When she saw what she had done she gave me 41
My soul rises and seen like respiration in 30 degrees
It's another beautiful day
Suns out but all I see is black and white
A closed mouth don't get fed but neither does one talking to much to swallow
I wanna know why vampires bite
I wanna know why dead poet's write
I wanna know what triggers the muscles when the frowns ignite
Let it rain flesh and blood till your clothes turn red and your shoes rot off
Having a blitzkrieg with gravity but losing
Let me welcome death for a while
It's another average ugly night and here I am
Trying to express how I feel but I'm just forcing shit
My body is my temple and the worries are torching it
My sanctuaries numb and synagogues in ruins
These milligrams are fun but there's no telling what the side effects is doing
Everybody's listening for nothing
They like to sit around and rewind the times when they were blue
Stuff me with hopeless till it hurts
Then serve me chocolate covered locusts with a side of discouragement for dessert
We buy books on how to love and live but fuck the how to
Focus on what you love and value
I feel heavy but there's no primate on my lumbar
So now the darkest passage always tempts me
My problems feel like weight on my shoulders
But every time I open the baggage it's empty
Sorry for the sloppy cursive
We all like to chuckle
We like to build sand castles
And complain when they get knocked down
I'm trying to make hate a stranger
While getting discouragement undressed
I stared success in the eye and noticed a difference
The one's who get a conversation stick with it
While the others just sit around talking about how they're gifted
Tonight they'll talk about determination and passion
Tomorrow they'll do nothing
Except procrastinate in fashion
And if I catch anymore popularity I'll be selling out
So I guess the only way
For anyone to know my name is to yell and shout
God forbid you should make money for doing what you love
God forbid I'm happy for a second back stroking through my blood
Come watch the cynics cut me from head to toe
Then join me for a swim in salt water
Bravery told me courage sold everything she owned
Arrogance and jealousy had a kid named ignorant
Ignorant met genius and hypocrite was their daughter
Who went to school and didn't like to be bothered
Chris had an imaginary friend named time
Who liked to stay up all night
Writing raps until he woke up in his slobber
Until he woke up in his anti
The dumbest thing I ever saw a person do was nothing
Let me drown in my shit
I'm gonna die with my ship
But watch what you say
I'm still waiting until the day I can save the one I love
And point the gun at the eye of the rabbit
I'm simply trying to heal from my art writing songs as I grow
But I feel every word I write is worth it
They say I can't do it
I finally got a date with persistence
But I'm gonna dumb her cause her smiles were anti
It was a one night lay I made her leave the same night
Tugging her cargo of agony
I'm as beautiful as a statistic
I'm as famous as dawn davenport stabbing me
And lord lay me to rest the day my soul suffers from neglect
I just want to write songs
That give people the chills and goosebumps on their necks
I just got off of work
The sun is shining bright
Got my paycheck in my left hand
And my crotch in the right
Got a half tank of gas
And a girl that likes to laugh
And she'd rather read a book
Then sit around and get trashed
And I say I wanna love you too
I hit up the record store
He tells me how satyr's
Been acting like a fool
I tell him I got to go
Meet my girl at the steak house
After that we're gonna go
Get her home before 10
I'm a go home and sleep
So I can do it all again
It's a quarter till nine
Trying to write a rhyme
Maybe it's the weather
Then I got to cross getting books
And records off my check list
There's so many beautiful people out today
So I'm walking like hunter S.
On my way to Circle K
I'm happy cause my frowns got drowned in my smiles
And my love called me up said she'd be over in a while
It's the middle of July but we're cooler than December
Sitting on a park bench soaking in the sunset
I pop another pill without one regret
We share a couple root beers and laugh between sips
I walk her to her home and give a kiss her to lips
I skip into my house about a quarter past 10
I'm a go to sleep so I can do it all again
The devil speaks Spanish I met her in Denver
She had a pixie cut and a Hepburn strut
Evil was screwing strangers
After cocktail parties
So here we are at the top of a parking garage
We were eating burger king then she asked for a massage
I pulled her shirt up
Admired the olive skin then I gently scratched
Her back then ran my finger over her bra strap
She stepped to the edge and did a swan dive from 6 stories high
She was just a falling angel didn't want to fly
Her wings aren't broken and the sky isn't falling
I keep my phone on silent
But still look for the light in hopes that's she's calling
I hope that she's calling
Where you going madam of the dark damned past
Where you going madam how long is this gonna last
2 years later and I'm buckled in a airplane
Unshaven heartbroken but the stare is the same
Wishing I could tear out my brain
Cause that's where the drug is
I ain't got no pulse I left my heard in north Denver
On the side of Federal on top of a note I never sent her
My questions marks turned to exclamations points
Cause around the corner came my parking garage goddess
Her hair was a little longer
But she still had those same big beautiful eyes
She gave me a smile and I felt my 2 year misery die
Then it all came back when she spread those 2 wings that I despised
I told her that I loved her
I put my hand on her cheek kissed her like Scarlet O'Hara
Then watched her wings turn to ash
Her horns turned into a halo of smoke
Standing next to her in my living room
I tried to shake off the confusion
I stumbled to my bathroom
Her reflection was me standing in the mirror
Where'd you go madam of the dark damned past
I find it kind of funny and I find it kind of sad
That the dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
What do you do when light switches don't work
And you're salsa dancing with confusion
When no one's your friend except needles and addictions
Without your enemies and your problems you'd feel alone
But I guess that's why we write fiction
While the others hack off their limbs
And complain how they have to hobble
If I'm in the land of the dead
Then it's when I open my eyes
Maybe that could release the agony
I awake everyday and I'm restless throughout the night
Now my house looks like Venice
And I'm every derelicts apprentice
We wait till we're 40 to look for love
Get our teeth knocked out and god's the dentist
I said I'd never forget you but you forgot yourself
For control they teach self hate
So we don't kiss the mirror
If you can't handle your crisis
Then why not just disappear
That's what hypocritical brave people do
The best dream I ever dreamed
Was that I was falling from a rocket
The best dream I ever dreamed
Was that I was all by myself but never alone
The worst dream I ever dreamed
Was that everyone was around me
But I had no place to call my home
I had so much to say but I had no lips
I had no tomorrow and I had no today
Everything was broken but there was nothing to fix
And plastic Christ is
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a do with my life
Waster says it's a joke
Some wasting on chasing a cross or a pope
We keep biting off more then we can prove
Till we finally can't breathe and can see
That our goals can't be achieved
Till we take a look in the mirror and can't believe
Till we look in the mirror and say that can't be me
So we chain ourselves down so tight that we can't get free
We like to keep ourselves in hell
I wake up with sweat on my brow from falling in a dream
When you sit back and laugh cause you know what
If we're all gonna die
I can still see your face when you'd ask me a question
And raise your eyebrow
Like when we were looking up at the stars
And you'd ask me what am I thinking about right now
You wanted to change the world
But you never wanted to change yourself
You just wanted to give me a hug every time you hurt me
Lust is a sexually transmitted disease and love is herpes
Keep lighting up your cigarettes
And I'll keep this fire lit in my eyes
Every night I look up at the stars
Close my eyes and cringe
Only to open them up and see you off in the distance
Wake me up when it's over
Give me a kiss on the cheek and hold my hand
Fly with me to the milky way
Where our thoughts can stay sober
And everything can unfold as planned
I find it kind of funny and I find it kind of sad
That the dreams in which I'm dying
And that's enough to make the heads swirl
And all of this coming from the man that bagged moth balls
Have another milk shake fatty
Because depressions on me
It's a good thing none the less
Chin straps and helmets are hugs for society
Residents live two times
And I'm wasting all of mine trying to make this kitty cat to purr
And that stands for the period
Which usually stands for the finish of exasperation
Of broken floor tiles
Johnny the drug boy was a fiend
All my friends are turning into assholes
If it's one thing I learned it's that
Pick my brain and try to pick out my eyes
But I'm that emerald city bound scarecrow
Who got his heart ripped out
Chasing goals accidentally stepping on their toes
They're mad they never found that wizard
Before that hell frozen over blizzard
Runs away to be TOUCHED all you're left with is RUST
But I refrain from keeping disappointment plural
We run red lights just to get to the next
We plant our addictions and water the weeds
A friend minus R ain't nothing but a fiend
I've been intimidated
I've seen relationships fade
I've seen friendships end in a day
After being built for a decade
It all feels the same when you're living the moment
It's harder to look in the mirror and face and your opponent
It used to be bros before hoes but now you're the gardener
So you took your H from happiness and turned it into hate
It's sad to think you'll get sick of the one you love
But the thought of them getting sick of you first is worst
Mistakes are made but sometimes it takes 9 months to make one
Have fun smoking with your lust at the bar
Oh there they go again
They're seconds running for the cliff
They'll fall for a minute
Then splatter to an hour
And decompose for a day
They'll turn to dust in a decade
And blow around for centuries
But all that's a light year away
I give a damn about the future
Santa Claus is fake my parents always gave me the present
Baby they'll come out of nowhere
Do anything they wanna do
Turn that frown down south
From the smile up north
From anywhere you wanna go
I don't really think so
I've seen a lot of clowns
But they never were in suits
Just by themselves red nose and briefcase
I got some things to say
I just wanna smile before I die
And if I never do that then kill me right now
Hey there baby I heard some different sounds
Keep on listening baby I promise they'll rhyme
That's why they call them songs
If they're not then it's all wrong
Then it must be something else maybe
We're all step ladders falling down the rings
Falling down the ladders to the bottom of the trapeze
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go
Baby you're sure to see
Anything you wanna do baby we can go
Anything you wanna do
There's no such thing as mistake
All the stories been told
There is no Santa Claus
We're all getting old
And your role models hit menopause
Fuck parties I'm not normal and neither are you
When it rains I think I'm going to drown and I feel like my teeth are rotting out
I never had friends till I got a car
Rome wasn't built in a day but it burned down in a hour
Smiling at fucked up days appreciating my difference
They feed us human meat and hormones
So I'm pointing guns at everyone in sight like American kids do
The people that actually listen only understand a portion
It's one thing to pick your path and another to follow it
And making friends is like babies fuck around and you'll get one
Lying to themselves that god can be within all human beings
If you want something ask for it
If you want there to be a happy ending where the world ends then it's up to you
Sunsets are epiphanies and dawn is amnesia
Every suicidal person is a hypocrite and everyone else does
We're all just a bunch of timed out blinks and breathes
Conspiracies are like sex
Fun to do at the time but we're all not the best
Just mowed grass and cracked open gnomes
We climb step mothers and step fathers
I met him out for dinner on a Friday night
He really had me working up an appetite
He had tattoos up and down his arm
There's nothing more dangerous than a boy with charm
He took me to the Spider Club at Hollywood and Vine
We drank champagne and we danced all night
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise
The gossip tonight will be tomorrow's headline
Well by now I'm getting all bothered and hot
When he kissed my mouth he really hit the spot
He had lips like sugar cane
Good things come to boys who wait
Sipping from a bottle of vodka double wine
He got those lips like sugar cane
Good things come for boys who wait
And for those that wanna get busy
Like a heavyweight champion
Once again you can scream and shout
This is what you've been missing
I know your suffering
Hugging and tugging and rubbing
Once I get my hands on you
I was cool but the room got warmer
They checked me in to the Holiday Inn
We knock boots till 6 o'clock
And early in the morning she sang this song
Once I get my hands on you
I hope you feel the same way too
Tunnel of love is what I'm entering
Giving it up like a good girl has to
You're gonna pay for this
With the way you cold love me down
Just because of the simple subject
Whether they admit it or if they deny it
Or else you might have to see a few skeletons
Pop off the top and rock wit my posse
To all the suckers out there
Who thought I was soft
And do something a little bit different
Be an undercover lover and a soul brother man
I wouldn't be surprised if she's my number one fan
And the perfect match has to be when you meet me
Under a palm tree in the middle of the beach
Bring a towel or a sheet like the boots with sand on my feet
After we eat what we brought on the pier
I hear your earrings jingle like a chandelier
As you premiere what you hear is not a simile
I'm on the top of your list for the best French kiss
I'm not the type to fall in love on sight
Since I write the rhymes to make the whole world sing
It doesn't mean a thing when you call me the king
It'll take more than a killer behind to change my mind
Give a chick an inch and she'll want an extension
Suggesting that I burn the hell out
Because I melt in your mouth like a snow cone
On and on as the saga continues
Here's another page on the menu
And you got a lot of nerve
After I tell you that I need you
Featured with any kind of line that I think what's best for you
Because I wanna get next to you
Sex with you is just one small part of the plan
Be an undercover lover and a soul brother man
I wouldn't be surprised if she's my number one fan
And the perfect match has to be when you meet me
Under a palm tree in the middle of the beach
Bring a towel or a sheet like the boots with sand on my feet
After we eat what we brought on the pier
I hear your earrings jingle like a chandelier
As you premiere what you hear is not a simile
Don't even talk about guns
So I don't give a fuck what none of y'all niggers say
You might as well had died and went to Hell instead of Heaven
In this profession I get busy without a question
Seeing me is like seeing a vampires reflection
Fast or slow flows connect like electrodes
Explode leaving areas abandoned
With more radiation behind than spots UFOs land in
Specializing in weapon diagnostics
My survival tactics be drastic like Rambo
I'm strangling niggers with my bow and arrow elastic
Whoever said you couldn't be five feet and thoroughbred
Never witnessed the cerebral cortex in my head
Beyond mission control the theory behind your thought
While you choke and suffocating off your own testosterone
I bring the force like a nutcracker
So if you buck against Free you better tattoo your name
Disintegrate hoes with they assholes in they nose
I put bitch niggers to rest in the bitch bassinet
I'm the meanest motherfucker on this whole Navy Seal team
And I can kill anything if it bleeds or breathes
Put me in the same category you would put Marilyn Manson in
Bugging like a satanic evangelist
Jogging butt naked down Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles
Every MC in your crew will get ruined or wounded
You talk the bullshit and be too scared to do shit
Spent so much time in the studio I had to move in
I can drink the poison from a King Cobra
I survive the nuclear holocaust like a roach arthropod
None of you suckers are even remotely close to me
I keep a library of lyrics on microfiche
You can't even absorb the rhymes I record
Or resolve the deep laws of the physics involved
I travel to the end of the universe and beyond
From the galaxy of Andromeda
And start spitting some lyrical shit that I can listen to
You haven't written the perfect rhyme yet
You don't even know the sequences to the Human Genome Project
You haven't come to terms with your God yet
And you refuse to believe in Unidentified Flying Objects
Beat the fuck up in broad daylight with a nightstick
Sitting and waiting for a cure from modern biology
I be looking directly into the human eye to see if you pussy
And completely ruin your ability to lie to me
Revving my engines like they were powered by Le Man's
I leave you in troubled spirits
I'm absolutely the purest breed of emcee
From the United States of America to Europe I deserve it
Touch my microphone on accident and get murdered on purpose
To make the hottest room temperature drop
Now if your song played on the radio for the first time
If you sign a recording deal for less than a quarter mill
And your advance is a hundred thousand dollar automobile
I know the vehicle was probably beautiful
You had five shots of coke and vodka
Then you convinced your designated driver to smoke a pound of marijuana
And ain't none of that shit in your government name
If you remove every living animal out of the sea
But you seem like you got true game
Get up in this ring man put on these gloves
Let me show how to handle yourself man
You don't got nobody out there with you
Hey man they been playing me all my life man
You know I won the title a couple of times did right
No but they can't hurt us man
Let me show you how to handle this yourself man
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills
Hey hey hey. You just hold it right there
We got an illegal low blow the fighter in the blue trunks
You'll be disqualified
Get the fuck off me man
When we go into battle we come out or don't come out at all
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
That shit was the worse rhyme I ever heard in my life
Somebody that he got to know is better than him
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
I'll even wait for the studio audience to applaud
Now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Trained to run twenty miles in soft sand
From a lost and forgotten land
You in and out and you agile with you flow man
They have no business to be in the same stage with you
The club scene is a regular hangout spot for unclean
While security practice is a mediocre precaution
But couldn't hit a stationary object
The party was coconuts until you spoiled it
I had to scream on the bouncers to carry him out
Bringing your handguns to every goddamn club I perform at
So they can use that as an excuse to shut down rap
He jeopardizes more lives than his own
With the gift of walking and running snatched from them
I heard you crying in your sleep but it'll be all right
If you tell me all your secrets
Yet in the middle of the night
I heard you crying in your sleep I held you tight
If you tell me all your secrets
And he had her believing he was the man she wanted
Women never get it often enough
And the reason people love they mother so much
I heard a soft moan in the middle of March
Then I felt a powerful force push me forward like a dart
Then I set a course for the border
Mother Nature's karma calling me to the rock of Gibraltar
If I don't make it through I'm a goner
I was destined to be a son instead of a daughter
In the middle of the night
I heard you crying in your sleep I held you tight
I'll be there for you...
If you tell me all your secrets
And I heard that's where Hip Hop is gonna start
Five months from being able to lay against your chest
Yeah yeah yeah we ready
That's gonna bring us back
A terminal condition that effects all biters and liars
It's characterized by a certain type of lifestyle
People that treated you foul just wanna be nice now
Smile and raise they eyebrows when you come around
I remember when I first started to work
And tried to get this job as a label intern
They'd crowd around me till I'm surrounded
They told me my album was coconuts so they rewound it
I pull a silver can out of my trousers
Studies show it affects one in every five people
Hypodermic needles or the ingestion of medicine in teaspoons
They'll send you an eight page pamphlet to read through
It'll cost you a braincell just to cypher with me
I'm the type of MC that rocks for the glory
For anybody trying to go the distance
I'm barbaric with the alphanumeric
Hitting you with lyrics that separate your body from your spirit
Into little powder like crystals so I can sniff you
What I say should be displayed at the Smithsonian
With the shotgun like a front seat passenger
You must be asking for some sort of a massacre
I'll attack your cardiovascular
Shatter you like glass in automobile crashes
When I smash that ass into blackberry molasses
Rip your speaker to ashes and kick a hole in it
I roll up on ya crew quicker than long sleeves
I hop into the backseat of a cab and rhyme
Till the meter says 9-9-9-9
Whether they signed or unsigned
More lines than the Bible quoted from Jesus
More lines than an African herd of zebras
Approximately fifty years ago
under the direction of President Harry Truman
and in the interest of national security
A group of twelve top military scientific personnel were established
This group's primary objective
was to desensitize us to the truth
And to suppress the material evidence that our planet is being visited
by a group of extraterrestrial biological entities called the grays
And reality becomes illusion
If I showed the masses where we was at or where we was going
I'd shatter the social balance of the world as we know it
When our souls were sold to the heavens
for technologically advanced weapons
Crystal enhanced brain implants and mind control methods
And the focal point of our problems on this planet are not domestic
Responsible for laundering trillions of dollars from the nation
for the construction of underground military installations
Abductions and cattle mutilations
Experiments on human patients
can take place in several subterranean bases
A hundred and fifty stories below a basement
Cause through the manipulation of certain biological agents
that didn't believe in the Drake equation
Well you need to know that this is a game
and we're being betrayed and played in the worst way
Tune in to channel zero
You see if God was truly a single entity that's not what he would say
Short staccato clicks and beeps
A highly advanced form of speech
Even though to us it seems like they only chattering their teeth
They used to swim deep in the oceans beneath
Then they evolved into mammals with feet
And walked right from the shorelines onto the beach
that could slow time and the speed of light down
to any point in the universe
Space expedition teams in the lunar regions
to walk across the moon without leaving a clue
Before life on the surface even appeared
I hope you become aware what I'm spitting in your ear
of questions to the Grand Deception
If you just listen to my lyrics every day for a couple of weeks
My techniques will eventually kill you just like red meat
Most critics get mad because there's nothing to critique
Whenever I'm rapping or rhyming with irrefutably remarkable timing
No pain no gain in this rap game
For the fortune and fame in order to remain
Then crush a Thug's Bones with a chrome slug
Just don't give me no ice grill eye contact either
Yo physically I move at a velocity that'll break your stopwatch if you clocking
My brain consists of twin Pentium chips
Double the clock speeds of a 586
And nothing about my physical matrix is BASIC
You'll be so surprised you won't believe your own eyes
It's like a Jamaican seeing the snow for the first time
Everybody in the East just ride
Everybody in the West just ride
East to the west to the north
Getting so high that whenever I drop shit
Then you don't need six senses to feel me punch you in the face
As drunk as Lady Diana's driver wit reporters behind her
Alcohol in the hands of a minor
Yo prepare for the worst This next verse is the face of death
Me without lyrics is like a porn flick without sex
I go off like a cannon and blow up the planet
The marijuana makes my eyes bright red like brake lights
There ain't a microphone brave enough to give me feedback
They should come with a large drink and a biscuit
I plan to push the Earth in front of Halley's Comet
So recognize or be hospitalized
Got me ready to set it with kinetic energy
See I need much more energy then my enemies
If I wanna make more Bill's then Bellamy
So I could be on MTV with women constantly
Telling me I resemble Billy Dee
I make fly rhymes to get my name on the scene
Then when I'm on the scene I do shows to get the green
For that thing on page 43 in Jet Magazine
Cause whenever the head is severed from the human body with a sharp enough weapon
The brain remains conscious for ten seconds
Long enough for me to give you one last message
And when you get to Hell you can tell Lucifer I said it
The human Rubik's Cube like you got something to prove
Get everything in the club thrown at you and your crew
Too busy mixing your business with your bitches
While I be in the lab composing forbidden scriptures
Jump up and down if you love the sound
We Rip and Rock until we tear shit down
I'm hardcore to my inner soul
Directly into the unknowns of a black hole
Even though I know the shit is fucking up my liver
We got it got it got it
A Navy Seal underwater in a submarine vessel
Sucking on my arch enemy's penis
You need to recognize I'm trying to introduce something new
Something I would sacrifice my life or die for
Something if I was already dead I would rise for
Something that would make a fool a hundred times wiser
Something that will help all mankind to prosper
As the universe expands
I contemplate whether it was God or the Big Bang that made man
Sometimes I wonder how come
We can't live without guns
What would have been the outcome if the South won
What in the hell caused the assassination of Malcolm
The federal communications commission listens to politicians in the position
To decimating the population of women
It's called socialism
From the United States to the United Kingdom
The location is planet Earth
We got less than a minute left before the planet Jupiter
Is ignited into a star
I know it sounds bizarre but it's mathematics
A specific sign for some of the planet's inhabitants
Our country is corrupt from the president to the cabinet
Took a minute to exhibit that I'm sick with it
At a thousand degrees Celsius I make emcees melt
Like a javelin to stab you in the abdomen
The intellectual athlete accurately rapping so rapidly
Yet he makes perfect sense mathematically
Rhymes ricochet off the inner walls of my lungs
And go past the tongue faster than bullets come out of guns
Whenever the head is severed from the human body with a sharp enough weapon
The brain remains conscious for ten seconds
I'll hop into the back seat of a cab and rhyme
I'm hardcore from the nappy follicles in my pores
From my jaws to my torso where my organs are stored
And from my balls in my drawers to the floor
I pray to God they hurry up and start the Third World War
I don't give a fuck if you rich or you poor
Don't give a fuck if you got your picture in The Source or Forbes
I don't give a fuck who won an award
Let they blood pour all on the floor
I'll leave your corpse stiff as a board
Getting in my way is like jumping in front of a car
I'll send you to hell where you belong
Who could flow for four minutes or more
Got millions of styles and I've mastered them all
A metaphor matador fast enough to make the bull charge and crash in the wall
Get everything in the club thrown at you and your crew
I'll snatch your crown with your head still attached to it
I'll battle you with a gun to my neck
I'd rather be a lion for a day than a lamb who lives forever
Then bust a shot in the motherfucking courtroom and watch it clear out
Lyrics got my undivided loyalty
And there ain't nothing on this God damn planet that's worth more to me
I'd beat his ass and took my tape back
Then I bust you with a shotgun blast
It's not fun so I don't laugh
Trapped in a max security building
Knock you out like ten shots of Vodka and Gin
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Without a strong rhyme to step to
If I'm handcuffed with the right to remain silent for it
You should double up and put a dime on it
About ten times on it
While people call the request line for it
Cipher sounds keep pushing rewind on it
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Without a strong rhyme to step to
I just snatched the Jesus piece off some Christians
They went from silver to gold to platinum
Before dog fighting and aerial strikes
Before emcees picked up pens and started to write
Before promotional marketing and poster snipes
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Without a strong rhyme to step to
There'll be a lot cats leaking out their life liquid
Until they laying dead on the granite
Now you laying deceased
Is show you how you can get spotted by one too
I fuck around and pull eight out
Put it in your mouth and keep squeezing till the whole clip is sprayed out
Shoot you in the stomach till I see the last meal you ate drain out
Bullets buzzing by your head like insects
Just the thought of having a woman laid next to you probably threatens you
You probably look at grapes and see testicles
You probable fantasize about vegetables like cucumbers and bananas having sex with you
And you probably let gerbils crawl up your rectum too
I stop your heartbeat with heat
Old school burners with
Barrels big enough for you head to fit in the circle shit
Just to handle a kick I gotta glue it to my hands and shit
We got permits to murder shit
You got kidnapped and you don't even know the reason
Watch who you beef with
We all know how to hold the heat properly
You got kidnapped and you don't even know the reason
Watch who you beef with
We run up in radio stations on some unannounced shit
The black box that was supposed to record the pilot's voice got destroyed
It'll probably be something you regret
You'll get wet with horizontal rain droplets
You shouldn't have started this shit in the first place
You got kidnapped and you don't even know the reason
Watch who you beef with
Put a red dot on your head like you Hindu
Then put a hole in you big enough to put my open fist through
One and a half million in cash when it's delivered
And holds your crucifix tighter when shells is firing
You need to watch who you beef with
You got kidnapped and you don't even know the reason
Watch who you beef with
You need to watch who you beef with
You need to watch who you beef with
You need to watch who you beef with
Let my spit lubricate the chap on my lips
Meditating on this rap shit
Because my freestyle reign sovereign
With a deeper conscious than the Prophet Muhammad was born with
My brain cavity's enormous
While the right one harnesses darkness
The type of dark that makes a house haunted
The type of dark you feel when you dead in the coffin
Fake emcees haul ass like they running track
All I have is a pen and punishing kids
Abdomen punctured and look what I done to his wig
Every word I say detach your vertebrae from your spine
Push your forehead to the back of your mind
Try to explain what it's like seeing your brain
We started the battle with a grapple
His partner in back of you tried to attack you
Cartilage get torn until the whole bone split
He tried to flip but I left his body dangling by his hip
I swing him around like I'm dancing with him
And stick my dick in your ear and fuck what you heard
Poisonous poems travel through Walkman headphones
Spit turn into icicles in mid air and slit your throat
After I dip them in hydrochloric waters
And connect them like letters when they in cursive
I'm faster than leopards running across the vast deserts
Clip you while you running by and trip you up from behind
And I can't seem to get away from it
I played trumpets to warn you that I was coming
There's one billion ways to die and I've already tried
When I aim and fire my rhymes
While the art of emceeing is steady dying
And drown you in less than an ounce of your own saliva
Paddling across the Niagara
My afterburners should be burning you after your body's already been splashed with acid
And you turn into ashes
Assassins camouflaged in the grass blasting
Leaving blood all over your lady like Jackie Onassis
I fly your body out of Dallas
Perform plastic surgery while we're airborne and switch caskets
Then lie to the masses
My left arm's taken but my right one's free
With rhymes that appear clearer than liquid crystal
My lyrical is more visual than television screen pixels
You probably had no idea what you was getting into
Yeah he be acting rude
That last album was terrible
When he's on the radio he never got a clean mouth
But the shit don't come out till next week
Yo that shit be coming bugged out
He waited too long to come out...
Drop on top of the blue line... right beside the red one
Bring it to your ass if you the challenging type
I heard he's from Philly yo
I seen him in Bis video
He's so skinny though
I don't even understand his shit
Yo I heard Jay manage him
Yo he got some heavy gold shit
Probably let them hold it
I'd be the richest man on the globe
Coming to punish you pigs
We can rhyme fair and square or fair in the sphere
They stand and stare as I appear upon a cushion of air
Hotter than white people taking vacations
Shrivel up like raisins and they become cancer patients
I manipulate the metaphysical power to hold my breath for half an hour
Continuously breathing outwards
Electromagnetic cassettes melt tape decks
Amateur swordsmen get stabbed through they face mesh trying to escape death
A world where the whole globe will contract Ebola
I never said that battling me would be impossible
I just think it's highly mother fucking improbable
Strong enough to stop a bull
I could kick a rhyme longer than your whole album
Like fax machines when they start receiving
Beat them till my own hands start bleeding
Beat them till they lungs stop breathing and they heart stop beating
With three fifteen minute breaks in between them
That's what you get for fucking with this lyrical demon
I got cast out of Heaven for treason
Got cast out of the Garden of Eden for letting the reptilian beast in
They spit a hundred bars for they freedom
See I'm much too nice to compete with
And start to punch trees till they leafless
Till the whole planet suffocates and then release it
Fast enough to give your brain an aneurysm
The way I rip apart the competition when I be spitting
Show me a man that can't feel him
I'll show you a man that'll grab him by the neck and put his head to the fan on the ceiling
Suffer real banned from television shit
Drop him off the roof of a building and let the news film him
I hop in front of the cameras and tell them how I'm feeling
Tell them how I'm tired of the state Rap is in
Ninety percent of the shit that rappers kick is subject matter less
Using the same formulas to have a hit
Got a infrared lens to detect your body's Fahrenheit
Until you plaid them into cornrows
Track you till your shoe soles develop holes and you get corns on your toes
Till your teeth develop halitosis
But you been going so long without deodorant you don't even notice
A hundred eighty six thousand miles per sec can melt flesh
I'm out on tour with thirty city trips
Every state is like bitches be bulimic for dicks
Smoke the most enormous trees in the rain forest
While the people go insane for us
I pierce a cloud and make it rain on us
Break the equipment and tell the engineer that I ain't paying for it
I freestyle the whole set
Don't give a fuck who you offend you got to fight till the end
If you fuck a groupie chicken when you out on tour
Smoke a little bit of weed with her then fuck her some more
Tell her to bring three friends so you can fuck all four
Almighty God blessed you with a dick and two balls
So if you like to fuck pussy that don't mean that you wrong
Your superstar status don't mean shit to me
Lyrically sucker emcees still get frequency
Look at the sixty hour shifts I spend with this
So look inside yourself and tell me what you see
Cause your empire to Fall like the season before winter
Don't get beside yourself like clone twins in the placenta
I liquidize your rhyme
Consequently blowing by me crystallizing your mind
The government assigned sentinels for Horsemen elimination
Claiming we were mutants of artificial insemination
Lost my limbs to bomb shrapnel
But through cell regeneration the blood accelerates at twice the speed
Peep the vindication indeed
Rob three banks at the same time through Multiplicity shine
Seeds to abnormally born and scorn wit a man's face
Brought to you by your millennium group The Horsemen
I'll throw some fucked up kicks on
Beat you in your face wit a rope knotted up
See I'm tired of this Barkley shit
Let the heaters spark again
Police calling all cars off then
Powerful as a motherfucking Vulcan
For vengeance in the name of the Horsemen
And we abide by the code of the streets
So just abide by what you ride by
Just abide by what you ride by
Swear by our fore fathers
Then I drag your frightened ass through the darkness
I see all of y'all as moving targets
And my lyrics be the atomic rocket
Wit military arms and bombs strapped to our chest
Casting meteor storms and comets
Now who wanna make the next rise comet
And be the first one left unconscious
After I squeeze your head like the Charmin
Fuck around and see a lightning bolt around your throat
And squeeze till your head smoke from all the electric volts
Satanically sacrifice your ass like in a colt
We was lyrically sent to y'all
Like demigod to put a end to y'all
Spit bites like dogs and get the scent of y'all
Wit the power to put a graveyard inside a coffin
Let's serve it out like the breeze
Catch me hopping off the A train in a New York state of mind
And the wife of a careless man is almost a widow
Put a crown of thorns on whoever the king of rap is
Your whole crew gets bayed and neutered
As soon as I aim and shoot at you get sprayed with bullets
That got fucked in the ass by a father figure
Autograph you with a bullet wound for a tattoo
I don't give a fuck if I don't get my license back
Then gallop northwards
Then gallop northwards
Just abide by what your ride by
Wit my motherfucking arms crossed
Took over the whole race course
I'm about to black out with 100 bars on some professional shit.
Because I recognize it's all about timing
In front of twenty foot bonfires
With mercury ion rockets
That's why I got extraterrestrials that want to battle me
They even tried kidnapping me
And that's really what caused Roswell
Undercover operatives working for COM twelve
Hit you with nuclear cruiser missiles
Hear the wild wolf growl
Interrupt the cipher unannounced and you'll get punched in the mouth
With the Southpaw Southern fist
I'm an experiment gone bad
When I throw the Florence flask in my hand
Flammable liquids in the lab explode and you get stabbed with all the flying glass
Trained to blow up commercial aircraft
Dividing myself into a hundred ten times
You can't deny the offering's an offer
Flows that glow with aurora's that spark of light
I took an oath to rip everything I get on
In the wrist bones from gripping microphones this long
I'm just a small fish in a big pond
That gets pissed off whenever I get picked on
And night vision goggles
You need about a million more soldiers to even the odds
Plus eight hundred thousand to even consider a war
And two hundred thousand more to even look hard
You better drop your flag and withdraw
And drag y'all across the motherfucking asphalt
You mother fuckers really get on my nerves
I close my eyes when I freestyle so I could read what prints across them
Then raise my arms like a sorcerer and cast a fireball into the audience
I flame broil suckers
I dare a mother fucker to cross it
I'll even call my man Black Rob at two in the morning
Break your camcorders so you motherfuckers can't record it
Fuck the soft shit and fuck what y'all think
Got your picture taken and put in a tabloid
That's some sick shit homeboy
You got below average intelligence and poor penmanship
Take fifty cents and purchase a pack of peppermints
Now ain't nobody fucking with the mastermind
Nikola Tesla and John Von Neumann
All wrapped up in the body of one human
I'll smack you wit a backhand
That crack your back like chiropractors after looking at your CAT scan
And stalk my own rap fans
I'm like a madman fighting a war
Blow you away wit a force that'll leave your body lost
I rock till I can't rock no more
Till I can't get no motherfucking props no more
Till they boo me on stage when I'm out on tour
Claws rip through walls of cast iron
Flatter than a Yankee baseball cap rim
I'll blow you in half
I'll blow you in half
I destroy your whole city block when I'm ready to rock
Magnetically energy popping gates of radio waves
Oscillate lyrics and beats copulate to pop your tape
Manipulating space in large proportions
Millions of brain organs get lost when I start talking
About shit like supernatural forces
Most of you motherfuckers barely
The best place to hide a lie is between two truths
The aftermath of a nuclear blast
Where the average death sentence becomes a dead paragraph
I dig a five by nine rectangle in the grass
Read your epitaph and bury your ass
As the coffin gets lowered into the ground slowly
I'll blow you in half
I'll blow you in half
I'll blow you in half
I'll blow you in half
That's the day I was going to cut your throat
I seen my watch was twelve hours late and I missed the show
But none the less I'm glad that I finally reached you
Ever since the accident I've been dying to speak to you
To tell you things have changed and I'm a different man
Saying shit like we should be together
I meant we should start a group
I just wanted you to recognize that I've got talent too
I mean story telling kind of like how your album is
They showed me techniques to help me deal with pressure
Whenever I remember that crazy night when I was being reckless
I crashed into a Lexus right before I finished that last sentence
The next thing I knew I was underwater and breathless
I was unconscious for a second literally dying to go to Heaven
Until some fellas came and pulled me from the wreckage
They started CPR then they called the paramedics
In retrospect I probably should have used a gun to end it
By the time the car had sunk my pregnant girlfriend was still in the trunk
And I was still feeling kind of drunk
The ambulance came and they put me on the stretcher
Hooked me up to the IV and checked my blood pressure
One of them was so concerned that they wouldn't leave
He hoped in the back of the ambulance and rolled up some weed
My vision was blurry I couldn't really see
I just remember his voice talking to me
And fifty stitches for my wounds
After a couple of months of therapy
He let me write some rhymes and go on tour with him
And I'm writing the best rhymes of my life
He introduces me to people as his lyrical equal
Let me write a rhyme on his album and even produce a beat too
He's not the type to call you just because he needs something
Clef stepped to him and told him he should step to you
You was looking at him the same way I'm looking at you
Tell me where you think all of these record sales spawned from
Are merely the same thing
I feel like I'm Rembrandt and my man Van Gogh is a Mason
I went through changes not being with the majors and all
Till my man Louis Lombard gave me a call
And talked about some other way to cake off
I could put you in about three thousand stores
And get at least fifty thousand orders
I'm satisfied with the lineup I've rhymed with
Including future superstars I've worked with thus far
And mechanical mandible jaws split you in half
Before we battle there's two questions I have to ask
I can see you trying to get me like they got Biggie
And I've got security with me
I'll give you a buck fifty so quickly you won't even notice your nose dripping
So much blood on the floor you might as well be pretending to be mud wrestling
I'm bugging I know a lot of y'all loved it
I played y'all like a bunch of puppets
You played Russian Roulette with a musket and got busted in your own nugget
While the rain pours and the storm thunders
Your rotting carcass smells so pungent it turns my stomach
Attracts the buzzards and Fox Eyewitness News coverage
Fronting as a janitor in a school or something
He's a complete risk to the American public
Let's get one thing straight
I seen you at Ruby Tuesdays with a toupee
Or turn yellow like I ain't brushed in a few days
And the blood starts to taste like red toothpaste
Like a little witch's brew in your vanilla latte
Or perhaps fillet of dog in a Malaysian café
If I was a cook I would probably take a half day
I've proved myself time and time again
You could never expire the fire within
For the use it was intended
True Hollywood Stories... True Hollywood Story...
True Hollywood Story... True Hollywood Story...
True Hollywood Story... True Hollywood Story...
True Hollywood Story... this is a True Hollywood Story...
I vaguely remember 1974 when I was born
As soon as the doctor cut my umbilical cord he put me in my mother's arms
I was crying when she looked down at me
She absolutely had no idea
She just kept tickling me and ignoring me
True Hollywood Stories
We moved to the states a few years later
People couldn't understand what I mean
My man used to boost travel pocket for me
Without them I wouldn't even have a voice
I showed the world I was nice with the verbals
That's how I got signed to Universal
I released two albums
Thank God that the drama didn't destroy me
True Hollywood Stories
Five months later we met Stan
He was cool so we let him join the band
And introduced him to the rest of the Horsemen
Then I hooked up with this cat named Lou
Now the whole crew's on tour with me
True Hollywood Stories
This is a story about beef
This is an independent release
And that's why it's totally dependent on the streets
I ain't got no record label behind me
Maybe nobody got the balls to sign me
Looking for who sells shell toes that I can match with my silk robe
Here's my tax ID number it's worth tenfold
I remember my first album it shipped Gold
I'm dying to see what this one sold
Like I haven't been there before
But at least I'm on a different vibe now this year it's on
It's definitely a different vibe west of the Prime Meridian
The women are prettier and the chronic is superior
We're on the top of Mount Olympus sharing our interests
Wore a pink mink and a double link mink
Around here I know a lot of cool places to eat
So be careful how you approach things
You must be getting insecure or something
I been through a lot of things in my life but I learned from it
The only difference between me and you is a budget
When I was fucked up you didn't give a couple G's to help
You want all the hot beats and the streets to yourself
Besides a little drama with my first two records
If I win the lottery you can't tell me how to spend it
You got something to say don't put your henchmen in it
Don't tell me that your school of Hard Knocks turned preppy
None of you mother fuckers know me and you never met me
And if my name wasn't shit then you wouldn't sweat me
High when I wrote this but sober when I spoke it
I went out and bought your album two times I ain't hating
Next thing I know you're talking Jamaican like you're a native
I had nothing before and I have nothing now
You treat me like I'm not a member of the rap game club
The majors already drained my pockets and now they want to drain my blood
This record is proof that I made it
Talk to Louis Lombard he'll put you on the payroll
When you see me on the street now I probably really glow
I can laugh at a meaningless joke
I'm doing it all by myself
This is what motivated microphone fiends do
We heard it through the Grapevine and now we know it's true
Me losing is the only way to get you to giggle
I can see you at 33 and still be living with your mother
I ain't never got a problem to meet on a backstreet
Don't forget the bottom line is that I hate you too
We heard it through the Grapevine and now we know it's true
Somebody you know was on the rock patrol
I seen him pull up in a Pinto
I couldn't believe he looked through your window
You keep a set of keys under the mat
On the street he could get a hundred for that
I hope you really don't think he bringing it back
I'm telling you girl he stole it
He was standing around the last time I saw it
I remember when you bought it
I remember when I seen him this morning
I had to look real close for a moment
I was shocked when I seen it was your shit
He put it away because he heard somebody was coming and just took off running
I told you woman he love that rock
I remember when I met him two years ago
He impressed me though because he was gentle though
He didn't have no doe but he was sexy though
But it got so good I had to let it go
It was wonderful he put it on me slow
He even asked me to marry him in Mexico
I can't explain how he made me feel
I was head over heals in love for real
I took him home so he could meet my dad
For a year and a half I treated him good
Then he'd show up crazed in the need of a shave
If I had lost my way he would have done the same
I'm telling you he ain't gonna stop
Baby he just love that rock
He'll run up in your crib like knock
He'll take everything that you've got
Then go straight to the pawnshop
He's riding that white horse
And he don't want to get off
He didn't know I had a mind to just bloody his nose
And let the blood pour down on his white clothes
He started going on about pushing a big Benz
He doing it big and got unlimited ends
You gotta represent when you be writing them lines
Don't be a fucking millionaire in every one of your rhymes
Then he fucked it all up and said some shit that I said
Like Tony Soprano taking meetings
With a psychologist about his emotional feelings
And his criminal dealings
He even talked about how to make alcohol out of orange peelings
With ill cannibalistic animal instincts
You don't have enough wisdom
Put my big dick in their mouth and smear their lipstick
Come here you stank bitch
If you hate me why would you recreate me
They talk about me so distastefully lately
I know you can't commit but at least try a sample
Come after you and capture you
To keep track of you in case I decide to marry you
We can be friends till death do us part
I believe in abstinence just not tonight
Steaming like I'm dreaming on the couch with my feet up
You ain't never leaving me girl so stop fronting
With biceps and a chest implant
Not a skeleton with hardly any skin
I know it's irrelevant but his penis is probably very thin
I'm hung like the trunk of an elephant
Or the trunk of the tree the serpent wrapped around in Genesis
With the same devilish malevolence
She'll get envious if I ever rub your ass gently
Tonight I'm being a pimp baby not an emcee
After we eat we can check a couple of spots tonight
After we fry you we puff a blunt and then it's gravy
There's only just a handful of rap critics
That ever had a close encounter with this rap wizard
In other words your lyrics are too primitive
You need to be more descriptive
Look at the way I flipped it
A True Hollywood Story
I manipulated this miserable music business
Then I caked off too by going independent
I make about ten cents every sentence
It's my third album and I'm working on my tenth Benz
You sound like garbage
One of these days you're going to end up jobless
Pushing a shopping cart with the same Crystal bottles
You was drinking out of when shit was popping
They talked about your drug addiction and what was behind it
The bottom line is how much you sold
No one gives a fuck if you flow
You Gotta Get That Doe
But I can't live without it
Should I talk about material objects
Always got yourself up in the middle of the drama
Need to get smarter and try to holler at the rookies
Now is a new day and we be focused on the paper
Piling with hate and you need to holler at the maker
Everything we do is connected with getting paper
If you now where you're coming from you now where you're going
I'll fly anywhere on this planet to promote it
Maybe I should come out with my own line of clothing
I jump on stage and I prove I'm a showman
I slam it when I'm done and make sure that it's broken
Where I come from opportunity is golden
Had to ease off from a show I just peed on
She took me to Supreme Court and the judge got screamed on
Pass me the paper and pen and put beats on
Rip rap songs put down pads with
Fools who do get abused like broads
In a battle for juice where rhymes are metaphors
When my horse appears count your prayers
Leave the floor wet with all the bloodstains
I ripped down stages on many occasions
Bootleggers be in the front row trying to get a clear copy
So just acknowledge the way that I'm gifted
I Ripped the Jacker so hard he might kill himself
My baby's mama and my offspring so bring it on then
So I can show you how I devour
They belong in a landfill
And start bragging about their massive ice
Germaine spit insane shit so stop hating if you can't applaud me
And give rap music the glory
I never thought that it could come down to this
It's a subject that I just can't resist
Here's a list of things I think you should do
As yellow as some pineapple punch
They got that way because you don't brush
You probably got gingivitis in your gums
Did anybody ever tell ya they look like straight cheese
There's a reason why you keep calling my name out of the blue
If it's because you love me then I love you too
We heard it through the grapevine and now we know it's true
Just tell me that you love me I'll say I love you too
I won't do things to bug you and start trouble
I don't care if the plane's leaving and I get left behind it
I'm not that simple minded
If I had the time to spare I'd probably type it
Or get Stan to write it
Sure I'll talk to you in private
You might get backstage tickets or ice cream for your politeness
Extend your arms around me then bend your arms
That's why I'm happy that you could finally say that I love you
And so I can tell you overwhelmed by the way that you breathing
Calling people at home while they watching me on the TV
Then I flip and give the children something they can get with
No it ain't all for nothing something got to be something
What was you doing at ten shows I tore down overseas
And it's funny how you was at the album signing in Queens
And once I recognize I be the type to give it back
One of which went on to be a successful actor
The phone probably rang two times then I answered
He told me that DEF JAM wanted to ban me
They add so much credibility to elaborate schemes
Internet chat rooms with live feeds
Of a rapper being eaten alive by live bees
Sound barriers like the Lockheed
That's a rhyme from like 9-3
If I'm high when I speak the knowledge is deep
They served me court papers in the studio I did this in
Missing from society because they lied to me
They didn't want to accept my doctrine of society
I studied with hundreds of scientists and science teams
Somewhere in Afghanistan USA survival teams
Keep an eye on their surroundings in the jihad regime
On my album out next spring
I promised myself I wouldn't shoot it without that scene
Germaine Williams that's my name
And occasionally Rip the Jacker but never Stan
Get it through your head and don't ask me again
It so happens I'm looking for a copy I could buy
A lot of y'all shine but y'all can't rhyme
And it's about time that I put y'all in line
Twist your mind with twisted rhymes
As weird as Michael Jackson's nose from the side
If you hear the engine knocking just pull over to the side
I guess it hasn't been serviced in all this time
Old school rappers I wouldn't be around without
Ain't got shit to say but keep putting albums out
Don't let what I said get you upset
Some fifty Tomahawk cruise missiles
Not only from ah US ships
I want to get drafted
I want to see somebody get they ass kicked with standard military tactics
Totally flowing with my emotions in my moment of madness
I'll wake up the whole barracks
You better go back to your bed before I have to act up
You might be the next one to get ripped you Jacker
You better not tell the captain
And just feel so sorrowful
It's just a rhyme really none of this is tangible
And before I get angry I just won't answer you
Let me find out you still calling out my name
I'll crash into your tour bus with a plane
Make the enemy my little bitch in a skirt
So who better butt me and put to sleep the enemy
Outlasting all the privates in my company
Fighting for my family and the cats that grew up with me
My Band of Brothers rarely just smother the enemy
Razor blades cut ya face and leave a scar so you remember me
Lurking to leave y'all with bloody red turbans
When I'm overseas I can't eat the food is nasty
If I get hit one of the team will carry me
So go ahead Draft Me. go ahead Draft Me
Raw metaphors keep you high for months
Ain't too many categories I can fit in when it come to spitting
We're gonna be fist fighting
I got the shotgun pumped
I posses the lyrical ammo to battle
And rip any one of you warm blooded mammals to shambles
I make examples of you and eat a mouth full of your crew
I'll battle you over the phone you can call me collect
I'll battle you standing over the toilet wit my dick out
I'll battle you juggling a hand grenade with the pin out
In a stolen car wit the fin number ripped out
What's hidden behind the curtain
My urethra to your uvula quenches your thirst
Put your flames out with dry desert dirt where leopards lurk
Lock your soul down with an esoteric weapons search
Strap a bomb to one of your label's record clerks
And activate it as soon as they get to work
Bypass security networks with select words
Call the press first and ask them who has the best verse
Give me the respect I deserve
See I broke into their mind by
Battle rap is nothing but a serendipitous whore
But the limelight isn't where I belong
The top four don't even look in the mirror no more
Eradicate Africans that sold Africans to Saxons
And forced black men to pay taxes
Split your bullet proof chassis in half with a rapid Gatling
Slay dragons with old passages from black magic manuscripts
I found in the cabinet written in Arabic
Translate the characters one by one like Arafat's tarot card suggests
I make terrorist's threats through your stereo set
Let me dry you off with some of this fire I spit
Potent as Hennessey that was distilled in Tennessee
One shot scrambles your memory indefinitely
Nowadays a hundred bars ain't impressive to me
As I grow old I get colder like the declining climate
Scientists from Sirius B designed my specs
Astrally project during heightened sex
That's why they revert to threats
They curse and throw fits
They're like immature Earth cadets looking like Captain Kirk in a dress
Then I'll defecate what I just digested on you
Just to get the checkered flag I'll put the pressure on you
Put the extra effort on you
Detectives check your mail and your Messenger too
You can take this verbal slashing that I left as a clue
Execute the type of wickedness the Devil approves
Which basically means I can do whatever with you
I'm a rap music mutant with a cool name
Misconstrued fame but I spit butane
Quick as a glance and flickers from kerosene lamps
So the longer they resist me the stronger I feel
Spread your ganglia from Tanzania to Flats of East Anglia
The man eater in a wife beater spreading typhoid fever
This is the Master Thesis underneath the deepness
Run a plot on the map in hyperspace ya
From the Society for Scientific Exploration
What I say vibrates no less than nine ways
And the black and white images fade into gray sound waves
Trap my adversaries like a mouse in a maze
With a bewildering array of lyrical display
My circularized third eye sees all
Atlantis was surrounded by four sea walls
I read one fourth of the Library of Alexandria
I wish I could have learned more
About the shapes of the Sacred Geometry they used to draw
Ancient in many ways but not nearly as old
With processed beryllium by the quintillion
They cooked on symmetrical stoves
With my logo etched above the hole where they inserted the coal
And they barbecued birds to the bone
I talked to Mr Fuller over the phone
And he said he had a contract to rebuild Rome
He said he didn't want to do it alone
I told him I was busy writing poems but I'd think about going
The process was slow and the doe was low
But I took it as the perfect opportunity to grow
Plus I had never traveled that far from home
That plays tunes from a laser black sax
Words concocted from the lyrical locksmith
From every angle the competition gets boxed in
As Dr. C indoctrinates his doctrine
Translated the English alphabet to the omega text
Life is now but death is next
Post bond out on bail from the belly of Hell
Communicate through diatonic and pentatonic scale
These dark side tales might effect sales
I set sail and hunt down erect sperm whales
Used an aphrodisiac to get a female
Your vocab is smaller than a cockatoo's
In the studio with James Lipton reminiscing
About the script that was written before the beginning
All of a sudden the boos turn to applause
Can't even count the bars I've expended so far
I wish the clock would hurry up and tick
In a rhyme the size of a Tylenol pill
I'll show you what poetry is really about
The side effects will make you pass out
Before the community of real emcees die out
These are the contents of the Covenant of the Ark
You've got to be as obsequious as the disciples of Jesus
On CD code in the form of a poem
To questions you're probably not advanced enough to ask
Ten percentile smile and five don't even laugh
When the chalk's in my hand and I'm drawing up graphs
I present the contingency plans to the top brass
They probably think I'm on speed I'm talking so fast
The body of the rhyme is smooth like Body and Bath
My symmetrical shock waves shatter glass
From green grass to African baobabs
CDC in the streets passing out gas masks
Gorgeous women thank me for the oxygen tank
Maybe I'll become another casualty in the field
They'll engrave my tombstone with Damascus steel
The best beats in the world couldn't rival my skill
It's like pouring a cup of water on a million beached whales
Grand eloquence of an unprecedented scale
Close your eyes and feel the rhyme because I'm better in Braille
When the Curriculum storms Behind Enemy Rhymes
Computer programmed bars come out of digital jaws
This is the toughest course in Hip Hop so far
Behind Enemy Rhymes when the Curriculum storms
Computer programmed bars come out of digital jaws
This is the toughest course in Hip Hop so far
Behind Enemy Rhymes when the Curriculum storms
Inhibitors that inhibit them from seeing the vision when
They spit against Bis and them they must want to get dissed again
Through louvers in my chest bigger than wind tunnel vents
Flies through your ride and gulf stream fuselage
Blistering speeds fool eyes with fast rhymes
A hundred times with vocal signatures too complex to sign
Rhetoric versus reality the reason I rhyme
I spit at you injure you if you step out of line
A transcendental intellectual
A marvel to the medical professionals that claim they have more tests to do
Before they understand what I'm equipped to do
Visual psychoanalytical living proof that I'll rip you
I'll rip the roof off like cyclones do
When the Curriculum storms I'll rip a microphone too
A molecular miracle in the physical
My lyrical has always been something different for you to listen to
Enough to remain in the membrane of you're mental pool
I'll train your brain muscles and take you to school
When you're in a Mic Club mood you never get booed
Aptitude and attitude are your battling tools
Computer programmed bars come out of digital jaws
This is the toughest course in Hip Hop so far
Behind Enemy Rhymes when the Curriculum storms
Computer programmed bars come out of digital jaws
This is the toughest course in Hip Hop so far
Red stuff comes out of squibs like a Hollywood script
Cardiologists hook up the heart monitors quick
The audible probability probably ain't probable
Helicopters stabilize at low altitudes
I'm talking to the negotiator laying out the rules
Under orders not to shoot but they break your vertebra with boots
And if I'm rapping sloppy G's got me
Blow out ya brain in your casket
Where slugs crush your melanin dome
Chrome that's known to break bones in an elephant
Chips in the field of fortune
Dead men walking with hits on the grills
Witness G Rap put it back in perspective
Leave ya brains on the dash in your Lexus
Bitches in draws with dick in their jaws
I ain't bitter but if I give you the finger it'll be behind a trigger
Up at radio telling them what you're going to do to me
My orders are to smoke you if you get too close
The whole globe is scared of my flow
Nowadays it's like I'm scared to be known
The methods of my motivation is completely subjective
My perception is completely parallel to perspective
Rhyming is the reason I spit in faces
Habituation of my flamboyance without rational reservation
And shots blow all them cowards and foes
The blood trail lead to a corpse
Treat my appetite for greed with a torch
Roll up my hand sheets with the force
You die forty foul dooms for forty coward moves
It's all about the experience and what you take from it
With guns and hundreds of clips on Uncle Sam's budget
A hundred rifles for self
Feed her rum and raisin ice cream shower her with diamond rings and money
Twenty three hours a day I study
My adrenaline rushes when the enemy rush me
Trying to bust me because I swore I'd defend my country
If I could choose between being lucky and having money
Nothing negative could ever touch me
What must be is ultimately not up to me
But I'll sacrifice my life for yours if you trust me
Pin my medals upon my chest
God speed and God bless
In the end I hope God is impressed if I'm put to rest
Say my name out of the blue because I rhyme the best
You can come and download every rhyme that I spit
You can pay homage to Rip for one dollar a clip
None of those rhymes is on the album bitch
It's a storage facility where I keep my shit
For the students in the class that want to peep my shit
Break a bootlegger leg if he leak my shit
Technology not available for purchase
At a standoff distance at a thousand feet
I illuminate the target and pound him to sleep
To within one micro inch if you're out in the street
I could close my ears and still move my mouth to the beat
Dial up to your network and make your files delete
Doctor Norton's too sick to help your PC's
Virtually I'll make your virtual memory freeze
Wipe you out before I even get to the B's
From the lowest earth orbit up to the heavens
I had to go underground to get over the pressure
Bury you beneath the bedrock on a bed of rocks
The Copenhagen curriculum of metaphors
Everything from Bob Marley to Tenor Saw
To System of a Down song number fourteen
Sometimes I wonder whose listening
The auditory Pavlovian conditioning is so sickening
Is really what makes me rhyme supreme
Eventually all of my albums will be out of print
There will be a clone for every style I invent
For every line I rhyme intense
If we're in public I'll double it
Put this on your study list and go study bitch
My best piece of work is still yearning to be birthed
And nobody should treat it as though this is something special
Can sit down and begin to write something and discover
Second to none in this profession
You fuck around with Bis and you're finished
With a sentence administered from the Executive Senate
Chord progression followed by metaphorical methods
Predators eat intestines of anything they're interested in
Slice you like lettuce and celery stalks severed
Then make an emcee salad out of suckers and sell it
Drink Red Bull beverage to increase lyrical leverage
I only give respect to Mic Club members and my own mentors
In the center of my circle where I dare you to enter
This is art imitating life imitating art
Imitating the brain simulating thoughts when I talk
Idealistically I'd spit for free
Fly around us with propulsion that's soundless
Spitting rhymes out by the thousands
Nitroglycerin tablets under the tongue calm me down a bit
Rhythmic high intensity conflict is a given
With scissors with rubber ergonomic grips for the fingers
And five polite thugs that work for Mic Club
And move forward as expeditiously as I can
Ain't nobody in the world like Bis
The nicest with radio telescopic devices saying tight shit
Lyricist turned microphone terrorist
Airlift me off the front lines to my therapist
So I can sit in his chair and tell him how much I care for this
To engage in the exchange of ideas and drugs
With months of food rations beneath the Catacombs of Paris
Theories of super lattice is super savage
The farther I climb the harder I rhyme
You've got to face death and survive to feel more alive
The quality of life is an illusion of the mind
At the moment of truth I'll know it's definitely my time
As my soul is squeezed through the sieve
And see the resemblance of my face in hers or his
Who knows what the future will bring
Now I've got to follow orders
Defend borders from Maine to California and Seattle to Florida
If I could talk to the Oracle I know what I'd ask her
I'd speak to her about my passions
As the hour glasses turn and my life passes
I'll just wait until I see the Master and I'll just ask Him
Executive Order 11002
The reason you know me but I don't know you
You really want to know what drama is let me show you
Keep it in mind this is just one point of view
Drama is living in a Third World country
Fucked up and hungry without no money
Drama is trying to adjust to the circumstance
Missing more than one leg and more than one hand
Drama is being chased off your land
By a funny looking man in a suit that works for the bank
Drama is what's happening to the ecosystem
The rain forests that get destroyed annually
Drama is the nuclear threat that we live with
Drama is HIV statistics
The infected person that you might have sex with
But drama is living with the afterthought that maybe you could've prevented it
Drama is eminent it comes in other forms
Never mind the offenders
Drama is the prison population
Some belong there but also some belong on probation
Drama is not being able to change one thing
Drama is corporate scandal
Drama is being a millionaire
Drama is having one too many women
Even though you always need a spare one to swim in
Drama is dealing with your jealous impulses
Learning how to hold it all in with no emotion
Drama is blind devotion
Drama is having your deepest secrets exposed in the open
Drama is having your heart broken
And the person who broke it doesn't even motherfucking notice
Drama is trying to carry the burden all by yourself
On your shoulders and it don't exist
Drama is what gives people clues
Drama is a tool you can use
To distract the enemy so they can never improve
Drama is fear of devils and fear of God
Drama is a rookie cop calling for backup
Drama is the spin zone of a politician
Drama is the struggle of change
Drama is inevitable there is no other way
Drama is what drains life force out of you
Drama is negative but drama can empower you
Drama exists in everything everyday
Drama is the innate nature of man
Pull up a chair to the aristocracy of commonwealth prophecy
The legacy of generation three isosceles
Integrated with memories that mix melodically
Get chopped in three for pathetic hypocrisy
False bureaucracy breeds poetic monopolies
An addict for drama and dramatic oddities
Addicted to bottles of sticky green botany
Tripping off three hits of E
A rappers speech is slurred for eternal depravity
Naturally ignore gravity project astrally
Ascend gradually till the stratosphere passes me
Earth's actually esoterically absent to me
Evil beings that wrestle with demons in the deep
Useless to eat 200 pounds of rotten meat
Shrink heads drink black milk collect black teeth
My women are ornamented with a blood soaked wreath
Like Christmas minus Christ plus the heat
Voodoo curse on your last and future release
Unleash the worst plague put the world under siege
Till your name is unheard and your face is unseen
Till your just a nightmare of an accursed dream
Tell the supreme to curse your whole team and your unborn seed
In the blood filled streets you're a leech
Less than a man a poverty stricken thief with grief
At night you speak to Satan before you go to sleep
Thou shall inherit disease and defeat...
To determine the age of anything ever made
Regardless of how the outside surface has changed
It's like trying to ride a bull
Let's have a dictionary duel after school
Check me into a nice Cedars Sinai room
If you ain't got this album you're missing the proof
Glow against the pale background of the moon
Toxic fumes spoil complete stocks of fruits and foods
Burning flammable boxes of booze
Got in the groove even though I'm not in the mood
Motherfucker you didn't win because I can't lose
Tie you up and drag you in the saliva quagmire
Euphrates with the eye of the tiger in my iris
Drop him off by Niagara Falls
Write my name on a banana and put the banana between his jaws
Nobody disrespects lyrical law
I'm the best there ever is and the best there ever was
Train like a grunt face down in the mud
I'm probably somewhere on the microphone fucking it up
Vocal with a mirror to make sure my lips align
Bright as the LCD display on a new MP
Prototype of a true emcee
If you don't like the quality then talk to me
That's exactly what it sounds like when I'm punching your teeth
Stand next to me I might put a lump in your meat
To tell you the truth I thought your rebuttal was weak
The body of my literature is bigger than South America
I keep on hearing that the police have caught me
But they won't fix me just yet
I have laughed when they looked so clever and talked about being on the right track
And you still want me to protect you it doesn't make sense
You ain't show me love when you were at your apex
I had to keep the situation in check
The industry fucked you I'm just paying them back
Besides talking shit I ain't done nothing to them
I wrote all your best lyrical lines
If it wasn't for me you'd be writing pitiful lines
Nobody knew you bit off my rhymes
You're a lying ass bitch and you know it
The industry's all about game
I shit on them all the same and I leave spit stains on their brain
Like liquid chocolate spilling over their new white trainers
Insane is an understatement I'm Satan
I just know the both of y'all are trying my patience
I don't give a fuck about a beat I've been rhyming for ages
All right then listen to mine
I'll jump in a costume impromptu just to rob you
Put the nozzle to your eyeball and tell you what not to do
Rip your tonsils out through your nostrils
Shit on you in reverse and suck you in a brown hole
Suck the power out of your soul
You're nothing but a coward in a cold freezer with an hour to go
Like drug lords checking to see if it's talcum or coke
I could kill you by drowning the globe
Or I could just spit inside of a hole and put an ounce in your throat
It's a dick between your mother's thighs divided by Pi
I'm the sickest linguistically illicit lyrical misfit in the business
I've made the decision that my standards are above precision
If it ain't dope then don't spit it
Don't be sensitive and get on the defensive just practice your penmanship
If you can't spit at hot temperatures then just quit
Be careful of the tongue it tends to bend to the left
According to manufacturer's specs you'll make a mess
And rupture the blood vessels in your neck fucking with Rip
Got millions of blueprints on zip disks
Stock versions of sick verses that come with conversion kits
With a course every Thursday that teaches you how to burst like Rip
You never experienced work like this
Bitch welcome to the serpentine world where I spit
A lot of these rappers are jealous that's why they attack you
They think you're the best that's why they want to battle you
At the moment of truth I let you design the tattoos
Just a couple rappers don't want it to happen for you
Ragging on you like battling is all you can do
You didn't sell enough units to be honest with you
You got dissed by a legend but you damaged him too
Look what it's running into
I don't feel like having this discussion with you
I'm tired of fucking with you
I wouldn't disrespect you as another intellectual
Ever since my third album I've been mentioning you
I just want you to listen to what I'm telling you
People know you won the battle they won't give you the credit
A lot of people don't want to admit it
But I consider it a real privilege to bear witness to your lyrics
I just need you to chill for a second so I can send a positive message
The author of the work ethic Genesis
You can't rhyme forever there's always somebody with better shit
I keep you out of the public eye for a reason
I keep your whereabouts secret
All you want to do is steal rhymes from me
You constantly keep me behind walls of concrete
You lock me in the basement like a fucking zombie
If I was a priority you would acknowledge me
Give me the keys to the garage I need to borrow the Jeep
That in order to save it
I am going to tell them the truth
About their ministry of justice
But if we didn't though
It would surely be cause for war
Don't want to but the forces forced me
With the incantatory allegory they translated for me
That's the reason I bend vowels when I spew from the mouth
Spit drooling out a very grotesque view at best
Burn through desks at the University of Budapest
Sitting in a room with a windowless view
The circumference of a third eye so vibrant
In the protoplasmic fires in a black geyser
The explosion can be described as a white iris
When the absolute began I don't know where I was
Mayflower two thousand two phase one
Adapt to the pressure gravity has laid on my lungs
Light waves bend to the weight of Bus
In a cushioned room with leather doors
Handwriting experts take a look at the letters I draw
Six minutes Vinnie Paz you're on
Lyrically this is the liberty of Liberal Arts
I started raw so the haters could see what could happen
I was Allah while the pagans were speaking in Latin
I'm the origin of science and math
I'm the origin of everything you trying to grasp
Been dying to ask if Jedi Mind is the real
Well I'll let you inside my mind and you decide how it feel
I'm dying to kill and bring to you apocalypse
I start a lot beef with lots of guns and lots of clips
Hang you from a hook then drink the blood your body drips
Claims are being made
That for me go far beyond the available evidence
And often even contradicts the evidence
Forensic psychologist Samuel Dubious explains
Realms of Heaven and Hell
Glowing angelic gel spliced with bovine leukemia cells
They tell me the meek will never inherit the world
I dream quasi Draconian dreams when I sleep
Peyote leaves mixed with the blood of a priest
In a room where the ceiling leaks of crimson grease
Rock bottom transforms human beings to beasts
It's the optical stimuli of watching men cry
I hope I've got time to repent before I die
Bury me at the beach if the sea is out of reach
Looking down at you bitches looking at me
Sucking from the breast of knowledge constantly weaning
Try to visualize what Harry Houdini was feeling
Handcuffed under water without breathing
Near death on a fatal quest for air
His career was based on facing his fears
To take destiny from the hand of the man upstairs
He didn't mind the cold stares he got from his peers
They couldn't tell him where he was going or how to get there
It's better to be prepared and fail
Than to be scared and unsure of yourself and still get killed
Don't rhyme like I used to but I still got skills
More than a couple confirmed kills under the belt
Hunting emcees is like hunting elk
I don't do this for anybody except myself
Stuff a motherfucker like a trophy on my shelf
Round the clock as long as I've got a cup of cocoa
And she gives me blow more than two times in a row
I'd rather chill with her than kill you with a rhyme that I wrote
When I'm on the Mic I release fire from throat
If you disagree please do it quietly folks
Don't you know that's like Gary Coleman fighting the Hulk
Fifty miles out from the coast
I'll beat you black and blue then I'll get a tat of you too
Better yet I'll put a tattoo of me on you
The most theatrical emcee battle of all time
Killer cobras that hover over Jehovah
Technically these words shouldn't even rhyme off paper
In practical practice my style's even greater
Compared to me you're energetically inefficient
You need ten times the enzymes to process one of my rhymes
You've got to rewind every one of my lines
Figuratively the language is too dope
Academic journals print my lyrical quotes
They show parallelism in all the albums I wrote
On any track I come off strong automatically
Whether I write in an active or passive capacity
Poetry that I spit is synonymous to a glyph
Written on tablets of clay mortar mix
It's like observing the birds fly above the earth
Borderline insanity trying to break through humanity's border
With a new curriculum every quarter
I'm the porter to the portal of the Secret Mic Club Order
Baptize you with Jamaican white rum and water
If you've got a hundred bars then I know you're a warrior
I'll be the one who awards you and pins the medal on you
Explain the lyrical grand unified field so I can test your skill
You're clumsy and dumb like a hand with five thumbs
Especially when you listen to rhymes
Words become time and time is disguised
Around the world in eighty seconds through a sentence
Experience is the mother of all adventure
Learn from the past or the future will punish you
Power flows to those who remember
This is Mic Club's primary premise
I think I write because it is the only thing I know how to
I never gave y'all a hundred bars
Never made some groupie bitch drop her drawers
And I never wore that white wife beater
Never spit wit Keith Murray or Little Jamal
I never rocked on stage at the Apollo at all
I have to just tell them it wasn't me
I never been overseas
I never had a battle with about a dozen emcees
I never been off the scene to long
But I never made an impact
I didn't sell enough units
I probably look stupid
It's like the rap community doesn't know what to do with me
What if I persuaded some bitches to reproduce with me
I got a secret let's keep it between you and me
You can say this at my eulogy
I heard you got beats
And turned it up loud to see if had some real beats
And I ain't even got to work with him yet
He showed up after me and forgot to bring his own DAT tapes
He shook my hand with both of his hands
And told me he could play it over again with both of his friends
I don't give a fuck who really produced the shit
You know we ain't got a budget
About to rip y'all with the raw shit y'all
Never been the type to talk
A hundred times more sharper than stainless steal razors
The stench of a thousand ounces
Don't give a fuck what month you dropping in
With pictures of you with a dick in your mouth and a dick in your ass
I blur your vision like slow shutter speeds on the camera
Get up in that ass like colon cancer
Brain cells handpicked
Organically enhanced with third millennium medical standards
By genetic engineers with scholarship grants that studied at Stanford
Make you nauseous till you vomit
As I drink the blood of a thousand emcees
You should be afraid of my fangs in your neck draining you
Get your head flown if you dumb in the dome
Or struck with some stones till you feel numb in the bones
You better keep your big mouth closed
In the direction of my wrist bone to release your soul
But you chose the other route and got blown full of holes
Write your name on your tombstone scribbled in blood
Give me a little love
Seen him in the Pun video holding up his lighter
Flip and dip like shrimps and scampi
Switch language like a black kid raised by a Spanish nanny
And we do it like that when we in the dungeon
But let's keep that between me and you
But let's keep that between me and you
But let's keep that between me and you
But let's keep that between me and you
I still got a lot of fight in me too
Spit a rhyme in your ear just to frighten your boo
Modules with blood vessel designed tube and
My mind is moving to rewrite blueprints with new ink
But let's keep that between me and you
But let's keep that between me and you
But let's keep that between me and you
But let's keep that between me and you
But let's keep that between me and you
But let's keep that between me and you
But let's keep that between me and you
I done been from Jersey to Brooklyn
Done been through Queens where the crooks hang
Really love it when a girl got a cute name
Got a cute attitude and a cute frame
Done seen a lot more than some loose change
Do Egyptian love with two hands
Sometime spend a whole day outdoors
Music got us in that mood
Every night I go down to the city man
Them stripper chicks know how to strip man
Them hoes be thick but sick man
Every stripper think a mother fucking rich man
Think I got a bank account with a million man
Case of Crystal cost about six grand
Bitch better get a less expensive brand
How about tickets to my next five shows
You know my elbow just brushed your thigh
I be up in this club all the time
But it's the first time that I crossed the line
You know how these stripper chicks love to tease
I think I left my cell phone back at my seat
I had a couple of drinks and I need a receipt
Follow me to the bathroom to pee
I keep about three G's in my briefs
Change your style cause its time
I'm just a ghost of rip
I relocate so quick they can't close the net
On the loose again nobody knows what's next
Every machine with clandestine speech
Just respect it man throw a fist in the air
As they crash in the worlds that trades only my words remain
Formulas of primordial audio
It was written so it shall be told
Bis is real cool when he's not Rip the Jacker
Vicarious logic of bodily hardship
Beat your ass till your teeth mash
For skin graft the patch over deep gash
Suspend me from the game don't mention my name
Separate the rappers from the actors
Can't speak with common sense
How much you wanna bet
Might throw a little fit
Drown you with a little spit
From the USA to Cairo
If there was no tomorrow
The speech is called double speak
For example if I said I was to bust the heat
Till the sky touch your feet
Open your eyes look at the concrete
My name ain't Germaine now you got the wrong beef
You think Hitler's dead but you got the wrong teeth
Being followed by a black cloud
I'll look up if you pass it around
I'm the best lyricist hands down
Motherfucker just look at your hands now
Only one problem my work com sucks
Syllables rush through the position of the teeth and the tongue
When I'm done I'll leave you needing a lung
Punch y'all for pair of fist cuffs with fist clutch
When I'm getting my dick sucked I resuscitate sick sluts
Stick a plug in the butt
OK Bis you been explicit enough
I love my home Atlanta
Those marijuana smokers them marijuana planters
I wake up in the morn
Just bought that NFL blitz and that basketball
I let my hair grow long maybe braid it in the fall
I just jump in my car
Sometimes I get annoyed
They treat me like a scrub
I go down to the schools
Maybe I'll get more love
I'm on the highway speeding
I guess I wasn't thinking
For more than 30 minutes I was stuck in gridlock prison
This traffic drives me crazy
Five a bitch almost made me
Crash into her Mercedes
I'm glad I almost missed her
I pushed the clutch and shifted
It was a white lady I'd rather hit a sister
Cause see I know the system
It's easier to trick them
You need some contacts you can't see
Don't panic just be patient
Give the bitch the wrong information
She'll probably never claim it scared of high insurance payments
I love my home Atlanta I love my home Atlanta I love my home Atlanta
The land of pretty peaches
Girls with round features
Start it off like what's your name
Tell me what's your age
I'm glad you feel that way
Come on and ride with me
I got that shrimp appetizer with that dark meat
If shorty wanna creep
I'll bring her home with me
Just bought some candles and that Carl Thomas CD
Been had that Keith Sweat
I know how to make it last
I ain't in no rush plus she like it rough
Keep your stuff locked leather and handcuffs
And those things you wrap around a man's you know what
Fix me a cup and sinker
I always love Atlanta
That's why I love Atlanta I love my home Atlanta I love my home Atlanta
As a youngster I was so damn bad
Used to drive up the Ave with no tags
Face all chipped up from the glass
If I get caught I'll just give them some cash
Other ones pull out behind the flash
Take the night stick and tap the glass
Tell me turn the music on it's on blast
Tell him that I'm lost and I need a map
Looking for a hotel to take a nap
It was good last year that's why I'm back
That's when they tried to hit me
His big fist barely missed me
I have my camera with me
I think I'll sue the city
I love this place Atlanta that's why I love Atlanta
I'm the real king of my kingdom
I make my women practice isolationism as soon as I get them
Run my world with an iron rod behind iron bars
Enclosed behind iron doors in a small iron box in the corner
Shielded behind fire walls with water doors
The rhyme slinging highlander Ripper rip you to live longer
Get strong every record that I record
Morph my arms into a sword and clothesline you running forward
You can't ignore Bis motherfucker I started this
Hot shit from a lava pit studied by oceanographers
At the oceans bottom with rocket ship sound effects
You ain't ill if you need time to think
Stay behind to follow up and demolish you fucks
Call me Mr. spit shit also known as toilet mouth
Y'all been warned about a million times
When I'm writing I'm impervious to fraud
My fine arts verbal collage is worthy of the gods
Lock myself in solitary six months at a time
Work at the university and teach sick fucks how to rhyme
Nobody's safe nobody can say that they great
Trap your soul in an electromagnetic face
Look in my eyes then look in my face
I'm always a University professor
So the most important people in this room are not us but the students
And I want to say to you kids who've come along
Because these are important issues
Even if they're not on the test
These are really important issues to you as a human being
And I hope that you won't... won't agree with me... won't agree with any of us
That you'll make your own minds up
But I hope you will think about them and talk about them
I spit so ferocious I can't stay focused
Spit rhymes and split skulls
From Fort Hood to Fort Green
Supreme lyricist with built antique twenty fusion inhibitors
Syllables caliber killing em
Throw a beat on and bless him
My rap cracks the thermostat reset the temp at 180 degrees
Talk to my agent and make sure the craft service is Jamaican
Spit hard and never got a dime
For the intelligent community that reads my lyrics
This is the precarious position of a rap star dead serious
A burning star quasar when I rhyme
Artwork of an undetermined design
Lightning bolt struck the pen and I wrote a few lines
Cook dinner on a terrace for you and your parents
Tell them I dig you out diligently
And you thinking about giving up everything so you can have twins with me
Pin you to the leather
I prove I can love you better in three seconds
Eyes wide shut the word is Fidelio
With R. Kelly showing his home amateur video
Produced by a pinto at the house
The best job in the world besides touring around
Rhythm and Blues get all the couscous no doubt
And when I'm singing R and B this is how it sounds
Young lady you look so fine
She make me want it in her mouth
Spend the budget and bounce
Beat her ass as soon as she step in the house
She blaming it on the drugs and the wine
Club seen is obscene I told you umpteen times
Ain't shit change but the dick sliding in and out of her
Ain't nobody looking out for her
The appointment with the casting coach counselor is really just about a nut
Ain't no photographer taking no snapshots of her
With no cardboard camera for no twenty dollars
Horsemen. Enforcement
The thirteenth member
Around the compound of 15 soldiers
Lead by four to start off the war
The elite and street sweep
I don't think I'm on the list
I'm just here for Free
You know I seen you at the Bad Boy for Life shoot
I remember when I connected eyes with you
I remember once staying up all night with you
I'm assuming you did the same because you cared
I think it was sexy how you said them verses like that
Specialize in weapon diagnostics
Just thinking about it got me supped up
Y'all done fucked up now
Fuck the fact I never had a hit
Just in case your show ain't tight
Step on stage and pace left or right
More lines to your forehead than Brian McKnight
Tell the Queen of the pride to come sit on my lap
Just give me a minute
A Mack eleven when I'm clapping a rap
You ain't even got the balls to rock on the track
And call your man back
Stop the bleeding with a Tampax
The creator of a greater sum
Updated lungs were created by the pyramid builders
Been profane before I had a name in the game
You the one with all the dough up in all the magazines
Till the gas bleed from the juke
And rap music is read in my book
Curriculum carpet bombing leave the street shook
The best rapper in the world reserves the right to decline
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Got you mother fuckers on stand by
You know I'm the best
That's the day I was gonna cut your throat
I seen my watch was twelve hours late and I missed the show
But none the less I'm glad that I finally reached you
Ever since the accident I've been dying to speak to you
I meant we should start a group
I just wanted you to recognize that I got talent too
I Just Wished You Cared
I been attending counseling and taking medicine
They showed me techniques to help me deal with pressure
Whenever I remembered that crazy night when I was being reckless
Right before I finished that last sentence
The next thing I knew I was under water and breathless
Till some fellows came and pulled me from the wreckage
In retrospect I probably should have used a gun to end it
And I was still feeling kind of drunk
The ambulance came and they put me on the stretcher
One of them was so concerned that they wouldn't leave
He hopped in the back of the ambulance and rolled up some trees
I just remember his voice talking to me
And fifty stitches for my wounds
I wanted to be an emcee
He let me write some rhymes and go on tour with him
And I'm writing the best rhymes of my life
He introduces me to people as his lyrical equal
Let me write a rhyme on his album and even produce a beat too
He's not the type to call you just because he needs something
You was looking at him the same way I'm looking at you
You see there's a little bit of Stan in all of us
Tell me where you think all of these record sales spawn from
How many emcees must get dissed
I'm valued as one of America's most prestigious breeds of rapper
With oral speeches and ghetto English
I know people who have written newspapers on me
It could also be Universal wasn't patient with me
The way they blatantly labeled me
Some satanically motivated rapper that was related to beef
And I never needed a team because I'm not as dumb as I seem
The trinity divided into a dozen light beams
The future I've seen has humbled my dreams
To come in famine and disease
How many emcees must get dissed
How many emcees must get dissed
Nowadays the truth is I got nothing to prove
But I heard him call my name a couple times
In a couple of his rhymes and I thought about it a couple of times
That's when I recognized what Stan was worth
The only man on Darth that could reverse the Cool J curse
Constantly taken Rip the Jacker back to my therapist
I wasn't prepared for this
Go use the Pythagoras theory and do the math on this
Add up every multi syllable paragraph
And tell me when you find it you dick riding bitch
Rhyme more sick than anybody out your clique
But still how many emcees must get dissed
How many emcees must get dissed
How many emcees must get dissed
How many emcees must get dissed
How many emcees must get dissed
You ain't show me love when you was at your apex
I had to keep the situation in check
I told you not to do Gone Till November
I wrote all your best lyrical lines
On the stage if you was tired I would spit them sometimes
Nobody knew you bit off my rhymes
The industry's all about game
Like liquid chocolate spilling all over they new white trainers
I just know that both y'all are trying my patience
I don't give a fuck about a beat I been rhyming for ages
Put the nozzle to your eyeball and tell you what not to do
Rip your tonsils out through your nostrils
Lock you in a time capsule and smash the console
Shit on you in reverse suck you into a brown hole
Suck the power out of your soul
Your nothing but a coward in a cold freezing with an hour to go
Like drug lords checking to see if it's talcum or coke
I could kill you by drowning the globe
Or I could just spit inside of a hole and put an ounce in your throat
It's a dick between your mothers thighs divided by PIE
I'm the sickest linguistically illicit lyrical misfit in the business
I've made the decision that my standards are above precision
If it ain't dope then don't spit it
Don't be sensitive and get on the defensive just practice your penmanship
If you can't spit at high temperatures then just quit
Rupture the blood vessels in your neck fucking with Rip
Got millions of blueprints on zip disks
Stock versions of sick verses that come with conversions kits
With a course every Thursday that teaches you how to burst like Rip
At the moment of truth I let you design the tattoos
It's just a couple rappers that don't want it to happen for you
Ragging on you like battling is all you can do
You didn't sell enough units to be honest with you
Ever since the third album I been mentioning you
I got your name on my arm I'm representing you
I just want you to listen to what I'm telling you
A lot of people don't wanna admit it
But I consider it a real privilege to bear witness to your lyrics
I keep you out the public eye for a reason
I keep your whereabouts secret
You constantly keep me behind wall of concrete
Lock me in the basement like a fucking zombie
If I was priority you would acknowledge me
You ain't shit neither you ain't got no college degree
Give me the keys to the garage I need to borrow the Jeep
And now its time to rip it to the jacker
No rapper could rap quite like I can
I had to rock to a beat like this to show you
Calling yourself the greatest is something you don't do
You can't rap or act my main man
And every lie you told just added up cause you wasn't man enough
Rape a rapper with a classic from his own masters
There's a rumor going around that I got dropped
200,000 albums sold at 10 dollars a pop
That's 3 million in 3 months so kiss my ass
All these magazines tried to steamroll me to death
See when you was making records like I need love
Plus I heard Simone was the high school slut
And she learned how to fuck before she knew how to cuss
You married a slut and had kids with her to cover up your hustle
You and your man Russell made a better couple
Your being watched even when you take a dump
The chairs at your label got ears and the walls got eyes
Your living one big lie the world just don't know
You take a polygraph test that shit would probably explode
The Greatest Liar Of All Time that cannot rhyme
That cannot shine as long as I'm alive
And that microphone on your arm will always be mine
Now you're in a world where the hunter becomes the hunted
And somebody keeps paging you putting 4321 in
You can't sleep at night thinking about the drama
Tell them the rhymes they wrote for you should have been a lot tighter
I'll do anything for the greatest loser of all time
I experimented with some syllables from the first to the third day
Are stone statues surrounded by Neolithic objects
To create a universe all I need
And they never had a scientific mind like me
After this album my message is done
Atomic thrust turn you into cosmic dust
Bomb your borders with Japanese spigot mortars
Recompose your composition to sawdust
Prepare the river sacrifice for my ritual rites
Reinforce my habitual likes and dislikes
In the form of an eagle on top of the Thebes Cathedral
With linen garments neatly wrapped around armpits
With monasteries in the mountains
The game is Chinese chess
Countless issues need to be addressed before the East nukes the West
The inconsistency of the text makes me complex
Marijuana plant owners smell my aroma
Confederate federal General Lee electric general
He'll mock your style
Travel a fiber optic mile before you can smile
So don't ask me why and don't ask how
Once it blends I can stop right then
Quantum coupling mechanisms and technical shit
Just define what is poetry and what is rap
I'll demonstrate how to effectively bridge the gap
The answer is simple in fact
Silly emcees can't see me lyrically or visually
They'll never be better than me
I'll triple team them with the Trinity severed in three and give them nine enemies
I transmit images over the distance
Those who hear my efforts got to give me the merit
Off lyrics alone I'm a legend
It's the way I put it together
People forget but the history will remember
Let the records show I resisted under the pressure
Regardless of whether I'm not a bestseller
Painting pictures for intelligent listeners
From any and all dispositions
The intellectual division of science and religion
People waste their momentum trying to defend it
I could fix the way they look at the world
They read all these books in a barrel but they can't think for themselves
Must be strong because no one ever helps Germaine
The Catholic faith will never be the same
You can be put in chains because you've got a Muslim name
Sent to Guantanamo Bay and tortured for days
These rats in the corporate race is fakes
Nobody ever gives you what they didn't already take
I mimic haters like flight simulators in air bases
Recovered from an inverted spin and now I'm famous
Those who respond to Rip the Jacker with hate
Show poor taste and only exacerbate their fate
And replaces me with a supercomputer automaton
I don't barter for time I'm a martyr to rhymes
And a selfless soldier with pride that was ordered to die
I was revived after I died
It had mired up my mind and showed me a sign
Let the world know the truth but it became my demise
You know we're even I don't owe you a dime
From the ink to my pen to my pad to the ink in my arm
And Rip the Jacker ain't too stubborn to say when he's wrong
Call the police squad and tell them I'm in room 1-0-5
Woke up in the cargo plane
The only sixteen you've got for now on is locked and loaded and in your hand
Deploy and detach on land. You're the man
Tell him to go to Hell in Arabic
You want product give me twenty dollars
One million page dissertation written on paper
My purification process is greater but thinly tapered
I've only got to say it once
Let there be light and I write a sentence
In the Cambrian carrying bacteria with antigens
The video camera is just as powerful when it records
Appalling footage of cops breaking the law
I've been accused of being internally preoccupied
Clinically induced impulses reveal what's hidden
Written prescriptions given by qualified clinicians
Lafayette pegboards be spinning on turntables
To determine the motor coordination available
Those able to speak what I spoke repeat my quotes
My systematic treatment approach be deep in their throats
I inject the frontal lobe of the brain with a lethal dose
Of unspeakable dope worse than opium smoke
Well spoken like Washington Post or a Fox News Network host
Resurrect Rip the Jacker to rip these rappers
In half the speed of a bulb flash fire will engulf that ass
Into a molehill of charcoal ash
Only to be blown away by a cold draft
It's a good thing I got patience
But it turned me into a quick learner all I need now is some luck
An underdog rapper but I closed that chapter
I deal with my adaptive difficulty faster
And question my projective technique as a rapper
It doesn't matter we've all got a dark side
Let's talk about the incredible rap flow
One of my integral attributes is to be lyrically tactful
I can prove who's nice and who's not an emcee
Through falsifiable scientific hypotheses
In recent times I find it's never been about the rhymes
The game is very politicized
Those who sympathize with they hearts and minds
In spite of whatever happens I'll love it till I die
Edit the edges with Avid
Please try to interpret the following passage
It's on when the crowd is cheering me on
In a single file line stretched out a mile long
Thermodynamics of the second law
Isolated physical systems lead toward greater disorder
Across the dry desert in the featureless sand
Water is secondary to the meaning of man
I know but I won't tell
That come from the love of Hip Hop and rap music
The scourge of the words I attack the Earth with
Confuse my shrink with English the publication refuses to print
Whatever life you live it's a quick sighted quiz
Make sure they grow dreads and they live on the edge
In the projects where they harvest the human crop
Organic robots that bleed when they get shot
If you can survive or thrive in the Jamaican ghetto
You deserve the Congressional Medal
My heart goes out to all the young bloods
The heart has reasons the mind knows not of
From the first to the twelfth month
My motto was to blaze all and spare none
In a glass with a ion beam for longevity.
He believed light could travel in multiples of C.
About rhymes while he was pruning his Banzais.
But he would never take it out his archives.
He wrote two songs per day
N was constantly was experimenting wit his wordplay.
He got a F but he deserved a A.
Complete enigmas wrapped in puzzles encrypted in language
With sound but without shape or signature.
Outside there was a shed wit an Oppenheimer lock.
So many rhymes that were intricately designed.
He WAS Poet Laureate of his time
The unparalleled malleable annunciation of a sentence.
Even though it sorta irked me.
A wise man sees failure as progress.
Wit a caricature that has no content.
Words of scorn are a disastrous tool.
My attitude is fucked up but admirable.
But I can't help you if you need a dub.
It's deep as fuck. I ain't seen it all but I seen enough.
Really unbelievable stuff.
I should leave this rap shit alone
I'm convinced now that more than truth is at stake
Euphemisms are misunderstood as mistakes
Since it became a lucrative profession. There's a misconception
Sometimes I say things I myself can't believe.
I can understand how it makes you miserable.
That's why I said it so vehemently.
And now its time to rip it to the jacker
No rapper could rap quite like I can
I had to rock to a beat like this to show you
Calling yourself the greatest is something you don't do
You can't rap or act my main man
And every lie you told just added up cause you wasn't man enough
Rape a rapper with a classic from his own masters
There's a rumor going around that I got dropped
200,000 albums sold at 10 dollars a pop
That's 3 million in 3 months so kiss my ass
All these magazines tried to steamroll me to death
See when you was making records like I need love
Plus I heard Simone was the high school slut
And she learned how to fuck before she knew how to cuss
You married a slut and had kids with her to cover up your hustle
You and your man Russell made a better couple
Your being watched even when you take a dump
The chairs at your label got ears and the walls got eyes
Your living one big lie the world just don't know
You take a polygraph test that shit would probably explode
The Greatest Liar Of All Time that cannot rhyme
That cannot shine as long as I'm alive
And that microphone on your arm will always be mine
Now you're in a world where the hunter becomes the hunted
And somebody keeps paging you putting 4321 in
You can't sleep at night thinking about the drama
Tell them the rhymes they wrote for you should have been a lot tighter
I'll do anything for the greatest loser of all time
Get acquainted to the one and the only
The ninety percent of my brain that I ain't even used yet
When the female egg will merge with the man's sperm
Then I'll attack you with words that's absurd
Check out the bizarre style that I display god
Kinda like when the biz went
Ain't just the name of the song
It's probably my favorite response
When I'm walking on the street or I'm out at the mall
And people be talking that blah blah blah
Like Han Solo when he got frozen in Star Wars
I'm great but I'm not the greatest
I'm crazy but I'm not the craziest
The industry tried to cave me and I was an arch angel
But they changed me into Damien
Lyrically gifted as fuck
And I'll be a star till the day that I'm gone
If they respond too late to the 911 call
They find you on the floor with a razor blade in your palm
Deep cuts an inch wide and 5 inches long
Paramedics feel for a pulse to see if you gone
The doctor swore that suicide was the probably cause
Feel lost when you hear me roar
Before he triggered the bomb he went
Let's not forget utterly impossible or
My scholastic aptitude is 1602
Physical proof that I'm the best at this
More then any of you rappers ever spit
By an administrative assistant with deep throat
Butt naked on the floor knee deep in some coke
Humping a ho tampering with the republican vote
Flying circles around you like flying saucers
Flying circles around the royal air force's flying fortress
Looking for a home taking all calls and offers
Notify the prince and the Duke of Earl
I've got rhymes like beads on an abacus
My styles totally out the bracket
Scientist in thick glasses and pocket protectors want to patent it
My talent is unmatched by any rapper in this rapping biz
By any rapper on this planet's grid
Rip the towel off then pour salt on him
Continue my verbal assault on him till its 12 in the morning
And turn into the werewolf monster on him
Smartest then any man in Scotland Yard is
English speaking MC in the European region
Rip you to pieces like communism leaflets
Without a jacket outside when its freezing
Get acquainted to the one and the only
The ninety percent of my brain that I ain't even used yet
When the female egg will merge with the man's sperm
Then I'll attack you with words that's absurd
Generate thought forms quicker than Concords
Or you might spend a weekend in the county morgue
With an unsuitable coffin that's way too small
And a deacon blessing your body at a funeral
Gotta stay positive focus on the protons
Before I battle total strangers
Ask Paradise if I'm nice
Take a flick with some guys and leave before the Polaroid dries
Reflecting over the times when I was signed
There's a million ways to die at the absolute least
One of those ways is messing with the Beast from the East
I'll cut through your epidermal layers with verbal lasers
Sharper then razors on the feet of Olympic ice skaters
Judges will smile with amazement till they facial muscles start aching
The most dedicated hip hop lyrical patron
I might move to Japan and marry me a Asian
I intertwine with rhymes like
I'll kick a rhyme that'll melt the Earth
And ask you in the afterlife if you felt the verse
That's why I can grow my marijuana properly
You are getting sleepy
And you're gonna buy 2000 BC
You are getting sleepy
And you're gonna buy 2000 BC
Soon as the air is released the rhyme launches
Take two totes and pass
Wait till my lyrics reach a critical mass to whip the GOATS ass
I speak with the silence syntax of insects
Extremely Low Frequencies to frequently flow
Underneath oak trees guarded by 13 flows
Searching for that pot of gold under the rainbow
Or searching for that big pot of platinum
Down at the bottom of the North Atlantic with the Titanic captain
I been rapping since rap happened
So stop being cocky and try me
In about 5 minutes if you think you can out rhyme me
To the Ghetto Superstar who plays the guitar
You should be standing in line for it
Ask anybody you see in the 5 Boroughs
It's not like I'm not black so cop that
Order the archers to burn up the forest
Then on the next morning I'll send you an army
I've robbed from the rich and taken from the poor
Sleep with many whores then see them no more
Oh my Lord I can't wait until tour
Cause them to die then run off with their wives
Then plan my escape for the day I'm betrayed
Nations for treasons and conquer their regions
Smash in their kingdoms and stomp on their leaders
Four figures of killers that's haunted by demons
Every time they cry in pain we drink wine
Laugh louder each time and drink more wine
We do a rain dance and SLIT ALL THEIR THROATS
Surely you just off with a dome
Let's bark these marks like Joan of Arc
Transform like James Earl Jones in Conan
Run through the fortress and let off the seasons
Beheaded and shredded in several pieces
Can't make simple mistakes
When the cavern's invaded
Like Arthur and the Dark Knights
Don't give me no shaky...
Girl you'll stand up right
Girl you'll stand up right
Virtuous women are envied by whores
Dangerous Jamaican thugs that came to bust
Now it's time to see me rock the beat properly
Negotiator said he let me go if acted civil
He didn't double cross me with that fake shaky love
Rip yo candy ass with a desert recipe book
The glitch in The Matrix
Face this capital punishment
Decapitate your whole crew then juggle your jugulars
Get up in the sky like frequent flies
You could be tall as the twin towers
And I still cut you down to size and drown you in a golden shower
Leave you tangled in semantics
Lost like Atlantis in Los Angeles
You wouldn't want me to unleash The Horseman in me
The contrasted calculations and inhibitions
Put a couple of provisions for the chemically imprisoned
They try to look through my eyes and develop the map
To the core in the center where the emperor's at
Run through bitches like kids in school yards
I tear off the roof like I'm Zeus
And squeeze till you cannot breathe
I walk around with crows over my head
Eagles that slide your name inside the funeral chapels
The second that the message arrive
For some it might blow by
Searching depths for the mind
Every sixth day I commit suicide
No vest come and test me then
All up in the juice and can't taste the gin
Cause loud mouth hustlers get snitched on it
I'm the truth and the answer with two balls that always double dribble
With acid that make me greater than thee
Just to leave your gutter red
We are not to be fucked wit
Melodies make music surround
Look what I did with a mouth and a pen
I bet y'all critics never doubt me again
Try to catch the thoughts that come out of my head
Look south of my chest and north of my legs
Of course we the best
Especially if he could bounce like this
He's possessed when he's on the microphone
He takes this more serious than just a poem
Even before Sean John Jr. was born
I ripped a 100 Bars before
And I rip 200 if you motherfuckers wanna see more
Horsemen spread like a rash of legions
Multiply like multiplication
Equivalent to the equation or combination
Only reason you ain't sucking my dick now is under exposure
Trying to sneak my way to top and fuck Oprah
Send aliens to smoke ya
I wear your rent in my left ear already
Put bodies in coffins and autograph us
This is the headquarters for horses
Dip the pork sausage in four different kind of Tabasco sauces
A Horseman's about to spit
Cockroaches come crawling out of they eyes
Beetles and worms eating up they insides
Amputate your tongue while it's still in ya mouth
Enforcement Swordsman
Where it's all about murder and extortion
Live underwater and grow gills
Made it hard to figure me
Vehicular manslaughter by 16 cars
Put a curse on ya whole family
Dressed in all black like The Omen
Should put y'all in a club and make y'all walk and pose
It's all about the Horsemen baby
It's all about the Horsemen baby
It's all about the Horsemen baby
It's all about the Horsemen baby
It's all about the Horsemen ladies
You don't have a broad enough bandwidth to understand Bis
If I ever get to rap behind you.
What about the freestyles I put on vinyl
Here's a FYI to I can rip
But you don't have the mental bandwidth to understand Bis
But when they get their feet chopped off
They can't walk the walk
In my former life my name was Ricardo
Lyrical linguistic twist shit like licorice sticks
I spit verses similar to curses
But ya condition just worsens
Play six feet Beneath the Surface
Along with the worms and the serpents
Some kind of divine therapist
Come back to the states as a terrorist
Cops touch me then I sever they wrist
Ask yourself what type of era this is
I step out the spot and merge like submarines
Cause the first thing in my eye sight is seen
There's absolutely no way to get me
The Ripper is more talented than Mr. Ripley
And more risky than circus gypsies
And still remember the first time that I removed the man's kidneys
Mini machetes sharper than wolverines
Leave clues behind for the forensics team that inspects the scene
A serial killing machine to the extreme
Truthfully the cut is too deep
My brain full of psychotics and madness
Then I throw on futuristic optic glasses
I come in sudden like a cobra's bite
My insight goes back to the Vulcan rights
Ain't no way Horsemen stop
Ain't no way Horsemen stop
Ain't no way Horsemen stop
Each day I dip sometimes I trip
I just don't give a fuck
I gallop role I'm in control
White air force ones with the low cut
Don't call me unless you invite some sluts
I pay big books to get my dick sucked
A Benjamin Franklin was more than enough
Write your number down I'll be in touch
A Benjamin Franklin was more than enough
Bitch give me that cash before I fuck you up
Genuine banging in the deck
Smash and dip with hollow tips
One ... two ... three...
It came to me like God's word
Told them not to try nothing funny or I'd kill them all
They still never responded
I told them for the third and final time
Three of the hostages started crying
Three organs three inches away from my heart
And you can't do all of the beats yourself
You can't do it without the streets help
I use to rhyme like all day
I use to train with myself in the mirror
That's the difference between you and me
I'm just in the booth right now
I definitely ain't scared of you
Just as long as I get to damage you
If you a lion I'm a tiger too
Look you in the eyes and lie to you
A whole clip of rhymes before you can get off one round
I pulverize mother fuckers
Fifteen Megatons of TNT
The overseas block buster
A ground underneath the ground of all underground bunkers
Conducting excavations of the matrix
Of women who use artificial insemination
As barren as Utah's Salt Lake City basin
As barren as ancient Egypt before irrigation
With blood stains on my apron
Then garlic bread sticks in their eye sockets and taste them
It's not really that odd
When you consider part of the Asian culture loves to eat dogs
Hindus in India will kneel to the floor
And worship cows and rats as gods
And beyond to the nearest binary star
For more than thirty minutes I was stuck in gridlock prison
I got that shrimp appetizer with that dog meat
Just bought some candles and that Carl Thomas CD
As a young child I was so damn bad
Used to drive up the Ave with no tags
Face all chipped up from the glass
Running from the police hauling ass
Other ones pull up behind the flash
Take a nightstick and tap the glass
Tell them that I'm lost and I need a map
Looking for a hotel to take a nap
It was good last year that's why I'm back
That's when he tried to hit me
His big fist barely miss me
I have my camera with me
I think I'll sue the city
I love this place Atlanta
That's why I love Atlanta
I love my home Atlanta
I done been from Jersey to Brooklyn
Done been through Queens where the crooks hang
Really love it when a girl got a cute name
Got a cute attitude and a cute frame
Done seen a lot more than some loose change
Do Egyptian love with two hands
Sometime spend a whole day outdoors
Music got us in that mood
Every night I go down to the city man
Them stripper chicks know how to strip man
Them hoes be thick but sick man
Every stripper think a motherfucking rich man
Think I got a bank account with a million man
Case of Crystal cost about six grand
Bitch better get a less expensive brand
How about tickets to my next five shows
You know my elbow just brushed your thigh
I be up in this club all the time
But it's the first time that I crossed the line
You know how these stripper chicks love to tease
I think I left my cell phone back at my seat
I had a couple of drinks and I need a receipt
Follow me to the bathroom to pee
I keep about three G's in my briefs
Been on America's Most and still can't be captured
In a world where it seems like you're all alone
Like my name didn't help the rap market grow
When I deserved to die old and broke
A friend of mine told me that I know a lot of nothing
I looked him in the eyes and said at least I know something
I know I've been driving all night through the rain
I be the first one to tell you I'm an ill emcee
I paid that price a couple of times
I ain't scared of the competition
I hope you never have to feel my pain
I hope you never have to drive all night through the rain
I guess I'll plead guilty if
I'm verbally inclined to shine
I drive through the rain till the roads get dry
You could never put a price on my pride
But I won't disappear and I will not be quiet
Keep my eyes and ignore the pain
No matter how long I gotta drive through the rain
And even though that might seem like a short time
I was never known for spitting a short rhyme
I'm known for my ill metaphors and lines
And I'm inspired by that little voice inside
Everyone takes turns getting what they deserve
I'm just dumbing it down for a minute
Bought a cheap ticket and split
I'm in coach sitting next to this chick with some real voluptuous lips
She asked me if I can help her give her luggage a lift
I thought about how I spent so much time in the East
And how my mind was never in peace
Seen some guy holding up a sign with my name
Fans sing along when I perform on stages
Check out the bizarre style that I display god
Kinda like when the biz went
Ain't just the name of the song
It's probably my favorite response
When I'm walking on the street or I'm out at the mall
And people be talking that blah blah blah
Like Han Solo when he got frozen in Star Wars
I'm great but I'm not the greatest
I'm crazy but I'm not the craziest
The industry tried to cave me and I was an arch angel
But they changed me into Damien
Lyrically gifted as fuck
And I'll be a star till the day that I'm gone
If they respond too late to the 911 call
They find you on the floor with a razor blade in your palm
Deep cuts an inch wide and 5 inches long
Paramedics feel for a pulse to see if you gone
The doctor swore that suicide was the probably cause
Feel lost when you hear me roar
Before he triggered the bomb he went
Let's not forget utterly impossible or

A Benjamin Franklin was more than enough
Write your number down I'll be in touch
A Benjamin Franklin was more than enough
Bitch give me that cash before I fuck you up
Genuine banging in the deck
Smash and dip with hollow tips
I heard you got beats
And turned it up loud to see if had some real beats
And I ain't even got to work with him yet
He showed up after me and forgot to bring his own DAT tapes
He shook my hand with both of his hands
And told me he could play it over again with both of his friends
I don't give a fuck who really produced the shit
You know we ain't got a budget
People wanna keep on talking
People wanna keep on talking
Why can't they see they're too weak for me
People wanna keep on talking
People wanna keep on talking
Let's talk about some of the things YOU go through
Sometimes you just want to just explode and spread across the globe
You wanna let the whole world know
Everybody that talked about me is somebody I owe
And I STILL took his crown with a unanimous vote
You can talk about my album and all of my songs
And I swear on my government name Germaine
You can stay talking about ice
I talk about who's nice in the rap game and who got stripes
I got a passion for this rapping
I control your vertical and your horizontal
What you talk about and who you talk to
You got a day job and you wanna spit a hundred bars
I ripped the Jacker with his own track
You know this rap game is a lot like high school
And high school is a lot like life
You need to identify the qualities that separate you from those around you
Free from the things you want people to remember about you
But also free from the things you want them to forget
I don't know if that freedom exists for me anymore
And even though I dream about what it would be like
And whether the people who talk bad about you know it or not
They really save you from obscurity every time they mention your name
They put a quarter in your immortal meter
They practically do the opposite of what they want to do
When you motherfuckers finally figure it out
In his search to the key for immortality
And his words meant nothing
He never gave you anything to talk about
You are now rocking with the best to bust
Take small change as long as I can afford range
I remember was no other soldier like me
Airborne spores reach overseas with light breeze
Spending per diem with a real nicely tanned Korean
You couldn't see me with a Jacob piece from Jesus
I'll lean you back like your spine just cracked
There ain't an emcee that can stop me
That's what you get for disagreeing with God
They ain't got no lip for the beast
From the hip to get leverage if you more than four deep
Got a pistol grip hawk with a chrome beak
Shorty want to know how the flesh work
You must have smoked something I used to call Pool Hall crack
Spread you over your background like bogus art
If I coughed in my fist when I opened my hand
Till the four got sore and had to make two more
In a whole other state of mind
Mexican standoffs waste lives but they save time
I sweep the streets with a fleet bigger than the Greeks
Till we occupy your land like thieves
Back to change the view of Hip Hop from that bullshit
Back to mash up beats that bang up your Ave and streets
Shootouts between rap stars driving fast cars
A slug to the stomach make a thug move sluggish
Crawling in his bloodiness no matter how big the gun is
I got a message bout I got a court summons
We can both split half of what we took from you
I attacked you because annual tax was due
But I run with the vets on the streets
The rhyme weapon legend
This got to be the biggest track I ever touched in my life
I've got the olive green marine fatigues off for sensitive like
Got that seven figure dollar smell
She come check me at the telly in a mini with the longest L
Till the pressure started popping her ears
She thought it would last forever but I told her I was dropping this year
But while I'm here I'd like to thank
The rhymes always on time when I say shit
On the tour bus they searching the coach
You all know my name so I guess I'll just start this
I'm so swift and that's a natural fact
That you can picture like a photo
Mad tricks up the sleeve wear boxers so my dick can breathe
You know it's all terrific
I just want to see you pump yo fist
I don't want to hear y'all talk no shit
I just want to get on stage and show the gift
You can't sell crack on the block no more
I Jackie Chan up the wall and sit in the dark
Or go running for a jog while I spit in the park
Me and you in the sandbox with our hands locked
Get the same shit your man with the broken hand got
My broad with the fat ass can sit up front
Your broad that look like trash can sit in the trunk
Break off a big chunk of skunk and take off with a blunt
Like they never heard a jam like this
When I say friends I mean a couple buddies of mine
From the beginning to the end is connected to the beginning like infinity symbols
Misunderstanding is still a form of understanding
Try to act like you don't know who it is
It's like if you ain't a mogul they don't know who you is
But I'm a ogre in the biz with the vocals and libs
Said so much crazy shit on my last album
My name shut Interpol down for two hours
Now that's true power
Just listen to the vibes and blend in with the signal you getting
Quick blow break off your limp wrist bones
Punchlines on the song through the hook and all
You acting like you think you too good to fall
If I was focused I could crush you
My little arms carry big arms
When people see you they don't know that it's not me
Try to catch me but I got you
I got a mind that spins like belt drives
But I got an idea to bring it back to life
Let me find out this album ain't the one to cop
Beats bang like sounds of shots inside the chamber
I played the bench for a while but I'm back to the leather
Fucking dogs and the college women
We speak the same language I ain't gotta explain it
My reputation was predicted by the ancients
2000 BC they was saying the same shit
A crystal bottle of venom
These rhymes is poisonous boy you will die trembling
Go ahead Bis let the vampire van touch them
My fan base sit and wait for the coming
These Rolls gold Remy's look bigger than twenties
Nominated for being underrated
We made a name for ourselves but I guess Common was the only one that made it
I clapped when he won his award
If you ever need me again just reach out
I got poses that belong on posters
Pour out all my emotions and double what the gross is
I want to thank my mother
I want to thank my brother
I don't want to bite nobody's throat
The lifestyle of Germaine is my brainchild
Germaine is really like the black John Wayne
Back then I didn't understand the music business
Every agent found it hard to find me
They don't know how you done this shit
This is the beginning of the rest of my life
Muzzle flashes a light that says goodbye to life
From a bloodline that's closer to yours than mine
You ignore the signs but we all divine
Sharp enough to read your mind I can hear your applause in silence
They don't know how you done this shit
They don't know how you done this shit
You should thank God for answering your prayers
I'll rip a show for a beer and a smoke
Used to be the type of emcee they were scared to approach
Ricocheting through your man's and you
They've got a lot of anger for you
Switch places with the person that was banishing you
They don't know how you done this shit
They already would've done this shit
He's usually on the thumb you lift
That's what I would say if I had to make a statement
Salvation without authentication
False pagans bought lawmakers to orchestrate how the law changes
Inspired speeches got fans fighting in bleachers
They can't keep quiet neither
I want to team up with the best there is
The deep life I live is shallow to sheep
They don't know how you done this shit
They don't know how you done this shit
They already would've done this shit
Hey little babe your changing
Babe are you feeling sore
Ain't no use in pretending
Don't wanna play no more
Who got a full scholarship at St. John's to ball
She was on her way to church late for worship
She praying that he quit hustling
She know his older brother got him into weed smuggling
Can't believe he messing with that stuff again
He push weight from state to state
His shipment's never late to make the deadline dates
He got twenty unconfirmed but known women that he all hitting
He just anxious for his record to drop
The music industry watched as it shot to the top
He got the hottest video on The Box
Approaching the car with his hand on his firearm
Just like something he wrote in a song before
My flow glow brighter than any diamond that you know
Holding himself up with his thumb on a stump
Get a Hummer for the summer to stunt
And just sit in the front while my lungs become one with a blunt
How could you respect one of the best
Bet me who got the best flow
You end up with less doe
Behind the scenes they put me on death row and won't let go
Brace yourself while I break the chains
My beats bang so hard they erase the plains
Salute or I'll smash you
Salute or I'll smash you
Salute or I'll smash you
Salute or I'll smash you
The sergeant major honorably discharged me
My life too rough for me not to recognize rough
The soldier's back to blow a fucking hole through rap
I wish they'd let me out the cage and stop holding me back
You might say the only thing holding me back is myself
It ain't hard to tell what's holding me back is my sales
But I'm an artist in an ignorant world
World class athlete trained to attack beats
I remember when I was primitive too
The older advise the younger when they recognize the hunger
Launch everything when I'm locked in
Tried to play jump rope with skis on and got dropped when you hopped in
You don't speak it but it's no secret
A sixty second round is a nice pace
Tell him he can hide the bruise on his face with nightshade
If you looking for a battle you came to the right place
This is Mic Club and over here I'm the Mic Ace
Salute or I'll smash you
Salute or I'll smash you
Salute or I'll smash you
Salute or I'll smash you
And now its time to rip it to the jacker
No rapper could rap quite like I can
I had to rock to a beat like this to show you
Calling yourself the greatest is something you don't do
You can't rap or act my main man
And every lie you told just added up cause you wasn't man enough
Rape a rapper with a classic from his own masters
There's a rumor going around that I got dropped
200,000 albums sold at 10 dollars a pop
That's 3 million in 3 months so kiss my ass
All these magazines tried to steamroll me to death
See when you was making records like I need love
Plus I heard Simone was the high school slut
And she learned how to fuck before she knew how to cuss
You married a slut and had kids with her to cover up your hustle
You and your man Russell made a better couple
Your being watched even when you take a dump
The chairs at your label got ears and the walls got eyes
Your living one big lie the world just don't know
You take a polygraph test that shit would probably explode
The Greatest Liar Of All Time that cannot rhyme
That cannot shine as long as I'm alive
And that microphone on your arm will always be mine
Now you're in a world where the hunter becomes the hunted
And somebody keeps paging you putting 4321 in
You can't sleep at night thinking about the drama
Tell them the rhymes they wrote for you should have been a lot tighter
I'll do anything for the greatest loser of all time
I'm so high in the clouds I gotta aim down
Lyrically I'm six foot one from the waist down
Lay down or taste rounds from the trey pound
Kiss the ground as you lay face down
Ghetto life is a death sentence
These uncreative ungrateful scum
Let me show you how the fire work over here son
Unless life is a luxury that you don't want
I'm as smooth as smooth can get
I shake your hand to bruise your neck to improve your breath
Outside the bones but inside the flesh
Like a horse or a supercharged Mustang Ford
Now I only got a couple more bars to pounce ya
And do curls and destroy you in front of the world
Maybe it's because you puff the same shit I bent on
I've managed to draw the silhouette of God
Connect the dots with stars till my C forms
Grab the CD without tongs or gloves on
And see if it don't barbecue your palms and arms
Tear the club down with a warning and leave
Conduct business with broads that fuck for the cream
Giving angels anal through halos
I pitch back and forth like a lion in a cage
Kill me you gotta deal with a battalion behind me
I unzip my own flesh and step out my skin
Microscopes couldn't find defects in my design
This the template real emcees should abide by
Let me wipe the mucus out the side of your mind's eye
And I never lost a battle motherfucker don't front
They ain't got no lip for the beast
From the hip to get leverage if you more than four deep
I check to make sure it's no leaks
That's why I hit the gym till my chest hurt
Outside the bones but inside the flesh
The most lyrical digital streams the world has ever seen
People laying on the concrete exhausted from heat
Watching John Kerry spit over some Michael Moore beats
This is a little something that my repertoire boast
I almost was in control of all coasts
But I can be as quiet as they want me to be
They up on 106 on BET talking to Free
Who gives a FUCK if your ankles is buff
Cause you can't hold me back with black ball number eight
I pick the microphone up and spark the debate
My sense of speed is ten over three
MC times Kay Slay over the motherfucking MP
They couldn't follow the leader long enough so I drug them
Even from a distance I got a front row seat
Your favorite artists are Mafia bosses
From the streets to the corporate office of they lawyers
The side of the street shit the TV don't show
Every day they address change
The mainstream think they just rapping
They don't have the eyes or ears to see or hear what's happening
We represent Jamaican pride
There's a lot of sexy beasts in the system that like men more than women
Can't see it without the criminal vision
Motherfuckers is living a life nobody ain't filming
Feds putting smoke detectors with bugs in ceilings
I'm a soldier but I squeeze with a delicate hand
That's why I moved the fuck out of New York to a less busier town
Hollering ride or die
Man of flesh with the eyes of God
A concrete bunker protects my mind so I cry inside
While I watch how the media designed the lies
There's a hundred million dollars on the line every time
I'm ready to place a bet any time
Empty a whole nine into any shield you hide behind
To breach your contract with Father Time
Send the last digit on a bullet through a barrel
My hundred pound rucksack full of ammo and army apparel
You couldn't see me with Jacob piece from Jesus
I lean you back like your spine just cracked
Rhyme chiropractor get paid to adjust raps
Before I leave I remind you to remember you're whack
There ain't an MC that can stop me
Change your style cause its time
I'm just a ghost of rip
I relocate so quick they can't close the net
On the loose again nobody knows what's next
Every machine with clandestine speech
Just respect it man throw a fist in the air
As they crash in the worlds that trades only my words remain
Formulas of primordial audio
It was written so it shall be told
Bis is real cool when he's not Rip the Jacker
Vicarious logic of bodily hardship
Beat your ass till your teeth mash
For skin graft the patch over deep gash
Suspend me from the game don't mention my name
A jam that you love but don't be getting no airplay
They auditioning for the wrong part
Like a mosquito bite in the dark
Get your chest pressed in
Leave you dead in Best Western
I don't want to waste no lyrics talking about you
Just let my body die and rot in hell why don't you
I microphone this with my own way of doing things
All my rhymes really do is provoke you to think
People don't care about your passion when they coming at you
All they ever see is record sales and dollar value
The bottom line is I need a bigger budget
Advertising is how you program the public
People don't have to understand to love something
I might as well do what I do best
And that's rip a microphone to shreds
I move like my shadow is weightless
Transmitting from an undisclosed location
Pirate stations with phantom frequency modulations
The bad news is I got a tight flow
Swimmers in my saliva river drown when I give it to them
The viscosity of my spit lubricates the track
Listen to the words bouncing off the lungs in my chest
You don't have a broad enough bandwidth to understand Bis
If I ever get to rap behind you.
What about the freestyles I put on vinyl
If you ever heard I'm not the best you being lied to
Here's a FYI to I can rip
But you don't have the mental bandwidth to understand Bis
But when they get their feet chopped off
Put a suit on you still look whack
The microphone shark tear your bones apart
Spread you over your background like bogus art
Cold and dark as a cobra's heart
The metaphor make a voice like Lord Vader
I'm a chip off the old block like Uncle L
Try to act like you don't know who it is
It's like if you ain't a mogul they don't know who you is
But I'm a oldie in the biz with the vocals and libs
Said so much crazy shit on my last album
My name shut Interpol down for two hours
Now that's true power
I create what I can't count to rhyme from my anger management counselor
Just listen to the fives and blend in with the signal you getting
Quick blows break off your limp wrist bones
Punchlines on the song through the hook and all
If I was focused I could crush you
Your body armor don't protect you from your karma
I got a mind that spins like belt drives
And when I seen hip hop die I felt cries
But I got an idea to bring it back to life
Take small change as long as I can afford range
Jason Jermaine Bourne Williams is a false name
I remember was no other soldier like me
Airborne spores reach overseas with light breeze
Out in Waikiki with keys and cheese
Red stuff comes out of squibs like a Hollywood script
Cardiologists hook up the heart monitors quick
The audible probability probably ain't probable
Helicopters stabilize at low altitudes
I'm talking to the negotiator laying out the rules
Under orders not to shoot but they break your vertebra with boots
And if I'm rapping sloppy G's got me
Blow out ya brain in your casket
Where slugs crush your melanin dome
Chrome that's known to break bones in an elephant
Chips in the field of fortune
Dead men walking with hits on the grills
Witness G Rap put it back in perspective
Leave ya brains on the dash in your Lexus
Bitches in draws with dick in their jaws
I ain't bitter but if I give you the finger it'll be behind a trigger
Up at radio telling them what you're going to do to me
My orders are to smoke you if you get too close
The whole globe is scared of my flow
Nowadays it's like I'm scared to be known
The methods of my motivation is completely subjective
My perception is completely parallel to perspective
Rhyming is the reason I spit in faces
Habituation of my flamboyance without rational reservation
And shots blow all them cowards and foes
The blood trail lead to a corpse
Treat my appetite for greed with a torch
Roll up my hand sheets with the force
You die forty foul dooms for forty coward moves
Propane in the form of flames spray when I point the barrel your way
You'll see a smoke cloud the darkest shade of charcoal gray
Stash steel in the field over the hill by the lake
While I stab you in the navel with a quill
Magazines once said I was the grateful hope
Some washed up bloke that couldn't execute what he wrote
Waves engulfed my boat but I managed to float
From now till the day that I croak
In a year I'm liable to be on a yacht in the ocean
You got less than a minute left to recognize the voice
Cause it pours when it rains out in Washington state
Right now I live inside a base
There's military police on every street
Motherfuckers be amazed by how cool I keep
To the left of your head and see a red beam on the wall
My gun's got grenade launchers on the bottom
One of which went on to be a successful actor
The phone probably rang two times then I answered
He told me that DEF JAM wanted to ban me
They add so much credibility to elaborate schemes
Internet chat rooms with live feeds
Of a rapper being eaten alive by live bees
Sound barriers like the Lockheed
That's a rhyme from like 9-3
If I'm high when I speak the knowledge is deep
They served me court papers in the studio I did this in
Missing from society because they lied to me
They didn't want to accept my doctrine of society
I studied with hundreds of scientists and science teams
Somewhere in Afghanistan USA survival teams
Keep an eye on their surroundings in the jihad regime
On my album out next spring
I promised myself I wouldn't shoot it without that scene
Germaine Williams that's my name
And occasionally Rip the Jacker but never Stan
Get it through your head and don't ask me again
It so happens I'm looking for a copy I could buy
A lot of y'all shine but y'all can't rhyme
And it's about time that I put y'all in line
Twist your mind with twisted rhymes
As weird as Michael Jackson's nose from the side
If you hear the engine knocking just pull over to the side
I guess it hasn't been serviced in all this time
Old school rappers I wouldn't be around without
Ain't got shit to say but keep putting albums out
Don't let what I said get you upset
About to rip y'all with the raw shit y'all
Never been the type to talk
A hundred times more sharper than stainless steal razors
The stench of a thousand ounces
Don't give a fuck what month you dropping in
With pictures of you with a dick in your mouth and a dick in your ass
I blur your vision like slow shutter speeds on the camera
Get up in that ass like colon cancer
Brain cells handpicked
Organically enhanced with third millennium medical standards
By genetic engineers with scholarship grants that studied at Stanford
Make you nauseous till you vomit
As I drink the blood of a thousand emcees
You should be afraid of my fangs in your neck draining you
Get your head flown if you dumb in the dome
Or struck with some stones till you feel numb in the bones
You better keep your big mouth closed
In the direction of my wrist bone to release your soul
But you chose the other route and got blown full of holes
Write your name on your tombstone scribbled in blood
Give me a little love
Seen him in the Pun video holding up his lighter
Flip and dip like shrimps and scampi
Switch language like a black kid raised by a Spanish nanny
And we do it like that when we in the dungeon
I'm the real king of my kingdom
I make my women practice isolationism as soon as I get them
Run my world with an iron rod behind iron bars
Enclosed behind iron doors in a small iron box in the corner
Shielded behind fire walls with water doors
The rhyme slinging highlander Ripper rip you to live longer
Get strong every record that I record
Morph my arms into a sword and clothesline you running forward
You can't ignore Bis motherfucker I started this
Hot shit from a lava pit studied by oceanographers
At the oceans bottom with rocket ship sound effects
You ain't ill if you need time to think
Stay behind to follow up and demolish you fucks
Call me Mr. spit shit also known as toilet mouth
Y'all been warned about a million times
When I'm writing I'm impervious to fraud
My fine arts verbal collage is worthy of the gods
Lock myself in solitary six months at a time
Work at the university and teach sick fucks how to rhyme
Nobody's safe nobody can say that they great
Trap your soul in an electromagnetic face
Look in my eyes then look in my face
You ain't show me love when you was at your apex
I had to keep the situation in check
I told you not to do Gone Till November
I wrote all your best lyrical lines
On the stage if you was tired I would spit them sometimes
Nobody knew you bit off my rhymes
The industry's all about game
Like liquid chocolate spilling all over they new white trainers
I just know that both y'all are trying my patience
I don't give a fuck about a beat I been rhyming for ages
Put the nozzle to your eyeball and tell you what not to do
Rip your tonsils out through your nostrils
Lock you in a time capsule and smash the console
Shit on you in reverse suck you into a brown hole
Suck the power out of your soul
Your nothing but a coward in a cold freezing with an hour to go
Like drug lords checking to see if it's talcum or coke
I could kill you by drowning the globe
Or I could just spit inside of a hole and put an ounce in your throat
It's a dick between your mothers thighs divided by PIE
I'm the sickest linguistically illicit lyrical misfit in the business
I've made the decision that my standards are above precision
If it ain't dope then don't spit it
Don't be sensitive and get on the defensive just practice your penmanship
If you can't spit at high temperatures then just quit
Rupture the blood vessels in your neck fucking with Rip
Got millions of blueprints on zip disks
Stock versions of sick verses that come with conversions kits
With a course every Thursday that teaches you how to burst like Rip
At the moment of truth I let you design the tattoos
It's just a couple rappers that don't want it to happen for you
Ragging on you like battling is all you can do
You didn't sell enough units to be honest with you
Ever since the third album I been mentioning you
I got your name on my arm I'm representing you
I just want you to listen to what I'm telling you
A lot of people don't wanna admit it
But I consider it a real privilege to bear witness to your lyrics
I keep you out the public eye for a reason
I keep your whereabouts secret
You constantly keep me behind wall of concrete
Lock me in the basement like a fucking zombie
If I was priority you would acknowledge me
You ain't shit neither you ain't got no college degree
Give me the keys to the garage I need to borrow the Jeep
I look around I see a whole lot of kids like me
Raw metaphors keep you high for months
I got the shotgun pumped
I possess the lyrical ammo to battle
And rip any one of you warm blooded mammals to shambles
The type of MC you can't outdo
I'll battle you over the...
I'll battle you over a blank check
I'll battle you with a gun to my neck
In a stolen car with the VIN number ripped out
They ain't got no lip for the beast
From the hip to get leverage if you more than four deep
I check to make sure it's no leaks
That's why I hit the gym till my chest hurt
This got to be the biggest track I ever touched in my life
I've got the olive green marine fatigues off for sensitive like
Got that seven figure dollar smell
She come check me at the telly in a mini with the longest L
Till the pressure started popping her ears
She thought it would last forever but I told her I was dropping this year
But while I'm here I'd like to thank
The rhymes always on time when I say shit
On the tour bus they searching the coach
You all know my name so I guess I'll just start this
I'm so swift and that's a natural fact
That you can picture like a photo
Mad tricks up the sleeve wear boxers so my dick can breathe
The rhyme weapon legend
The rhyme weapon legend
If I coughed in my fist when I opened my hand
Till the four got sore and had to make two more
In a whole other state of mind
Mexican standoffs waste lives but they save time
I sweep the streets with a fleet bigger than the Greeks
I'm back for the music
Back to do exclusives
Back to change the view of Hip Hop from that bullshit
Back to mash up beats that bang up your Ave and streets
Shootouts between rap stars driving fast cars
A slug to the stomach make a thug move sluggish
Crawling in his bloodiness no matter how big the gun is
I got a message bout I got a court summons
We can both split half of what we took from you
I attacked you because annual tax was due
That's what we back to do
The rhyme weapon legend
Your body armor don't protect you from your karma
Why I keep a tight leash on the gun
She the second broad I ever humped under a bridge
She don't know Desi is a greasy fucking pig
And he set me up for something he knows I never did
Like the way I look at lyrics
Got skills to kill the rap business
Get buried with your cash and gold
They don't know how you done this shit
This is the beginning of the rest of my life
Muzzle flashes a light that says goodbye to life
From a bloodline that's closer to yours than mine
You ignore the signs but we all divine
Sharp enough to read your mind I can hear your applause in silence
They don't know how you done this shit
They don't know how you done this shit
You should thank God for answering your prayers
I'll rip a show for a beer and a smoke
Used to be the type of emcee they were scared to approach
Ricocheting through your man's and you
They've got a lot of anger for you
Switch places with the person that was banishing you
They don't know how you done this shit
They already would've done this shit
He's usually on the thumb you lift
That's what I would say if I had to make a statement
Salvation without authentication
False pagans bought lawmakers to orchestrate how the law changes
Inspired speeches got fans fighting in bleachers
They can't keep quiet neither
I want to team up with the best there is
The deep life I live is shallow to sheep
They don't know how you done this shit
They don't know how you done this shit
They already would've done this shit
But I guess Common was the only one that made it
I clapped when he won his award
Me you and Spike Lee used to sit and freestyle
I got poseurs that belong on posters
Pour out all my emotions and double what the gross is
Everybody in the box office know the flow sick
I wanna thank you all
The lifestyle of Jermaine is my brainchild
Every agent found it hard to find me
I don't wanna hear y'all talk no shit
I just wanna get on stage and show the gift
You can't sell crack on the block no more
I Jackie Chan up the wall and sit in the dark
Or go running for a jog while I spit in the park
Me and you in the sandbox with our hands locked
Get the same shit your man with the broken hand got
My broad with the fat ass can sit up front
Your broad that look like trash can sit in the trunk
I'm gonna fuck till I break off chunks
Break off a big chunk of skunk and take off with a blunt
I got a deadly disease without a vaccine
Bend your mental from the beginning to the end
Is connected to the beginning like infinity symbols
Misunderstanding is still a form of understanding
I wanna do so many things to you
And let me tell you what I think of you
She hot when she in front but she stand behind a brother
Let me see what I might wanna get into
Then wake up in the Bahamas after we done made up
Said the guy at the front desk recognized me
And told her all about me...
I told her I'd let her have the next grand that I touched
Walked back to the elevator with my hand on her butt
I hopped up and blazed one
I told her I don't really like to come through her block
Cause the blueberry drop attract too many cops
My flow glow brighter than any diamond that you know
Holding himself up with his thumb on a stump
Get a Hummer for the summer to stunt
And just sit in the front while my lungs become one with a blunt
Behind the scenes they put me on death row and won't let go
Brace yourself while I break the chains
My beats bang so hard they erase the plains
The sergeant major honorably discharged me
My life too rough for me not to recognize love
The soldier's back to blow a fucking hole through Rap
I wish they'd let me out the cage and stop holding me back
You might say the only thing holding me back is myself
It ain't hard to tell what's holding me back is my sales
But I'm an artist in an ignorant world
World class athlete trained to attack beats
I remember when I was primitive too
The older advise the younger when they recognize the hunger
Launch everything when I'm locked in
Tried to play jump rope with skis on and got dropped when you hopped in
You don't speak it but it's no secret
A sixty second round is a nice pace
Tell him he can hide the bruise on his face with nightshade
If you looking for a battle you came to the right place
I rep the Rude Boy Natty Dread posse
The markings on my arm was drawn
They symbolize the art of Hip Hop in it's rawest form
We can take it to the stage like we going to war
Low crawling through the crowd we perform on tour
Every day is a piece of eternity that we control
That's why Rap music feeds the soul
Here's a hot one for you to hold
The underground give me credit when I'm sound checking
I feel like it's now or never
I can't recite something without tight substance
They auditioning for the wrong part
Like a mosquito bite in the dark
Master of self but a slave to the rhythm
I'm a marksman spend my free time at the range
Sit your five dollar ass down before I lay change
One spit flames call a fireman
Sixteens hit like the bird flu and my word true
I could dial seven digits and get you hurt dude
Prozac washed down with Grey Goose and lime and
The street lights illuminates the crooked runway
Toward a narrow path of 40 odors and gun play
The air will dry your body like salt tears in the sun's rays
Law enforcement officers flash badges like passports
Follow us into a new era
Whack lyrics and a hot beat makes your song irrelevant
I'm a poet so it takes more than punchlines to move me
He said I was a soldier in lyrical combat
Other people slandered my name but I dodged that
They don't see the missing pieces my thesis provides rap
Cause that's what my master would do if he was asked to
The most lyrical digital streams the world has ever seen
The airborne attack you can't call off
Breathe exhaust like a horse or a supercharged Mustang Ford
This is a little something that my repertoire boast
I almost was in control of all coasts...
But I can be as quiet as they want me to be
They up on 106 on BET talking to Free
Who gives a fuck if your ankles is buff
I pick the microphone up and spark the debate
But I don't know if I'm right no more
But I don't know if I'm right no more
I walk where no man dares
So the world could share one man's fair
My cares are your cares
Your tears are my tears
I eavesdrop on your prayers
The industry could not stop my career
Real rap is like chemical crack
What does not die that'll eternally thrives the free minds
That's who you know you're alive
I was spiritual first
She cut my umbilical at the physical birth
And welcomed me to miserable Earth
She laid me on my back under the dirt
Cover my girth with a dirty shirt
I passed out emotionally bankrupt
In the dead vegetation it was dark brown red like menstruation
I couldn't eat it despite the temptation
I was hungry and impatient
They botched my face in operation
At night from a satellite view the city's a heart
The red and white blood cells are the lights on cars
From that distance look down and observe my lyrics
The atmospheres of organism we apparently living
Law One through Forty Eight
Law Forty Nine is the loophole I use to escape
2012 is the bill due date
It won't be much longer now
Maybe I should be for my 400 bar song
Without balance I am bound to fall
To chemicals are color coded
I highly encourage you not to smoke it
Brain cells glow with a light dose
And I dare you to tell me to not spit
Beyond that whatever life is left we gotta live it till the end
It's very difficult to know if...
They are the masterminds
I just came back from shogun hill
Shoot you in the back of the head with some paint balls
Completely bite off the burglar's hands
Send the clergy emissary to the cemetery
The fourth clone could battle him after he battles me
But your the fifth clone can only be used to tattle me
This is called microphone savagery
I was known as the master of the beat
We were tortured by the palm trees in the Palm Sunday breeze
I see through your feces like telekinesis
Zero degree Celsius liquid will freeze
What he actually gave me was the moment of clarity
Philosophical speak about the God and men mystery
I'm Elijah Muhammad that'll sell chronic
Inside my mind is bad weather
So when I brainstorm it'll rain strong
To Hurricane's swarm in a form of paragraph
Start from the corner of the pages in my pad
But I don't brainwash my listeners
What I have is like Lightening in a bottle
Like Picasso but it's a novel
My black wings are The Lord of the Rings
Swallowed your flesh to his metal intestine
Somewhere in a giant stone King where the interest is big enough
To accommodate a Pterodactyl in flight
Priest sit and the Tabernacle will write
While Jackals fight over the poison Emperor's body
After the disaster I will die from laughter
I pray about peace for you
The keys of Solomon will open the door to that bottomless prison
And let the Leviathan army in
If I'm caught they'll award the post human purple heart
Once a upon a midnight dreary
Being blackballed by the music industry prepared me
I was never paid or given a wealth
I followed my azimuth then transit on a path from apprentice to master
My testimony any place at the top is lonely
When they tried to play me out as a man
I promised the Lord I will not tour any longer
Feast your eyes on the awesome mechanics of the metallic saucers
But you threw away the jewels I gave you
When you're ready to move to the mouth it'll be too late too
That's why I pray for you
Throw away everything you bought
And kneel before the Ark
Any artist will become lethargic from weed smoke
Overspecialization doesn't require special explanation
The information is my interpretation
I sit down at the table and make it
So is nature when surrounded by the unnatural
Walk through the doors of Langley Headquarters
My logo is in the floor etched in marble
One of three peaks of Mount Hermon there in my lifetime
The rhymes is 3 point 1 4 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 8 9
My wife and child were both killed in a helicopter crash
I tried to sit up but can't get up
Hydroxide radicals I couldn't believe it
I was the Anemic Heathen that was saved by the blood of Jesus
My only grievance is I never be the same again
I hope you enjoy it even if you never bought it
I prefer to call it conservative words of wisdom
Mixed with perverted visions
0330 central news network
I filled out visitors of paper work till my head hurt
G words bees and birds can't help but to be perverse
About anything over 30 in a skirts
She suggested I lock the door so we could both get undressed
She reminds me of this ho I used to bang on a Pakistani Sushi boat
Picked up the trail in the parking garage
I pretended I was an intern
She placed the palm firmly on my chest
And I seek to have sex with the Dragon Princess
I couldn't believe the nerve of this
Circus Witch with burger itch
You tried to curse me with a kiss
She will remain my prisoner
But our hormones start raging as soon as I undress her
Started to speak in discrete descriptive speech
A young Black man obsessed with her egg shell white
But when I talk to strippers I'm simple
Try to imagine what she's been through
That's the type of ass that could tear pants
It was the perfect time to take off her clothes
The tale of the Princess and the P and MC
In my dream I wrote a name across The White House wall
So much so I let the whole world know
In the dream she and I share pound cake and tea
In between her shifts on the silver screen
At lyrics the whole industry silently enjoyed
With lyrics the whole industry silently enjoyed
I was taught my heart was my brain in my past life
There's only one way to fight
In the end the only thing we can agree on is death
I beg you to get it together
To truly be clever you gotta be able to think ahead and remember
Turned a blind eye to the energy that made us
The rhymes are relevant day after my development
The potato gets off his couch to wait
The event you can't prevent no matter how much you spend
There's no excuse cause nobody will ever know the truth
Shot her in the head while she slept
If you're loyal I'll murder for you
You disloyal I'll destroy you
At lyrics the whole industry silently enjoyed
The only time I feel free is when I'm rhyming in the booth
The Lion on the loose is not a reckless recluse
But really a dictator with his neck in a noose
That enjoyed the dark matter in the void before time
They let the serpent in but it never occurred to them
They deity regards emcees like me
On planet Earth I design mankind's rebirth
A marvel of water and rock salt from a verse
Not the original but man's imitation of it
Never write the wrong sentence
If I ever said it I meant it
Bend it through telepathic suggestion
Occurred intermittently over protracted periods
Air combat maneuvers without no computer
My ribcage look like miniature shim blades
When I bathe in the waters below
An isolated regime that works twice the pace of your team
These Jedi Mind Tricks are no dream
The entrance to the cave is guarded by a statue of Saint Germain
Holding an oil lamp with a purple flame
The light brightens more and more
Your muscles tight and sore
You fall to waist height then crawl as you are forced to recite bars
But they are not allowed to speak to me that easily
The reason you won't think is the reason I won't rap
Nobody understand it when my spit is mismanaged
I bust through like Sputnik 2
But it take more than that to move me
They manifest beads of sweat
Examine the blood trail
I smell like gun shells
Fourth generation roper report
Everything I was taught bore a resemblance to my thoughts
The truth in the design of the Guggenheim rhyme
I don't miss when I twist the 5.56
Stand there with arms folded
Firearms make me look large and bloated
Then J Wells came through
I support a secure change of custody
Imam death squad rush the building
From the front line with Prince William
Prohibit the media from filming
My Armenian friend tried to pay me in Yen
I'll explain to you what I did
My Saratoga Suit got a customized grip
With a bat wing released from both wrist and both feet
The Rift Valley Fever symptoms could last for weeks
Could elaborate further but suffice to say
Beta test the data with blue lasers
And there is variation in the analogy of where these things have come from
They were created by these giants
They were created by watcher themselves
This is the fire breather
Then negotiate disarmament from the other side of the fence
I create Hip Hop but don't need it
I turn my back on rap like God turned his back on Eden
To return like Cat Stevens
Made it hard to love it
So I come back to conquer with a monster mantra
My spiritual father is Swami Vivekananda
The departed Hip Hop artist regarding the condition of the carnage
Dead farmers I already saw it
We both believe we're fighting Satan
Fine picks and trowels are real I was holding a weapon
About what happened last mission
A small cavernous passage darker than the Catacombs of Paris
I don't use chains to trap a bitch
Over and over until it's automatic
The recluse clearly produced
The abstract schematic you can use over a freshly squeezed glass of pear juice
Right side paralyzed above the waist
Through the deserted desolate space of this purgative place
Dimension of the Earth in nautical miles
These are the Secrets of the Cosmonauts
This is the most important rhyme I ever said in my life
I believe the Cosmonauts will come down and save us
By no means am I to interpret the absolute
I'm merely a vessel that the entity chooses to use
I believe in the power that spins the Earth around upward and outward
Whether or not you like the lyrics I would not be surprised
If you the devil in disguise I can see it in your eyes
Your sexual orientation is none of my business
But if you look at the whole world we represent the human species
You can't ignore continents while they starve
As the Globe becomes more warm
The prophecies are forewarned
You would've thought Katrina storm taught y'all
I've come to learn that the Cosmonauts up high
Don't believe that we deserve another chance and I'll tell you why
The patience of the Gods have run thin
The procession will wash away
The world's sins with Tsunami's and Whirlwinds
The next civilization will dig our artifacts out of a crater
They will say that we were great but that they are greater
Humankind will continue to search for his creator
Wage war against the forces that try to enslave us
I believe the Cosmonauts will come down and save us
If humankind will accept all races
There's no reason that the Cosmonauts wouldn't save us
History is a weapon being used against us
Humanity has been abused before but few remember
Humankind is now on the brink of extinction
Confusing the most yet I find it remedial
Technology is a blessing but it's also a weapon
Teaching us how to hate but does it in a way that we love it
Consumers act like they're afraid of intelligent speech
The rhymes are imagined in theory
Then itemized into a query
It takes more than your ears to hear me
Elevate to a level where your judgment isn't impaired daily
Before the New World Order right around the corner
I'd rather be a pacifist with a full clip
Mankind is now on the brink of extinction
Lost wisdom from the lost kingdom
They some how transmit into your brain a hard idea
You've broken our laws on this planet
This is the reason why
Very soon when the sky became dark
Thousands and thousands of people will die
I even got a spit box for those lonely days
Turned the highway into a tomb
Got stuck through a wench around a red wood tree
A 1000 feet above sea level
Can't let the circumstance stop me
Dry weather gear for the desert breeze
Toast bread and fry eggs on the roof of my Jeep
Take my boots off I won't even look at my feet
When the time comes I do it again
No more technology privilege
You better pick up that weapon and pass it to the right
Laugh if you like but the time is near
I observe purgatory from the solar observatory
To late to call upon Jesus Christ now
Collect your weapon and ammo
Your family got dragged off
Put to work as slaves in a hell pit because you were selfish
Face it your heart's full of hatred
The vocalist with osmosis spit
950 more bars just to talk to the kid
The mirror image of the emperor's lyrics
Concubines are forbidden to compare it until I finish
The magnetic patient will record the same thing
Ostriches are not supposed to fly
Fighter pilots with not eyelids
The evil bald Eagle strike you again
As Earth travels through the gravity belt
And I can offer you no help
Beef with me equals dead thugs
One thing I can't stand in this rap game is a bitch ass who suck dick
And they said I'd never make it with a help from you know who
But I proved them wrong
Even without money in my pocket I still move along
You know I'm known to shut them down
Maybe we in modern uh civilization haven't really connected with this
This is never been done before with a rhyme outside the realm of time
It's the first of its kind
I procured a small piece of the treasure
33 is the number that enlightens the Brother
Insight to the fullest that could brighten the dullest
I drive forward Sandstorms make my eyes water
Skull is a submarine hull
With surface permutation of the permafrost
We thought close support from the Navy Carriers and Air Force
1000 Bars it will probably always be
You cannot contend with this when I let it rip
Through the spine induce the rhyme
Internal fire produces the high
From the streets of New Jersey to Germany
To jungles in Angola where most the meat poachers heard of me
I guess it wasn't meant to be
Reload the graphics notice I spit it rapid
Victory over injury a victim to misery
The myriad of my metaphors make me a mystical mystery
But I don't know what it means
They say it's more than a dream
What ought to crawl has learned to walk
I have mastered The Art of Rhyming now I am so bored
Your name will be added to the Black List Registry
Observe the man with the microphone strand
I look up in the sky to see if God is judging me
The Genie gave me three more because I listen well
Before one can know the world so I showed myself
But on the other hand these rappers are worthless
Poet Laureate is reserved for the name G
My lyricism amplifies every letter written
Lyrical Fitness is no secret of course
Preserve the sanctity of the Soldiers in IRAQ
I gotta spit till the story is told
Furniture moves when I walk into a room
I'm Big Billy Bob Black Angus
From the gutter to the gallows no media coverage
All cultures come from One Mind
Metaphor and Rhyme is poetry by design
You lied to us all in your speech
Parasites attach to feed fulfilling antiquated needs
Over The Horizon Radar Rhymes
Patent number 4686605
I've apologized but I can't change who I am
If A is a success in life
Then A must equal X plus Y plus Z no doubt
If work equals X and play equals Y
From the Kinetic to the Energetic
The grown up who showed up drunk with his own cup stoned as fuck
Gotta find a way to generate doe
The minerals where they grow determine the stability of the flow
I might get drunk and boast
Williams you gotta go first
Nobody applauded the atmosphere was ominous
I need more pain so I can pretend to be tough
Just in case Humans ever get to World War VIII
Arctic Geography is conducive to Astronomy
A good Psychological environment for science
I'm memorizing and visualizing peace and quiet
Comparative image sharpness between artists
I don't think you know what you're about to get involved in
This is my unacknowledged special access project
Time reversed waves in nonlinear optics
The lyrical inimical is miserable because I've built a citadel
Of syllables that made me invincible
Creatively I have never been to this level
Plasma Ray Gun is just one explanation
Any and All entry points have immigration
I didn't know the spy that sold me out would be my own cousin
Washington didn't say it quite that way
Pulsating Lights and Sounds surrounds spirits
The Electrical Optical Coupling Gear is effective
I've almost perfected this
I'm one word away from excellence
You can't Emcee take a seat
You better be filming this
You can mix this song a thousand ways I don't doubt it
The Visionary Cell designed my new Lab
You must've been kicked the fuck out of school
You cannot fold under the political pressure
You gotta take prudent and precautionary measures
Four and a half foot beings with big black eyes
You'll never reach the end of it
They left me dehydrated by the Nile River naked but I made it
With passion of a Microphone Patriot
I did it for the world to discover
I hope the words reach you
Into the bottomless pool of Poetry I plunge
1000 Bars from the real Iron Lungs
Minister of Information
Splice microphones with unknown chromosomes
To discover the codes that controls the brain's frontal lobes
Few of us will be alive by Solar Cycle 25
They won't be satisfied till every one of us die
The only way that you can free yourself is your mind
First thing you gotta do is put the antagonism behind
Then you gotta put ya life on the line
NO I will not forsake you for a paycheck
They monitor my body functions from central London
A robot arm shoves the drugs in
Says she wouldn't fuck me if I was her husband
Don't trust the bitch
I'm in a warehouse alone
Wouldn't matter anyway I'm in a paranormal zone
So I can learn to fly
So go find somebody else to dick ride
The Inconvenient Truth is a convenient 2-0-1-2
It's only logical its time for the truth
Whether I'm gonna be around to witness it or not
Cause you can't blackball the light
They know my hands always been tied
There's some things in this world that money can't buy
The media can not be trusted
You don't have to suck dick just to get your shot
Just work with what you got
50 plus bars is some new shit
50 plus bars is some new shit
Take it back to 1997 exclusive clue shit
I've been dealing with hate since 1998
None of y'all can stop the onslaught of those bars
Rainfall and fireballs fell from the stars
Whoever ignored lyrical law
Hip Hop didn't understand it at all
They couldn't manage my thoughts
So I retreated to the land of the lost
Don't talk about beats talk about bars
Give a fuck if I sell one unit
I've already proved it
Now I must prepare for my posthumous interview with the vampire Druids
That are coming to relieve me of my fluids
Obviously the government lied to me
I will always pay the ultimate price
Whether I am wrong or whether I am right
I eat emcees on behalf of Iron Mike
I denounce fear like Steven Greer and his wife
The subject matter sound barely connected
Even when it's understood it's rarely respected
The evidence is staring directly at the detective
Alex Jones left me a message saying I won't be accepted
NOW who's the skeptic
They fucked up Hip Hop's progression
My spirit feels like it's in a prison
I speak on the music conspiracy but nobody wanna listen
I talked about this shit years ago
I told my family if they kill us don't be scared to go
Hang you from your nose on a square pole
And a two headed parrot with a desert fatigue beak
Decorate my bitch breasts with bells
The arthropod tentacles controlled by mental vegetables
Spectacles of doom and gloom and sonic booms
Republicans ride brooms around nuclear mushrooms
You are safe from the nuclear fallout
Now you will crawl out into the hands of a monster now
The best emcee turned his launch codes over to me
On my command you will turn the key and we'll see
The maze in those caves are infinite
The aftermath aftershock is a disaster in a box
The satellite showed me your position
The text is a sick rep for Rippers
The leaders have discovered we the sickest and they wanna sit with us
Revolution Ripper movement you can't stop it
I write what some would call marathon songs
The music industry tried to banish long bars
Every week I slaughter seven beats
My title can't be touched nowhere on the street
I hear a lot of emcees speak
Heads up display with a ticker and a pitcher and picture of the Ripper
Neurotransmitters hooked up to his central nervous system
It feeds him the purpose and the vision
Jailbreak but not out of prison
Strapped to a suicide written
Inside my own mind scripting altruistic composition
Anoint them both with Tesla coils if they quoin my rhymes
A very good screen writing skill
My higher self is outside the realm where time is felt
Vainglorious warriors with deep space euphoria
The pedagogy tried to call me a communist
The icosahedron is a prison for a three headed demon
Knowledge is needed to argue with the followers of Jesus
I saw Gandhi weakening from not eating
I saw police brutality beatings
I saw the leaders getting into spaceships and leaving
I tried to search for possible meanings but I couldn't see the logical reasoning
Bovine mammals hooked up to intravenous vaccination panels
Collecting contaminated skin samples
You are completely culpable for everything you're supposed to do
Even if it's not known to you
The weight of the language I spoke to you
The weight of the letters and the words in the rhymes that I wrote for you
I spit like a supernatural computer
Hold me down Professor Griff
Minds that produce minds that produce minds like mines
Now everyone want to talk about conspiracy
You should of took Channel Zero more seriously
Professor Griff taught me how to spit it lyrically
Now I'm part of the Ministry
Most of the best emcees disrespected me
I should have slammed the door in his face
You sit around your tables and say grace
Beef in Hip Hop is just aimless entertainment
Now ain't that the goddamn truth
No matter what Hip Hop always lose
After plasma transfusion I became Rasputin
The master of translucence who lives in a green house
Before Lucifer sent me back to the future to smash computers
Assassinate classes of students
I spare those who show classic improvement
I found out the same time as you
You know what happens when you come from dishonest roots
We know freedom is based off the money
When nobody can touch your lunch meat
Their vaccines give you eczema of the penis
Post Traumatic War Lab Stress
On every last base camp in your wasteland
I scheme for weeks and draft designs
On how to craft my rhymes like a mastermind
I'll cut the tongue out of my son just to stay number one
Who'll never be better than what they stole the genetics from
Which alleviates your teenage angst and break cages
Hit you with a meat log bigger than a tree trunk
I kick the shit that make you pee all on your jeans chump
You cannot begin to comprehend
If you cross me the position you'll all be in
But I don't lose none of my big pro fights
I just bruise dudes twice my size and crews move
I clear the room with a sonic boom and nuclear plume
I'm bring doom to musicians with a feminine groom
So go ahead you'll have hell of a time
The ninja rap star just explodes on the scene
It could get ugly if they don't intervene
I'm incoherent or so it would seem
Cause its apparent if you took half of what passes for lyrics
You are now in the presence of a master musician
I craft my rap with the precision of a mathematician
Motivated by the golden age of rap back in the older days
The shit I said in a rhyme considered a federal crime
Anyone with a shred of intelligence could tell it's just ahead of its time
To entrusted military titles to Joan of Ark
To Napoleon Bonaparte down to Rosa Parks
In public drunk in the trunk of your whip
I'm more dangerous in the streets than a toxic spill
Yo this is fifty bars of sickness
Consider it a Christmas gift to you
You're an emcee and you mention my name
Shit like that supposed to be private
I'll sell you four million records then I'll tell you go to hell
And make the group wish Bizarre shot pool in a bar
I really do hope you know who get involved
I'm a tyrant that'll snatch my respect and scram
I hate when dudes treat this like life a movie
To stick this blade into your fade in front of spectators
You the devil in a red dress on MTV
You sign more black people than a basketball team
Consciously you know I rock you to sleep
The only black man you respect is 50
And the greatest of all time was dead right
You never even saw her nude and you busted two
It must excite you seeing black people being tribal
That's why Dr. Dre signed you
I bet you right now you got a big rotten Rosenberg beside you
I know what you thinking... kill that boy
No more target practice on retarded actors
Whatever happens to me in this game
I've always got my ear to the street
I've been better than you before Genesis was made
I penetrate through Hailey's Comet with metal blades
Fraternity of the Impoverished
Because of all the hardships that I've been through
Symbolic Hip Hop prophet speak to your subconscious
Fringe politics got the public thinking the opposite
Drilling holes through the Faraday cages of your brains
Then I implant the arcane image of Saint Germaine
High lyrical exponent intelligence quotient
When I'm focused I can engage multiple opponents
Verbose with emotions of psychosis
A real emcee don't have to do what he don't wanna do
I'd rather die by living brave then live like a slave
I'd rather be broke then be fake and get paid
These layers of physicality challenge me
My soul is gold and it's the only thing that's able to balance me
My energy body has a alchemical copy that looks godly
The national debt says the US is a vagina
Of a black widow spider spraying blood out like a geyser
The potential of life versus the potential of death
Either way you go through mad mental stress
We ignored the gems now we gotta do it all again
We failed Hip Hop's laws and brought down shame upon our cause
Now we will fall upon our swords
The Shaman pays homage to Solomon
Every now and then I get retarded and spit
I would like to apologize to every artist I dissed
Everybody assumes that I wanna rhyme when I don't
Sometimes I just wanna chill and watch you flow
Ripped out the vocal cords of the people
I walk up to your bed side in disguise with red eyes
And tell you to remember these rhymes
Engineer directly out of Full Sail
Spitting and grabbing facts and data to enhance ya
I still ain't understanding this shit
Who the fuck is you to criticize a lyrical king
I ain't heard nothing about it
I had to give you three years to recognize
The Internet is an early telepathic building set
My lyrics are international nuclear missile threats
But children don't understand the concept of consequence
But no I will not accept what the media says
They are the reason we are being mislead
I make up my own fucking mind
There are more of us than them
But at the same time they are gods and we are just mortal men
They are gods and we are just mortal men
I cannot imagine their power
They put a black family in the White House just so they can take away ours
Mommas and babies is crying
You can laugh at my appearance
But that don't mean I'm selfish
Soft but hard on the outside like shellfish
You won't do a motherfucking thing
The world was never ready for me
That's where the biggest demon is
But at least I got better beats now
I'd apologize but you acting like a real fag
Twelve years later I still don't get acknowledged for shit that I write
But I don't want to talk to you now
It'd be a motherfucking miracle if you even see me walking around
You a cyborg unit with no soul to it
Blood sacrifice or not
Do you think that the powers that be
You need to come up with a better plan
The Devil smash metal weapons like glass
We have to stay on a spiritual path
Media shows up to capture the buzz
I'm a child of God not a rapper from the gutter
I'm six of one and half a dozen of the other
But can't nullify the high science that is coming from the rhymes
I couldn't believe it the day that I was told
That every person alive does not have a soul
That'll overload the senses in your nose
Young folk can't even afford to get old
Write and produce and record and you love it
And say rude things to judge it
Handcuffed and take mug shots of it
I told you before I'm nobodies spit puppet
This is a social experiment put on by the public
Hip Hop is completely corrupted
Hip Hop's the way it is because of you cousin
My lyrics too advanced for the average block hustler
Recycle the fire and deep fry it
My shit is timeless like the Great Wall of China
Sick in the biggest way like a dinosaur virus
We don't care what you're fans think
The observer changes the properties of the observed
I know what this entire ordeal can expand to
I'm a big fan of everything you do
This was always my purpose
They told me I'm few and far between like oasis to the wilderness
I'm still a mess but I climb it like a duplex
Barely get hellos in the morning but we wrestling
AM to the PM I'm preparing for the execution
I got the tent up in my hood with the chicken and the tater salad
Listen and you'll make it past this
Rapid fire comes the path to ghetto life
You're a fish in a school of whales
He changed it to Rip so that he could rap
There were those who observed to memorize what they heard
They enjoyed the rhymes and the sounds of the words
Such glorious poetry interwoven into code
Rip had written something that would never grow old
On the night of the Ripper's Eve
Little boys and girls would sit with crossed knees and begin to read
Their short size is only a disguise
Sipping hot cocoa slow in the middle of the snow
I wrote my first doctorate in confinement
Between the choices I have made and choices made for me
Reminds me of a story I should tell you in the morning
I moistened my fingers and turned the page
I'm amazed you never have to be told to behave
You raise your hand to speak and respond to your name
I remember... the day I had changed
The way I was struck by lightening in the rain
Maybe some other time I'll tell you what I became
I can tell you that I've waned in the pain of my shame
It is written in books and carved into skin
Spit rhymes while I shimmy up the cliff side
The questions give me more insight into your mind
Verses be so strong they are generally interpreted wrong
Prone to correspond their responses from the songs
I'm smarter then those fifth graders are
Ideas eliminated in the order they were created
To the cold corpse cellophane wrapped on the floor
I shot darts and stomp on your brain in Doc Martins
Till everything you see is Siamese
Name a name he'll be history
Whoever leap next from a speed jet without a parachute
Turn you into carrot soup troop
How can I create the right sentence to help explain
Put you up against War Machine
You pole vault into a wall of defeat
The only thing that matter to you is if you had your pistol full
We watch our children look at us with empty wishes
Blood flows down heaven's gates as we await our torturous fates
But only those with knowledge seem to see it biblically
This teach men before they descend
Y'all cats are halfway out the closet like Mario Lopez
My infallible flow is sicker than subliminal phallic symbols
Of Walt Disney motion picture posters
Your amateur flow is not compatible to my notes its
My passion for what I write is like a massive appetite
His upper torso is bigger than yours
My pituitary gland is on crack
That's why they barely understand where I'm at
The most controversial artist in rap
Unless I rehearse it again and again
Rotating floating spheres like clockwork rotating gears
Remember the last time you got burned
But do it live if you think you can handle this
Tranquility to infinity
Coming to damage you spitting understandable slang at you
I'm the all seeing lyrical with infinite bars and visuals
And the sideways eight peripheral
I told you I spit a rhyme that'll melt the Earth
Then ask you in the afterlife if you felt the verse
On Planet Earth I search for my Tranquility first
When I erupt you duck or eggs clash flash solar blast from Bus
Then sweep you off the stage like crumbs
I spit about them lyrics my people can't live without
A thousand bars later I ain't heard nothing from Pap
On stage with a him at the Palladium
And as soon as the beat stop I forget how to speak
I release a better rhyme seven times a week
To beat me you gotta be better than my last release
Till every rhyme you memorize is gone
Battle you for the respect in a battle to the death
Before the Federal Communication Commission started a new division
With the intention to cripple our children
Mentally deficient from television
This radio programmer we listen to got to many elements missing
Deceived by a system that's media driven
I let the rhythm hit them with a chemical algorithm
Liable to kill them if I ever get with them I rip them
Tuck the heat before I brush the teeth
The athlete at the track meet with rusty cleats
Artillery like lawn mowers with four motors and four rotors
Look like a mom with four strollers
The war drums sound like a hundred guns fired at once
Involuntary muscle spasm assassin busts with a passion
Poor rappers fall victim to the metaphor master
Drill your ass raw for ice core data
An earthquake machine being powered by a crystal
In the Elohim Lord Lizard King with the Ripper conditioning
Partitioning with the Fischer King eating chicken wings
My fingertips are glistening but I'm listening
To fail to capture the meaning attached to the words
Killer Ripper spits to the sustained pitch mixed and chopped
Stuff tubas with gunpowders to improvise bazookas
Colder than killer cobras over Jehovah
Delta soldiers in blimp balloon gondolas with stealth motors
But I can only take both of us so you better soldier up
Crazy as crystal communicate correct signal
Call the Commissioner I'm going to crucify the Christian Caligula
I kick your door down in loafers
A midget with dreadlocks down to his toes
I don't give a fuck what they wanna say.
Watching the game being played out through my eyes.
This is the soundtrack that we will train to.
This is not a call to arms
These are called keep alert bars.
That's a personal flaw.
Murdered bar after bar since 1974
But I am punished for the tone of my skin.
Bring it down about 14.5 DB
Maybe then you might see what I mean.
Bring it down about 14.5 DB
Maybe then you might see what I mean.
But I am punished for the tone of my skin.
Can't remember who I was.
A constitution written in collusion
And tell me the direction that the fuel tank is headed
Scram jet packs straps attached to my back
Rocket exhaust melt skin off like wet wax
Fog covers the launch pad
I won't need to travel beyond that
It can be seen in time zones eight hours apart by NORAD
Bow waves are made when I sweep my arms back
To fast track to the lunar surface's dark patch
Inside onyx black alien artifacts
Well guarded in the event of a chartered attack
The outpost is nothing more than a trap
Deimos is the most underrated of the pack
A solar max melts polar caps
I notice that think tanks with closed minds miss unknown facts
With actionable impulse to act when I can't relax
I work hard but play harder in fact
I sit back and listen to jazz and smoke hash in a mineral bath
I concentrate on eight frequency rates
The body begins to numb as the spirit elevates
Closed circuit surveillance showed me a face
He responded with a strong handshake
With ambient music in the background
Rap is deeply rooted in the music generation
I swear the Great Bear entered the Dragon's Lair
I was there in the center of St. Petersburg Square
Took a picture of the body and a burner
I said you better bring an army
Lets see if you can follow this rhyme
Follow this rhyme with your mind
With no animation or green screen
Human beings need special specs provided by special request
To see the spectacular special effects
If you can see what I saw or hear what I heard
Your ears will not need to hear the sound of my words
My thoughts follow my feelings that is how I think
What is the point of thought if you can not control the result
We were intelligently designed to be a resource
We pursue an illusion that isn't real
Than predicting a coin toss a hundred times to prove skill
That's why I can rhyme with consistence
Indisputable evidence repeatable on the street or in studio session
I am sorry if you feel I am refusing your questions
At these levels I have much higher attention
My intent to present the most intensive lung splitting
Tongue twisting sentence ever historically recorded to present
But that is not the point of this lesson
Back to the beginning when the Milky Way first started spinning
Sound was the only thing living
Life began to emerge from one light blinking
The sound stabilized it
The color spectrum was immediately divided by levels of brightness
The speed of the spin began rising
Gravity was created and forever affected by this
Smashing against one another like balls on a pool table
We like to label so we give things names
I shook your hand and told you mine was Germaine
When it was exactly that
Not specifically jams in the park
But when emcees used to talk with advanced thought
Forced to start from scratch to rhyme from the heart when I rap
Looking forward to not looking back
Rip the Jacker bout to get at you
Then I will diagnose with tinnitus
The cuneiform symbols on my uniform tell you what I been through
Heat it up till the bones blacken
Full Metal Gold Plaque classics
Your chronograph is still in the past tense
Double shot glass of absinthe still spitting fantastic
Before it turn into something somebody gotta bleed about
White phosphorus smoke screen the whole street out
I'm in a meeting with the Surgeon General of written texts
The battery of one thousand psychological tests
I am exhausted and stressed but I continue to press
Spell words wrong while writing down rhymes nowadays
Took me back to 1998 at Universal
You know I'm still nice with the verbals and I ain't even heard you
Got Ground Zero asthma cancer
Buried on the Moon as the top Hip Hop Commander
Something that I understood naturally
According to Title 17 USC
I'm a Reggae turned rap translator from Jamaica
Everything you heard before with more layers
The audio will blend into multiples of ten
The lies we have been told really are the truth
So together we will all learn again what we knew
The carousel issue continues to revolve unresolved
Take my hand Ripper Grand Wizard chain of command
A menace to music that's mastered every style that I spit.
These poems open door for the chosen.
They say we owe them but everything that we own has been stolen.
But God don't need guns or bombs.
Positive effects what come out of our common respect.
Sales of street polymer gels that form hardened shells that repel
Interrogative drills in the torture cell
Cutting me up with glitter covered gloves
They ask questions with Russian like aggression
Space grunts line up face front
We low crawl paying no attention to our nose at all
I see the beast pupil size increase
Zero in where the chest and the neck intersect
Cardboard papers signs
I mount my weapon like I mount my women
I like it let's meet next week
Nobody here really knows...
A poor pauper's offering for the alter
I see a revolution in the industry
I see the partition of God's religion
Become united by our bars and our common visions
The Golden Era of Rap will always be apart of me
The future talks to me because the present is ignoring me
But all you can see is holographic artistry
Creativity is less than average
Rip the Jacker shows you the future in fragments
Through madness my view is expanded
To help balance near impossible trances in the labyrinth of the enchanted
Where air quality is unbearably rancid
Concise lyrics strike down from the heavens
A four finger ring with a eyeball in it for vision
For spiritual slave labor in a prison
Beyond time displacement of space and spaceships in oasis
Beyond the reach of human contemplation
A human made it to satisfy unusual cravings
The mystic in a room with crystal walls and floors
That cause warm feeling sensations precipitating from the finger tips
To a gold tongue that spits to the tone of the drum
With the oxygen that flows down the throat to the lungs
And the Clarity of Singularity has begun
I rest alone in a cold cabin composed of stone from old agate
A sarcophagus filled with gold tablets
Excavated the bone matter of this unknown rapper
The blood of the Gorgon was used as the cure for the poison
The poison that destroyed his organs
He spit to precision instrumentals
The target area surface was no wider than a nickel
He piloted the missile from a digital menu
Inside remote headgear he would put on to look into
By mastery of the mental he was able to see
What the past and future civilizations had been through
Acoustic imagery transmitted through the music and energy
When I'm spitting no distance can limit me
The gallery of my art was prefabricated and placed in a Ark
But grave robbers rip the pages apart
The meaning of these rhymes are dead to the modern day mind
Even if you hear this a thousand times
Because of this many have died
The silver cord is a metaphor for the will of the Lord
I was called to climb aboard and explore
That's when I saw the Tree of Life in the yard
External experience reflects what's inside you
There are other ways to win
To me it's just baseball and I'm Babe Ruth
With Rap pattern parameters I set
I said you'll never be the best unless you pass this test
When the form is complete pass it on to Angela Clark
To determine your eligibility and get you insured
Every morning the board panel assembly judges man by his bars
Courage of heart and what he offers the cause
If he's accepted he'll be sworn in tomorrow
If he's rejected he's recycled and retested on stage at the Apollo
They are nothing without you but you will be nothing without the truth
But we are blind because Good and Evil is the same thing
Do not be confused by the choice of words used
But you still have to choose and choosing not to choose is still a choice
Sometimes silence is a powerful voice
The body is of no use if the mind is enslaved
But theses slaves can not bind your light or your sound waves
The final test is presented when we least expect
They want revenge against us because we fight for our freedoms
But we are blind because Good and Evil is the same thing
But we are blind because Good and Evil is the same thing
I look towards the sky for the answers to why
I analyze the great divide and saw God on both sides
The Earth belongs to every living thing that walks upon it
But just the patient fuck the subject of Satan
Believe what you perceive
You ain't ready for the shit that I got
And knowing people can still be lonely
I just go to sleep because when I wake up I am not an emcee
I get back on the clock when I hear the next beat
But we are blind because Good and Evil is the same thing
He is the Sea Merchant who eats Sea Urchins and Sea Serpents
Deep Sea searches bring his verses back up to the surface
Someone is brought in to interpret
Do not engage in conjectural with the professor
Nothing above ground will escape
Only the best deserve to be the center of attention
And Laser Weapons are now being tested
Inside this bubble composed of two poles
Who's good at producing a few poems
There is not much time to decide or take sides
You are standing in the middle of lyrical fratricide
Giant tiger mosquitoes and carrion beetles biting people
The Mist makes it hard to see through
It has always been believed by those even wiser than me
That nobody can describe what I see
Reality hangs in the balance
A string of islands that connect like strings on a violin
Waking up to a dark horizon
My rap style will always be in its prime
This is a new season with new rhymes for the same reason
The public needs it but without faith they won't believe it
It's connected to our spiritual ascension
Obey the law with its fundamentally flawed components
Forced to start from scratch to rhyme from the heart when I rap
Looking forward to not looking back
Rip the Jacker bout to get at you
Then I will diagnose with tinnitus
The cuneiform symbols on my uniform tell you what I been through
Heat it up till the bones blacken
Full Metal Gold Plaque classics
When it was exactly that
Not specifically jams in the park
Directed energy weapon emission downrange
Fry brains that remain in anatomy not changed
Some consider this preliterate gibberish
That very instant they hear this lyricist
He was wrong about the songs that I write
Been faster than that before inside the Hip Hop Rap core
Battled in arenas as Matador
Forced to resign for the force of my rhymes
You still see the flash when I blast
Hyena on the tiger leash biting the beast
The body in the trunk smell rotten from the funk
I won't take it if you offer what I want
Cadavers on the back of the tank drag as they hang
Give me some more slack on this rope
That's why the industry's debunking my lyrics
The Ripper's language won't appeal to the masses because they look past it
Only the masters know the seal of the scarab
Some humans are born average based off environmental circumstances
But do not be embarrassed by your underdeveloped status
It's up to you to find the right questions and ask it
Research leads to results sometimes we find meaning after
Other times they're just meaningless babblers
Take matters into your own hands
Hip Hop is the greatest genre known to man
We can overthrow any plan and control man
You don't wanna wrestle with Armstrong
Damage any motherfucking beat that I rhyme on
Grunting like a pack of wild boars
Power source Lyrical Law my bomb squad full force
Nitrous Oxide Bars pull a bull of course
Pitch fork to you neck just to prove I'm raw
Passing yourself off like a Rap star
I don't fall for deceptions or decoys
I'm a beast and I'm clairvoyant
Double trouble dear promise fuck you and your comments
James Cameron with a gamma ray cannon
... Brainwashed Hip Hop
They live in underground cabins
They spacecraft look like the Eiffel Tower in Paris
They pray on my downfall they orchestrated Hip Hop's imbalance
They underestimated my talent
I hold the globe up like Atlas
They slandered my character through private and public propaganda
Lyrical Law's a classic they can't get past it
Lyrical Law's a classic they can't get past it
The Dragon of Judah breathe fire till his last breath
Full Battle Rattle in action lyrical Metal Jackets
Coming through with several new attachments
Nitrogen lungs yo my tongue mix propane with spit
Crash the Vatican as soon as I land
Scientology guides put my rhymes on photography slides
To quantify the higher knowledge applied
But I'm an uncaged animal channeling Hannibal
A cannibal bite your head off and hand it to you
I throw a hundred miles an hour with a medicine ball
I melt your fortress down to caramel softness
Hit your through the atrium of heavenly light
I've used every word possible to let you know what I can do
Come in the cage you get stomped on the mat
You can rap but you ain't all that
And don't ever mention his name no more
Alienated aliens get ate by alien apes
Like Kill Bill between a hundred gay lovers
The president of Hip Hop with mad motherfuckers on the grassy knoll
I take it back to my Curriculum days
I don't want them childish problems
Lyrical manslaughter charges interfere with my Lyrical Law process
We hunt down Hip Hop monsters
And drive them all the way to Wisconsin
Get it over with you can never fuck with my style
You can spit your stupid punchlines all you want
But after this the whole world gonna see who won
Every time this year we appear in the square
The story of glory brought me to tears
With bucked teeth bust your guns or get rushed in the streets
To a dark room to witness your doom
Bash you in the face with the mag
Twenty four apprentices for hardcore fellowship
If you endure your mind's open doors
Complete the last step without crossing my rep
With combined payloads my glide bombs provide flows
That cause World War II death tolls at live shows
Independently targeted
Bombing shit from so high up in the atmosphere you lose consciousness
Intravenously cold blooded cooling coils are running through my jaws
We crucify you on a cross for a quarter
I'll erase your verse off the track so fast you'll wake up tired
Untouchable since the day I came out
How you like me in the future when I'm wearing that crown
You act like Hip Hop is all you listen to
Why get on the track if you can't stand next to me
So much energy it's a felony
Last night we wiped white stuff on her butt
You don't have to be scared of no strap
Fall back or no more contact with the gods of Rap
You can't add all the rhymes you had
Your mouth is a wound and your tongue is a scab
This is a concept the young mind doesn't grasp
That old stick in the mud will put a gold bullet in the gun
Show you where red blood comes from
No matter the lies that claim otherwise
This is Lyrical Law. not lyrical war
That's called Lyrical Law boss
I stare because doubt is there
They in love with something they can't stomach
Underneath the tunnels that are hidden in the tundras
Round Table knights with night vision
Appear in the clouds as eyes looking down
Density light as a feather expand and contract
Lyrical Law is tribunal communal court
At the same time till the people's minds are distraught
Everybody's surprised that you made it this far
Tens of thousands of songs the catalog just goes on
I'll give you one clue to guess what my rap gun do
And when I'm done a paraplegic will outrun you
Y'all know what happens when I rapper starts yapping
I be bionic orangutan hand back stabbing
I break light speed surge and illustrate verbs
See I'm admitting ya sentence was well written
Except this motherfucker should have never started spitting
I'm too trifling to let him life again
See some of the worst speakers that I know
Boy you got a lot of balls
If you come in my zone dissing my curriculum
This is the definitive guide on beats and rhymes
Or how to get a black eye fucking with those black guys
You better listen to what I'm saying and teach yourself
Or I'll give you a belt and watch you beat yourself
Told you don't make a sound if you do they will put you down
Hip Hop is not based off risk on a primal level
You better understand this shit or get talk to an Arabic banana clip
In your house through your window boy
With some Mexican dude and some gunslingers too
Evacuate every bitch that make love so good
I don't have to rip the face off no fool
So we barricade the doors and wait for the noise
A boy should not talk with a psychotic voice
Go take your place next to any emcee that's great
I murder a sixteen to the point that it's embarrassing
Shatter your heart's main vein pipe
Insane at night I might have your career disappear in plain sight
I'm bloodying punchlines like I assaulted a hundred zebras
Became a famous behemoth misbehaving angel
I'm bringing so much beef it'll make a Hindu kneel
The best thing you'll ever write is a suicide note
Keep to myself strategic for stealth
Tear the target to pieces reload and repeat it
I got a billion bars but I ain't got the time to release it
And you ain't got the time to listen to it
Shut down your studio sessions DNA analysis and collections
Wicked and wretched send you a message blow your ass out to the desert
Motherfucker's prepare for the unexpected
Any MC gets weak when he knows he's dead meat
If I strike you'll be red for weeks
You might check in with a beast that'll tan you like the Mexican heat
The steps to my monastery are steep
It can't get no hyper than this
Lyrical Law hands on jet turbo fans on
You bail out like Amelia Earhart
SEER training is for naught
Hip Hop is barely exposed to the emotion of hate
My label shot me in the back as I was climbing the gate
I was a teenager when Hip Hop saved the day
So even when you thought the message was negative it promoted positive health
It was about the rhymes not wealth
It was about our culture not what the culture could sell
We amused ourselves and this confused everybody else
I used to wanna smell the pale Roxanne's tale
Biz Mark's big ass gold chain
One day I think I saw the Jungle Brothers dancing on Soul Train
Memories disappear like Houdini
My friends disappeared faster than my budget when my producer was greedy
Whenever the horns blowing gets deep
Def Jam said I couldn't compete
Probably the first Arab Nazi
Throw your hands in the air if you ready for more
It was time to destroy the place
We've had enough of the lies
We won't keep believing your disguise
Ain't no way to break through
If you keep believing what they tell you
So much stress on your chest you just got to buckle to you knees
Lightening bolts that branch out fangs to the throat
I've been rapping since rap happened
Always broken with their wicked mind.
But you must control how to channel it
4th dimensional shifts are sandwiched
Between this reality and a 5th dimensional rift
The most advanced lyricism ever spit
And all they keep talking about is some stupid random shit
Cause other peoples business will beat yo ass
They bathe in human corpse dismembered to their liking
The leaders acknowledge this and profit
They are the watchers of the prophets
We've had enough of the lies
We won't keep believing your disguise
Ain't no way to break through
If you keep believing what they tell you
So much stress on your chest you just got to buckle to you knees
Steel cables repel downward to inner mountain
There's probably only a thousand left
Lyrical Law is your only outlet
Get out while you still can and forget about it but don't doubt it
My lyrics give me presidential pardon
I serve as the Shepherd and Bro to bring a Message to the Globe
This law is the mortar between stones
I serve as the Shepherd and Bro to bring a Message to the Globe
We are one Soul in separated zones
We control our souls and the microphones
That control the sound waves that this Law exposes
You have proved your valor yet again
Let us hope for the last time
There is always somebody left to fight
I'll melt your squid face with ten thousand stars
Your battle raps dried up like the ass of the Sphinx
And your brains fried up my verses make your ball shrink
I'll kill you like Marie Curie with Ionizing Radiation
You are facing termination by your own creation
My metaphors mechanics will toss you off the planet
I ran back home to battle Rip on the phone
You say we'll live without fear for several millions years
If you hold hands with your peers like a bunch of queers
I leave Rip dehydrated with lines of hot lava
I tie you up with a snake shaped like a sideways eight
And watch you break and suffocate at an unrelenting pace
Mechanical skeletal structure was designed with a Heavy Mental
The Will of Knowledge God controls thoughts and movement
So many layers I can't demonstrate it on paper
My melodic emulators cut you down with trachea lasers
Of deeply deposited argon vapors
My every verse is a psychic institutional burst
I choose which layer to listen to first
But loud and clear my every verse is well heard
They barely understand you
Henry Louis Gates Jr. said I was a lyrical computer
A great leader of a spiritual movement
With more infinite rhymes than cousins
When you take the time to unearth what I did
The mixing board got a thousand channels plugged in
Music generated user generated mixing board entertainment
For you mental entrainment
Celestial arms spiral into viral columns
I was betrayed the moment you were born
And more often than not I say it in my songs
All day long I talk about Lyrical Law
I reserve the right to say whatever I want
If God kisses your face and the Devil kissed your ass
The human population is reduced to ten percent of the half
For those who love to laugh
If you don't understand don't mock me
The midnight lyricist with a one thousand bar cylinders
A Ripper's lyricism is unlimited
The opening mechanism for the Sphinx is behind the ears
But there is freedom behind your fears
I am the autistic King Ellipsis who broke the Ecliptic
But don't nobody wanna listen
Bare witness to my lyrical fitness
Lyrical Law from the heart of the Dark Lizard King still spitting
They got their plans and we got ours
Plus I got my own plans if something goes sour
Blasting and attacking and backtracking through a massive magnet
Vocals powered by zero point magic motors
Created an album that some love but others dismiss
Using some fucked up mixing board spirits
Everything I've written for my brothers and sisters who still listen
Beyond the absence of light is only blackness
Beyond the absence of light is all blackness
Superior rhymes recorded inside ethereal time
I'm in a spaceship minus the roof
Just thought that I should get more credit than you
I'll strangle you with dreadlocks and my bear hands
Hip Hop's one of those things I'm proud I did
I respect your whole catalog and what you've said
Imagine what it'd look like at a hundred years old
You can't use mind control on a timeless soul
An emcee's lyrics defines his role
Close encounters with the poetic Buddha
The idea of aliens or anatomical subs
For dinosaurs that feed off our flesh and blood
I could literally kill you with a Hip Hop single
I can float a pound of steel with my mind
The lost unified field theory of Maxwell
The lies are transparent to see through
Uninhibited by the jet stream
And together we will find the truth
But you never check what Germaine think
They so shocked they didn't say shit
Lyrical Law is all about the lyrics
Goodnight... don't laugh don't cry
So just close your eyes
So fall deep into sleep to my lullaby
I recorded this in solitude
Probably the only opportune moment to talk to you
I honor you plus I got a lot of jewels to offer you
I know each of you got jewels to offer too
But only if the world knew what was possible
The gods and the goddesses above they watch us
While fallen angels make obstacles to stop us
Fear shuts down the evolution process
They usher in law and order through the back door
Atomic Godzilla just fucked Japan up
I'll tell what happened they went to them leader's pockets
They use fear and confusion to control us
Tell us to donate then rob us for our emotions
They pretend to lead the people like Moses
As the Rapture approaches they escape in the commotion
I came to tell you that the Angels believe in you
The first shall be last and last shall be first
That concept was here before man was on Earth
It's not gonna get better before it gets worse
I came to tell you that the angels believe in you
They want you to see the truth through the evil
They want you to know that ignorance weakens you
And they want us all to recognize that we are one people
And the righteous never have a right to deceive you
You've never seen me do nothing greedy or unreasonable
And build our faith up to fight the impossible
Forget what those motherfuckers promised you
I love you and I honor you
The god honest truth is that I would do the same thing if I was you
Comet 911 is coming nobody saying nothing
But we gotta figure out what to do
The first shall be last and last shall be first
That concept was here before man was on Earth
It's not gonna get better before it gets worse
I came to tell you that the angels believe in you
They want you to see the truth through the evil
They want you to know that ignorance weakens you
And they want us all to recognize that we are one people
I pray these words don't fall on deaf ears
Comet 911 is almost here
Do the research and find out for yourself
Stop waiting on somebody else to help
Allow me to introduce myself
Taking orders from the spiritual leaders
Underneath the blue skies over Egypt
The hours I spent tapping in the power of Zen
Go back and listen to my albums again
No matter what they won't allow me to win
It's a motherfucking conspiracy against my bloodline and my kin
Every time I rhyme I win
I'm a fool and I got no friends
But this goes back to the hours I spent practicing Zen
I don't look back on my actions and sins
I take it back to where it begins and just start rapping again
Until the laws of quantum becomes common like eating Raman
Noodles with shamans and breaking bread with which doctors
Don't ever let me hear you listening to such nonsense
I talk to vets with a modest respect
I'm a star spangle 850 pound Bengal
Albino teen idol episode got canceled
For the above average Hip Hop addict
All battle rap became fake
The organs sizzle with grease in the pan
Sometimes I spit a rhyme for the inner city schools
I talked about the fiftieth power to fifty dudes
But I'm going through the Hip Hop blues
Like Marilyn Manson in a band with Hanson
With horses with more legs then normal crustaceans
Engineer directly out of Full Sail
Spitting and grabbing facts and data to enhance ya
I still ain't understanding this shit
Who the fuck is you to criticize a lyrical king
I ain't heard nothing about it
I had to give you three years to recognize
The Internet is an early telepathic building set
My lyrics are international nuclear missile threats
But children don't understand the concept of consequence
But no I will not accept what the media says
They are the reason we are being mislead
I make up my own fucking mind
There are more of us than them
But at the same time they are gods and we are just mortal men
They are gods and we are just mortal men
I cannot imagine their power
They put a black family in the White House just so they can take away ours
Mommas and babies is crying
You can laugh at my appearance
But that don't mean I'm selfish
Soft but hard on the outside like shellfish
You won't do a motherfucking thing
The world was never ready for me
That's where the biggest demon is
But at least I got better beats now
I'd apologize but you acting like a real fag
Twelve years later I still don't get acknowledged for shit that I write
But I don't want to talk to you now
It'd be a motherfucking miracle if you even see me walking around
You a cyborg unit with no soul to it
Blood sacrifice or not
Minister of Information
Splice microphones with unknown chromosomes
To discover the codes that controls the brain's frontal lobes
Few of us will be alive by Solar Cycle 25
They won't be satisfied till every one of us die
The only way that you can free yourself is your mind
First thing you gotta do is put the antagonism behind
Then you gotta put ya life on the line
NO I will not forsake you for a paycheck
They monitor my body functions from central London
A robot arm shoves the drugs in
Says she wouldn't fuck me if I was her husband
Don't trust the bitch
I'm in a warehouse alone
Wouldn't matter anyway I'm in a paranormal zone
So I can learn to fly
So go find somebody else to dick ride
The Inconvenient Truth is a convenient 2-0-1-2
It's only logical its time for the truth
Whether I'm gonna be around to witness it or not
Cause you can't blackball the light
They know my hands always been tied
There's some things in this world that money can't buy
The media can not be trusted
You don't have to suck dick just to get your shot
Just work with what you got
50 plus bars is some new shit
50 plus bars is some new shit
Take it back to 1997 exclusive clue shit
With bucked teeth bust your guns or get rushed in the streets
To a dark room to witness your doom
Bash you in the face with the mag
Twenty four apprentices for hardcore fellowship
If you endure your mind's open doors
Complete the last step without crossing my rep
With combined payloads my glide bombs provide flows
That cause World War II death tolls at live shows
Independently targeted
Bombing shit from so high up in the atmosphere you lose consciousness
Intravenously cold blooded cooling coils are running through my jaws
We crucify you on a cross for a quarter
I'll erase your verse off the track so fast you'll wake up tired
Untouchable since the day I came out
How you like me in the future when I'm wearing that crown
You act like Hip Hop is all you listen to
Why get on the track if you can't stand next to me
So much energy it's a felony
Last night we wiped white stuff on her butt
You don't have to be scared of no strap

You can't add all the rhymes you had
Your mouth is a wound and your tongue is a scab
This is a concept the young mind doesn't grasp
That old stick in the mud will put a gold bullet in the gun
Show you where red blood comes from
No matter the lies that claim otherwise
This is Lyrical Law. not lyrical war
I murder a sixteen to the point that it's embarrassing
Shatter your heart's main vein pipe
Insane at night I might have your career disappear in plain sight
I'm bloodying punchlines like I assaulted a hundred zebras
Became a famous behemoth misbehaving angel
I'm bringing so much beef it'll make a Hindu kneel
The best thing you'll ever write is a suicide note
Keep to myself strategic for stealth
Tear the target to pieces reload and repeat it
I got a billion bars but I ain't got the time to release it
And you ain't got the time to listen to it

Wicked and wretched send you a message blow your ass out to the desert
Motherfucker's prepare for the unexpected
Any MC gets weak when he knows he's dead meat
If I strike you'll be red for weeks
You might check in with a beast that'll tan you like the Mexican heat
The steps to my monastery are steep
It can't get no hyper than this
Lyrical Law hands on jet turbo fans on
You bail out like Amelia Earhart
SEER training is for naught
They told me I'm few and far between like oasis to the wilderness
I'm still a mess but I climb it like a duplex
Barely get hellos in the morning but we wrestling
AM to the PM I'm preparing for the execution
I got the tent up in my hood with the chicken and the tater salad
Listen and you'll make it past this
Rapid fire comes the path to ghetto life
You're a fish in a school of whales
He changed it to Rip so that he could rap
There were those who observed to memorize what they heard
They enjoyed the rhymes and the sounds of the words
Such glorious poetry interwoven into code
Rip had written something that would never grow old
On the night of the Ripper's Eve
Little boys and girls would sit with crossed knees and begin to read
Their short size is only a disguise
Sipping hot cocoa slow in the middle of the snow
I wrote my first doctorate in confinement
Between the choices I have made and choices made for me
Reminds me of a story I should tell you in the morning
I moistened my fingers and turned the page
I'm amazed you never have to be told to behave
You raise your hand to speak and respond to your name
I remember... the day I had changed
The way I was struck by lightening in the rain
Maybe some other time I'll tell you what I became
I can tell you that I've waned in the pain of my shame
It is written in books and carved into skin
The triple six devil with a double had a metal muzzle
Containment chamber was connected to a metal tunnel
The whole planet is a memory card
Conditions harsh enough to make your heart stop at least once
Eventually you get used to it son
Gimme some water I'll be sober all night
Get so excited I go into a seizure and collapse on sight
My loved ones will mourn me
Others will continue to scorn me
The world will mourn what I wanted to be
They'll regret not achieving what I wanted them to see
Hes one of the few emcees alive that's qualified
With field experience to speak on the quality of rhymes
Design and do away with the assembly line
The Cheshire Cat stop showing teeth whenever I rap
Alternative energy source sustainability will shape the next century
The use of petroleum carries a penalty
All of a sudden they experts about it
Operation covert infinity
We must stave off any opposing subversive activity
Coattails following a frozen cold trail
Because the photographer bailed there's no details
Nobody was prepared for this
After the advent of wireless charging
I know what it feels like to be one of them
His voice is no longer unusually loud
A young boy walking on the street gets strip searched
Knowing it can be destroyed after servitude
Engineered as a biological weapon of warfare
Now with this I generate with more fear
Even though back then nobody cared and people wasn't as scared
I never used to get so much attention
Most of the top contenders at the time I was good friends with
For instance my man small pox was hot
He used to get between twelve and twenty thousand a week
All kinds of controlled substances
My man cancer was like Charles Manson
Cigarettes almost made the surgeon general ban them
AIDS is gold and HIV was platinum
AIDS is gold and HIV was platinum
Number one on the top ten and considered a worldwide threat
And transform your warm blooded bones to dry flesh
From running up in it raw ready and willing
AIDS is gold and HIV was platinum
Minorities from twenty to forty can't afford to ignore me
Raunchy ass parties where they be having orgies to transport me
Choose which one of the two demons in evil you trust
And most people don't question the person they having sex with
As to whether or not they infected
Even the people you already slept wit wouldn't suspect that they can catch it
And we only twelve percent of the population
It came straight from the world health organization
Here to diagnose that we dying quick
AIDS is gold and HIV was platinum
AIDS is gold and HIV was platinum
I'm about to black out with 100 bars on some professional shit.
Because I recognize it's all about timing
In front of twenty foot bonfires
With mercury ion rockets
That's why I got extraterrestrials that want to battle me
They even tried kidnapping me
And that's really what caused Roswell
Undercover operatives working for COM twelve
Hit you with nuclear cruiser missiles
Hear the wild wolf growl
Interrupt the cipher unannounced and you'll get punched in the mouth
With the Southpaw Southern fist
I'm an experiment gone bad
When I throw the Florence flask in my hand
Flammable liquids in the lab explode and you get stabbed with all the flying glass
Trained to blow up commercial aircraft
Dividing myself into a hundred ten times
You can't deny the offering's an offer
Flows that glow with aurora's that spark of light
I took an oath to rip everything I get on
In the wrist bones from gripping microphones this long
I'm just a small fish in a big pond
That gets pissed off whenever I get picked on
And night vision goggles
You need about a million more soldiers to even the odds
Plus eight hundred thousand to even consider a war
And two hundred thousand more to even look hard
You better drop your flag and withdraw
And drag y'all across the motherfucking asphalt
You mother fuckers really get on my nerves
I close my eyes when I freestyle so I could read what prints across them
Then raise my arms like a sorcerer and cast a fireball into the audience
I flame broil suckers
I dare a mother fucker to cross it
I'll even call my man Black Rob at two in the morning
Break your camcorders so you motherfuckers can't record it
Fuck the soft shit and fuck what y'all think
Got your picture taken and put in a tabloid
That's some sick shit homeboy
You got below average intelligence and poor penmanship
Take fifty cents and purchase a pack of peppermints
Tell me how you like it
See you've got to understand
I can't work a nine to five
So I'll be gone... till November
Yo I'll be gone till November
Gave my mom a hug for her soul when she cry
With some dark skinned brothers who looked Sicilian
Standing on the block where the spot get hot selling rocks
Guaranteed to get set up by a crooked cop
We raise Hell till the heavens fall
Over a quiet game of billiards
With the power to collapse buildings
Riding across the ocean floor like Poseidon on a seahorse
To reach our overseas tours
Now every time I make a run
Yo I'll be gone till November
Guaranteed to get set up by a crooked cop
You ain't invincible all we gotta do is get pissed at you
Point you out to some people that'll physically injure you
See you've got to understand
I can't work a 9 to 5
I came from the West Indies on some emcee shit
I double step for clips a day
When I'm done I make a thief of you
And I always share a piece of you
Prepare for the blitzkrieg blur of the Fuhrer
Put my CD in your Walkman and watch it slowly stir
One of the greatest rappers in the Universe
I have a Rip the Jacker conference
Get the Queen to sponsor it and invite members of parliament
I'll ask him if he's heard a hundred bars yet
Be psychotically complex climb on top secret documents
Show him that I'm not impressed and I'm not a threat
Tell him the album drops of October 25th
Fifteen pounds or fifteen hundred pence
I'll permanently fuck up your smile
I'm like a crook in your house or Foot and Mouth
Follow the Leader till you find Jesus
One in a million I flow brilliant
Bent spoons with my mind before but I never filmed it
You fronting if you never heard me spit ill shit
You lying if you said I never killed it
Opened the seventh seal after I revealed the sixth
The Ripper is more talented than Mr. Ripley and more risky than circus gypsies
And still remember the first time that I removed the man's kidneys
Mini machetes sharper than Wolverine's
Injections to the neck or suppress the screams
Leave clues behind for the forensics team that inspects the scene
Serial killing machines to the extreme
Truthfully the cut is too deep
And the motherfucking Rippers running loose through the streets
This is the Master Thesis underneath the deepness
Run a plot on the map in hyperspace ya
From the Society for Scientific Exploration
What I say vibrates no less than nine ways
And the black and white images fade into gray sound waves
Trap my adversaries like a mouse in a maze
With a bewildering array of lyrical display
My circularized third eye sees all
Atlantis was surrounded by four sea walls
I read one fourth of the Library of Alexandria
I wish I could have learned more
About the shapes of the Sacred Geometry they used to draw
Ancient in many ways but not nearly as old
With processed beryllium by the quintillion
They cooked on symmetrical stoves
With my logo etched above the hole where they inserted the coal
And they barbecued birds to the bone
I talked to Mr Fuller over the phone
And he said he had a contract to rebuild Rome
He said he didn't want to do it alone
I told him I was busy writing poems but I'd think about going
The process was slow and the doe was low
But I took it as the perfect opportunity to grow
Plus I had never traveled that far from home
That plays tunes from a laser black sax
Words concocted from the lyrical locksmith
From every angle the competition gets boxed in
As Dr. C indoctrinates his doctrine
Translated the English alphabet to the omega text
Life is now but death is next
Post bond out on bail from the belly of Hell
Communicate through diatonic and pentatonic scale
These dark side tales might effect sales
I set sail and hunt down erect sperm whales
Used an aphrodisiac to get a female
Your vocab is smaller than a cockatoo's
In the studio with James Lipton reminiscing
About the script that was written before the beginning
All of a sudden the boos turn to applause
Can't even count the bars I've expended so far
I wish the clock would hurry up and tick
In a rhyme the size of a Tylenol pill
I'll show you what poetry is really about
The side effects will make you pass out
Before the community of real emcees die out
These are the contents of the Covenant of the Ark
You've got to be as obsequious as the disciples of Jesus
Stand back talking shit like it's none of my business
Is you homo and you swallow dick
Now you're dealing with the problems and the politics
You the opposite of what I am
You in a wasteland pacing back and forth in the sand
I'm more independent than them
The only thing I give a fuck about is lead in my pen
I'm on a higher level than them
I didn't have to sell my soul to the devil to win
Maybe I should invest in some stocks and bonds
Drive out to Vegas and stick my cock in a few broads
Princesses tongue kiss frogs
On the West Coast you can do whatever the fuck you want
I was made on an assembly line
And my stitches were ahead of my time
I come in all assorted colors and dyes
Colors that attract eyes
And I'm worn by the kids on the streets
I keep you gripped to the ground
I'm the reason that people think you got style
The reason fans see you and smile
The reason you just too quick to be fouled
And I'm probably the same reason you the leading scorer in the league
The reason that you the nicest
The answer keeps you glued to the ground suspended in air
The answer to every prayer for every player everywhere
Try to block the shot if you dare
Killer crossovers split opponent's in half like moses
All contenders are left defenseless
They can't seem to deal with them pressure
I came to give you this message
I radiate like plutonium rods that glow
Patriarch with the heart of Napoleon Bonaparte
Stomp across continents to conquer my art
Rhymes hot enough to melt the wax off the turntable before the DJ even starts spinning it
My raps could melt the wax right off the back of Kid Icarus
You figure since you already a pussy you might as well give me syphilis
And you're lyrically limited to the little boxes you're living in
I've been dangerous from day one
Stick to your ribs like chicken and thick gravy from Roscoe's
You get your head flown if you dumb in the dome
Or struck with some stones till you feel numb in the bones
You better keep your big mouth closed
Before I stick the muzzle of my chrome in that hole under your nose
Send a signal to my index and tell it to fold
In the direction of my wrist bones to release your soul
But you chose the other route and got blown full of holes
Write your name on your tombstone scribbled in blood
Watch the Goat with the ghostwriter get slaughtered by a tiger
My style is sicker than infected women and men
I'm so raw I could catch AIDS without sticking it in
Flip and dip like shrimps and scampi
Switch my language like a black kid raised by a Spanish nanny
To a level you could never explain
A real pain in the ass that got smacked for saying my name
And now you look like a ass in pain
Sweeter than a handful of granulated sugar
But watch the shit hit the fan when that cat Can pull up
For messing with me or my brethren
And you definitely can't coach perfection
Take a hammer and smash the stone your name was etched in
Then I'll announce that I'm running for the new election
Then death by getting your head severed is an honorable way to end it
Otherwise your wasting your time
Going blind trying to keep up with these lyrical lines
They stand and stare as I appear upon a cushion of air
Hot enough to sunburn Satan
Hotter than white people taking vacation
And they become cancer patients
Make lightening flash across the sky every time I curse
Put a crown of thorns on whoever the king of rap is
If he's a Catholic I'll nail him to a crucifix
Beat him with two whips with pieces of broken glass glued to it
Your whole crew get spayed and neutered
Your armored cars and your Kevlar vests is useless
Slam her body on the hook then I skin her
From her stomach till it shows her liver
Leave the blood dripping from her raggedy house slippers
We'll be getting pussy
Until they see the chrome racked out
I spit a verse so powerful enough to put the Earth back in balance
The first time I spit I knocked the Earth upon its axis tilt
Too wide to get around and too silent to puncture
With the gravity of a collapsed star
I rock shoes like nobody could take it to Hell with them
My brain make it rain triple five storms
Idolize the thorn when I spit a load of clips are formed
I love my team more than I love my bitch
My verbal chemistry can kill you with esoteric energy
I bury motherfuckers in the cemetery for testing me
Seven six five four three two one
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you fuck you my attitude is anemic
For more Millenniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
And I'm daring every MC in the game
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth don't ever step out of line
Above the skies of America no matter whatever the weather be
Multiple mixed messages begin a new dawn in history
I volunteered myself to merge with spirits during celestial visits
Discover new physics through my beautiful lyrics
Experimenting with the latent powers of the human mind
Designed to evolve the populace who were falling far behind
Clairvoyantly channeling the answer to the great equation
The code cracking team discovered a world like no other
From the perspective of the planets we are all sisters and brothers
I am still the great oracle I can see into the future
The populace finally figured out that loves the missing answer
You sit there and listen to the beat and the lyrics
Let them resonate with you to awaken your spirit
Set goals in your life that you deeply desire
The layers of reality infallibly shifting everywhere
The cycles of time proceed to take this effect much further
My sole purpose on this planet is my souls purpose
Looking into the near future the dollar has become rendered useless
We're all bound around the sounds of profound underground
In a newly ordered world of higher density
The earth magnified by increased energy
It's like stomping on a whole crate of porcelain plates
Then bite you with poisonous fangs for trying to fuck with the champ
Before engineers was using pro tools
I'm probably what you would call a
Record industry population enforcer
In order to keep this shit in order
I always stay focused the longest
I promise I can battle any artist till they just get exhausted and forfeit
Now I got some banging ass beats now
And I can murder any God Damn camp I concentrate on
You know me I'm about that rhyme
A rack of bombs lay stacked on the floor above the doors of the Bombay
I could drop bombs all day
My metaphors break jaws out of place
Drag you by the feet with thirty feet of rope
One millions views of that moment you lose
Against the freckle faced Elephant Man
With cold clammy gelatin hands research and develop the plan
Radio ain't got no more tolerance
You can't verify the shit that he claim
Every time I run a program they erase it
Fully automated battle drone
Show them how you got the right to rock with me
So I don't know why you got a nine with you
Gave you a style you could use
Now you fucking with some grimy dudes
Your blood could end up on the bottom of shoes
I put bars of galls between your bladder walls
Show you what a black hole could do to a star
It's going down from the troposphere to the ground
Everybody's mouth moving but you can't hear a sound
Nothing but trace of rounds in the gun
Puffing a chalice with the beef eaters
Getting so high that whenever I drop shit
It'll land on the window of your airplane cockpit
Then you don't need six senses to feel me punch you in the face
Drunk as Lady Diana's driver with reporters behind her
Alcohol in the hands of a minor
And when we do shows we make the queen pay admission
Me without lyrics is like a porn flick without sex
Like them clothes white boys be wearing
There ain't a microphone brave enough to give me feedback
I'm strong my word is bond like James
They should come with a large drink and a biscuit
A little bit of weed and some Hennessey
Got me ready to set it with kinetic energy
See I need much more energy then my enemies
If I want to make more Bill's than Bellamy
Then when I'm on the scene I do shows to get the green
Then I take the green buy a automobile machine
Long enough for me to give you one last message
Like you got something to prove
Get everything in the club thrown at you and your crew
You got a album out you'll get hit with your CD too
While I be in the lab composing forbidden scriptures
To all the female fans that want a backstage pass
The tickets will be there in advance
Kicking it to a chick about his height
Shorty looking at me real bashful
To a venue with a twelve hundred capacity maximum
A storm that's hardcore but silent
Turn the club into a giant frying pan
And mess around and get your mouth slapped dry
I scar your whole squad with bullet scars
But I wipe them all out like Booty
And kill the competition to win
I spit a verse not of this Earth
Colder than the heart of a murk
Remember once upon a time not long ago I lived in the snow
I wore a heavy coat and hunted with stones
I can't wait till we get back to boast
I was roadside ambushed with a blown off foot
I grab my bow cutter and breach the sand bunker
Hot sun rays beam down on the driver fiend
Then spread into a pie wedge till everything behind you is dead
Make a foolish move and lose your life
I pounce on you like a panther jump over a Mini Cooper
Then rip your top open like a can of chunky tuna
My super bust off bars and jaws bite through ya
While you flapping your wings and crying like a rooster
What you gonna do huh get mad and lose son
The Altered Beast brand you with the mark of the beast
Then hand you over to a warlord chief
For fifty pieces of silver and a nickel back of sticky
My back pain is back again in the form of a back strain
I took another ibuprofen
2 o'clock sharp we have an ancillary cook off
Under the pine trees of Fort Bragg
Now I'm about to lose my kids and my marriage
They send rescue choppers and helicopter news teams out
Rockets turn choppers into a tree house
White grenades smoke screen the street out
SWAT teams and riot squads grab shields but can't see now
All you can see is red beams in the ground
Fire brigades fight to contain chemical plant hazards
Inside the detox box I watch the clock
Outside the box I'm supposed to protect Hip Hop
Only the minds of the independent can hear this
Civilian population fear this
The hypercube room I don't know where it is
Microphone terrorist bare fist with brad tips
Below her breast she a cosmetic bitch
No matter how bad I sound when they hear me
Half man half wolf I daredevil off of the roof
And land on both twos so don't move
Pounce teams listens to Al Green
Everybody in town dreams that they saw the same cloud screen
The Majestic Mic Master Messiah
Metallic hawk talons knock sharks off balance
Even went to see a play called Hamlet in all Spanish
Everyday that goes by I feel less important
Two weeks after the President to give us some medicine
Never stereotype or it'll be a sound burial tonight
Amidst spits and notes Germaine wrote
Pardon a poor pauper with nothing to offer from his coffin
Coughing up a mouthful of volcanic sulfur
Walking towards the altar
Force get pitchforked out of orbit
NY pheromones interact with my poems
Attack those who are not alone like hollow bones
I spike radiation readings just by bleeding
If I bite whatever I'm eating when I'm night feeding
Get that toxic spill mopped up
Don't mess up when you verse your rhyme or you will be circumcised
Then your foreskin will look worse than mine
Metaphors explore spaceships on the day ship from stingray cliff
My arms ten foot long koala bear claws
If you can't calm down you being chased by white tooth
Produce draws I administer to my patients
Acoustic placement behind rhymes that are ageless
And go wherever I choose to take it
Master of the Matrix. mutilate the music when I say shit
So you can bury my body below Earths crust
I rip the scab off and lay in the cut
My rhymes cut through the radio waves like machetes
The predator becomes the prey in the
I breach National Security purposely
To safely return the statue of Freddie Mercury
A scientific division of lyricism
Outside the physical prism we swim in
They misrepresent with negative negligence
I was sent to monitor and develop intelligence
My wife and child were both killed in a helicopter crash
The ones I still know ain't got no jobs
I joined the army so I could be armed
Do something before they drop a bomb on your lawn
Deep underground military base dumb smart bombing
He put me in the pit with the monsters
That's where I swore my rites in
And tell me where my girlfriend went with him
Transportation provided on the tarmac
We landed in Atlantis
V for the virtuous virgin wearing violin strings
W is just the V and its twin
In God's name who would even think such a thing
But do not interrupt me in the booth
I devour prey every hour a day
Fight naked so you can't hide nothing up your sleeve
Beyond the Universe and back
Or you can fuck off and get a real job
Both dog hard camouflage face frogs
Kaleidoscope bars and asymmetrical war
Rhymes accelerate through the cyclotrons in nine microns
The opposite of a black lung is a white one
I'll bring a new meaning to the phrase dead end
Crack your teeth till you mouth sounds like a tambourine
With an automated overbite
If it wasn't for the AV camera installed in the AC
I wouldn't know you roll your eyes at me when you embrace me
And stop talking about me in the third person
You told me that you love me when you hate me
There's only one way to wait for me and that's patiently
The ripper spills whiskey from a flask
There's a difference in the ways we were made to behave
I landslide you to the lava below
You never seen an emcee do it this well
Everyday we battle at Saint Germaine's Chapel
Creates art from an upstate New York motor park
And won't get off his high horse to come talk unless it's important
Your style ain't flawless you just rap like it
From afar playing the notes I was taught
The HRH of time and space
Numismatic treasure chest stashed in the attic
I spent my wonder years carrying nothing but guns and gear
My quotes end up inside your throat
That my Dali Lama prayer give me cauliflower ears
I've been rhyming for years
I rip up your bones in a funeral home
Mix match the code name Squid Chatter
I swim in a shark tank and feed off rappers
Animals in a shed on a Moor bed
Every living thing listening to me sing
Car's ride by with the booming systems
Asleep in the bread aisle eating some biscuits
Yeah now how y'all feel out there
You hear my spoken better than when Rae lost his focus
And unload bars like they're several joy shots
That'll surely be your last at your burial grounds
But evolved over the course of time
That's why I'm on the job with balls to supercharge your ions
Fact or fiction I can't tell the difference when half of these rappers spit
I guess them folks won't ever be dope no matter how much they practice it
There's so many things for you to fathom but for now it's class dismissed
Keep it real recognize the skills over the beat
You got to find out who you help
There's no way to tell
For me this all happened because of a record deal
You pay homage to me electronically
One out of three speak about they flawed philosophies
I walk around hooded in the streets
So do not even look up at what you are beneath
Just stare straight ahead and pretend you're on the beach
I fell to my knees then they shot me with a laser
One day I'm a show you what we all made
The heart of your soul is in the planet
Don't look at me unless you want a challenge
I stopped in my tracks to ask what you looking at
The majority wants peace
But cannot peacefully overpower the authority of the beast
Innocent lives being crushed from both sides
Proximity explosive devices are inside your pen
Different but I'm the same. sometimes I sound same
Imagine a world where there are lyrical spirits
Of a kind from a force far greater than you'll find
The rhymes will enter your mind then energize
I choke ghosts from my past with a rope made of ether 9 gas
Then I let the evil times pass
But they will put your assassin in shackles
Many days are spent plotting and planning your revenge
Listening to oldies but ain't got no homeys
Some spirits are dark and twisted
We all rise and decline above or below that line
And continue to either climb or dive
Killer bee collective mind back at the hive
Sting you a million times just for acting all shy
Shut the... before I put you in the trunk
Get some. that's how you get revenge you little punk
Keep a brown man down sport
Barricaded so you can't move around now
Buried six feet deep beneath the ground now
My loud sound pound down make the earth crush in and bow down
Yo when Mo Black start to black out bitches pass out
Stick my black dick in they mouth and dig they back out
Or I'll quickly take you to 1950 and do you like the British
Tan lotion on they white flat ass and shit
Now ain't nobody fucking with the mastermind
All wrapped up in the body in one human
I'll smack you with a backhand
And stalk my own rap fans
I'm like a madman fighting a war
Blow you away with a force that'll leave your body lost
I rock till I can't rock no more
Till I can't get no motherfucking props no more
Till they boo me on stage when I'm out on tour
Claws rip through walls of cast iron
Flatter than a Yankee baseball cap rim
I was aiming with the red dot
Waiting for the order to take the head shot
Communications was unstable
You couldn't pick a more impossible fantasy
They don't believe the planet is my family
Exercising will yield better rhyming like me
Politicians fess up to how badly the fuck they messed up
Of the subject to get justice but not just yet
About what I can clearly see coming
I took precise pictures of the hellish void on celluloid
With a Polaroid but it was destroyed
I'm complacent of my creature comforts
One verse from me is a Sunburst that make dust of the Earth
Create a bunch of words and bend the curve of how they are heard
Like a witchdoctor talks to the dead
He realized he got popped and went into shock
They left him for the cops
By the time they got there they had to just get a mop
Put a million observations into one conversation
He was attacked by an unknown assailant
React like a cat when he arches back
I slap y'all motherfuckers like y'all little kids in kindergarten
I knock the teeth out ya gums and suck the breeze out ya lungs
Hit ya wit a blow your physical frame could never sustain
You'll probably never walk ever again
You'll be scared to leave the club wit us
Three times it's likely to feel clear
With super vocals quicker than superman can find a phone booth
I'm the only guy that knows why the golden eye
Was stolen by five soviet spies
Chop my hands off at the armpits but I regenerate limbs
Swallow my beeper and page myself so I can communicate with a dolphin
Bright lights in your eyes with them silver gammas
I use amnesia to neutralize public panic
In the back of his cranial cavity
The UFO wreckage was just the beginning
My spirit still too close for you to come near it
And a hundred more of them
My speech starts to blend in multiples of ten
I gain solace every rhyme I deposit
The VA gave me some post combat chronic
Sergeant Gunnery rapid response recovery
I new man emerge badly burned
Out in Florida low key
The Commando throws his dough in his ranch home
Before the sunrise in the valley of the Moon
I howl like I mean it
Inside the detox box I watch the clock
Outside the box I'm supposed to protect Hip Hop
Only the minds of the independent can hear this
Civilian population fear this
The hypercube room I don't know where it is
Microphone terrorist bare fist with brad tips
Fuck with the Brass Monkey
Look up when honey's ass is above me
She a high class rap junkie
Below her breast she a cosmetic bitch
The snake eats the canary
They issued an order not to come near me
No matter how bad I sound when they hear me
Half man half wolf I daredevil off of the roof
And land on both tubes so don't move
Pounce teams listens to Al Green
Everybody in town dreams
That they saw the same cloud screen
The Majestic Mic Master Messiah
Even went to see a play called Hamlet in all Spanish
Everyday that goes by I feel less important
Climbing the pyramid two blocks at a time
The wolf has no constituent need to bark back
Rocket propelled bars from a Alaska's largest national park
Where helicopters crash in the dark.
You are reading what I'm seeing
He possess all knowledge known
Something that we understand naturally
They put me in charge of the new Tiger Team
To copy rap flows nowadays is no challenge
Smoke don't rise in the opposite direction
Overhead projectors don't stop till perfection
Recording rhymes like I'm soldering wires
Behind giant porcelain tigers with needle nose pliers
Tell General Myers I'll fix both fighters
Situational awareness of all areas
Knowledge is the disease we are all carriers
Put fucking blisters on your iris
Ten observations per satellite
I build and destroy like the City of Troy
Most of y'all remain bubble
Do the math I'm a classic rebel
My phone talk tear your jaw bones off
Burn your nose off with a charcoal mark
Helicopter you from the side like Tartar
Took a minute to exhibit that I'm sick with it
At a thousand degrees Celsius I make emcees melt
Like a javelin to stab you in the abdomen
The intellectual athlete accurately rapping so rapidly
Yet he makes perfect sense mathematically
Rhymes ricochet off the inner walls of my lungs
And go past the tongue faster than bullets come out of guns
Whenever the head is severed from the human body with a sharp enough weapon
The brain remains conscious for ten seconds
I'll hop into the back seat of a cab and rhyme
I'm hardcore from the nappy follicles in my pores
From my jaws to my torso where my organs are stored
And from my balls in my drawers to the floor
I pray to God they hurry up and start the Third World War
I don't give a fuck if you rich or you poor
Don't give a fuck if you got your picture in The Source or Forbes
I don't give a fuck who won an award
Let they blood pour all on the floor
I'll leave your corpse stiff as a board
Getting in my way is like jumping in front of a car
I'll send you to hell where you belong
Who could flow for four minutes or more
Got millions of styles and I've mastered them all
A metaphor matador fast enough to make the bull charge and crash in the wall
Get everything in the club thrown at you and your crew
I'll snatch your crown with your head still attached to it
I'll battle you with a gun to my neck
I'd rather be a lion for a day than a lamb who lives forever
Lyrics got my undivided loyalty
And there ain't nothing on this God damn planet that's worth more to me
I'd beat his ass and took my tape back
Then I bust you with a shotgun blast
It's not fun so I don't laugh
Trapped in a max security building
Suffering from a severe illness called brilliance
They sent doctors in protective suits
Army recruits in small groups
Tortured me for the truth
Rapped me in cellophane and dumped my body in the trunk of a coupe
Instead I find myself blindfolded
Being interrogated by some highly professional agent
One in the background was Jamaican
He offered me a piece of plant but I wouldn't take it
Lupe lasers to the face disable you
Can't take a motherfucking thing from me
Make you drink an oil drum full of fish chum
Another bay area mission
Subsequent to the usage of such applied techniques
Lyrical law behind the beacon of thought
I'm like Igor with eagle claws ripping meat off
The barrel of the shotgun bigger than a beer mug
In the struggle for survival brothers become rivals
Mothers become homicidal cussing at the bible
Universal personal trainer for lyrical fitness
I'm here to observe you not hurt you
The greater and the lesser can only become better
In the struggle for survival brothers become rivals
Mothers become homicidal cussing at the bible
In the struggle for survival brothers become rivals
Mothers become homicidal cussing at the bible
In the struggle for survival brothers become rivals
Mothers become homicidal cussing at the bible
In the struggle for survival brothers become rivals
Mothers become homicidal cussing at the bible
Delineating what is invading from what is escaping
Solutions for saving Hip Hop that are still in the making
As soon as I stop talking I stop producing carbon
Spitting indigenous verses for medicinal purposes
Ammonia distilled from dung fills in my lungs
Take water from Jordan river and share it with rippers
I share the truth and do the best I can do
And you can't do all of the beats yourself
You can't do it without the streets help
I use to rhyme like all day
I use to train with myself in the mirror
That's the difference between you and me
I'm just in the booth right now
I definitely ain't scared of you
Just as long as I get to damage you
If you a lion I'm a tiger too
Look you in the eyes and lie to you
My verbal weapon fires a whole clip of rhymes before you can get off one round
A ground underneath the ground before underground bunkers
Then garlic bread sticks in their eye sockets and taste them
Hindus in India will kneel to the floor and worship cows and rats as gods
I used to be naive and dress fresh when I was small
I illuminate the atmosphere a million watts strong
I've got a round and automatic for you mortals out of line
You can't stop the shining
Can't stop the shining
You can't stop the shining
I duplicate the sound God makes when he farts in space
Them cats say I'm wicked
The way I just kick it
For you to come and get it
The impact of the rush will leave you decapitated
Your style's been deflated
I know you prayed for my downfall
I'm platinum plus and you're silver still and...
For me to carry hundred thousand pound boast radios
Live land mine behind enemy lines
Military paratroops with camouflage parachutes
In flight suits and boots landing on your roof
Eliminate the target is the prime objective
I create psychic walls harder than cement is
With the hepatitis b vaccine
Navy seal team make a bitch scream
I try to enjoy my life with paranoid nights
I absorb what I write through the orb of light
Fire ya brain and half a dozen Cerebellum muffins
You alive but your internal organs be outside
The whole world's a big lie and I think I'm inside
The spirit of Eva Braun on my lawn at dawn
I was calm but I still told the bitch she don't belong
Try to fathom who wrote the song
Whenever I spit bars three quarters of Special Forces pause
They wanna see what comes out of my jaws
Keep searching for Colonel Kirks till he put you in a world of hurt
One air strike leave your whole world burnt
Ancient poetry delivered from a modern day mouth
Make a nice leather pouch with the remainder of your scalp
Explain how you disappeared before the movie came out
The damage is collateral
Trap you in a everlasting loop
See if you can fuck with it
We aim lyrics downrange
I come correct every rhyme I make
The all eye seeing stereotype in the rhyme scheme
Somebody as bright as light beams read the words inside the screen
Raw metaphors keep you high fa months
Ain't too many categories I can fit in
I gotta arm wrestle my pen to write it
I got the shotgun pumped
I possess the lyrical ammo to battle
I'll battle you on the net
I'll battle you in the flesh
I'll battle you over the phone you can call me collect
I'll battle you for the respect
I'll battle you over a blank check
I'll battle you wit a gun to my neck
I crush a piece of coal and create a diamond
Then crush a thug's bones like a chrome slug
Leave you laying dead in your own blood
I'm the scariest Sagittarius you ever seen
The fiends that rock men till I'm top of the top ten
Then I make your whole crew sweat my music
Mental blows that hit you in your dome like clench fist
Competition is usually forced to forfeit
My celebrity bench presses more than a forklift
Don't even step to me on some bullshit
I can kick a freestyle any time you demand it
Breaking sound barriers like the Lockheed
While you sit and wonder how I just took the life of another
Me and my brother jump in the Jeep and burn rubber
Disciplined like Olympic gold medalists
Unless you got a death wish and you want to mess with
Women who poison the walls of their wombs with asbestos
Whatever you trying to buy somebody is selling it
Inextricably infallible
To assume that I could lose if I battled you
My scholastic aptitude is 1,602
A 100 bars was just a glimpse of the truth
Physical proof that I'm the best at this
More then any of you rappers ever spit
By an administrative assistant with deep throat
Humping a whore tampering with the republican vote
Flying circles around you like flying saucers
Flying circles around the Royal Air Force's flying fortress
Looking for a home taking all calls and offers
Notify the prince and the Duke of Earl
I've got fans like beads on an abacus
My styles totally out the bracket
Scientist with thick glasses and pocket protectors want to patent it
My talent is unmatched by any rapper in this rapping biz
By any rapper on this planet's grid
To bomb his coordinates with Agent Orange and torture him
Rip the towel off then pour salt on him
Continue my verbal assault on him till it's twelve in the morning
And turn into the werewolf monster on him
Smarter then any man in Scotland Yard is
English speaking emcee in the European region
Rip you to pieces like communism leaflets
Without a jacket outside when it's freezing
Another dog joint production
This beat is bigger than just one rhyme
This is like the intro to the beginning of time
This beat is bigger than just one rhyme
This is like the intro to the beginning of time
Probably the best fashion if you have it
The only one he open up to is you
But it never sound tougher than mines
So much time passed I just can't adjust all the time
There are fifty thugs in the room here's what we done
The gravity pull your body apart like mozzarella
You just flow loud with no know how
Sourdough biscuits and warmed up beans
Loud buzzers indicate that you're all outnumbered
Got caught in the remedy of an untimely loss
Hit you so hard my hand breaks and my shoulder dislocates
It's like stomping on a whole crate of porcelain plates
Then bite you with poisonous fangs for trying to fuck with the champ
Half of the square root of my IQ is beyond you
Now you're on the floor immobilized
Screaming that you never wanted to die till I put one in your eye
Before engineers was using Pro Tools
Make my own rules no matter what I flow to
In the beast's belly you can't have peace without wars
If I had half as many bars in gold
As I had in lyrics when I flowed
I'd be the richest man on the globe
Five thousand degrees hotter than flame throwers
Like pilots that fly Russian MIG
From the lowest point in the planet to Mt. Everest
Fuck forbidden fruit I was eating pussy in Genesis
Now I said it once and I'll say it a thousand times
You fuck around and get clotheslined till you nosedive
We can rhyme fair and square or fair in the sphere
They stand and stare as I appear upon a cushion of air
Motherfuckers start again to the point
Where they faces shrivel up like raisins
And they become cancer patients
Power to hold my breath for half an hour
And piss in they trousers
Water molecules get transformed to vapors
Electromagnetic cassettes melt tape decks
Amateur swordsmen gets stabbed through they face mask
Trying to escape death
A world where the whole globe will contract Ebola
Fraternity of the Impoverished
Because of all the hardships that I've been through
Symbolic Hip Hop prophet speak to your subconscious
French politics got the public thinking the opposite
Drilling holes through the Faraday cages of your brains
Then I implant the arcane image of Saint Germaine
High lyrical exponent intelligence quotient
When I'm focused I can engage multiple opponents
Verbose with emotions of psychosis
A real MC don't have to do what he don't wanna do
I'd rather die by living brave then live like a slave
I'd rather be broke then be fake and get paid
These layers of physicality challenge me
My soul is gold and it's the only thing that's able to balance me
My energy body has a alchemical copy that looks godly
The national debt says that the US is a vagina
Of a black widow spider spraying blood out like a geyser
The potential of life versus the potential of death
Either way you go through mad mental stress
We ignored the gems now we gotta do it all again
We failed Hip Hop's laws and brought down shame upon our cause
Now we will fall upon our swords
The Shaman pays homage to Solomon
Every now and then I get retarded and spit
I would like to apologize to every artist I dissed
Everybody assumes that I wanna rhyme but I don't
Sometimes I just wanna chill and watch you flow
Ripped out the vocal cords of the people
I walk up to your bed side disguised with red eyes
And tell you to remember these rhymes
I lined it up with the planet's equinox
It's the savage ode of the tragic microphone maverick
But nevertheless I'm waiting for the next time
The metaphor sorcerer slaughter ya poor orchestra
I'm rapping with savagery
The rules don't apply like I'm the government
I buy the rights to you're publishing the throw your masters right in the rubbish bin
And writing albums in the Arabic alphabet's characters
I should release a picture version of my rhyme pad
It's a one sided affair like necrophiliac sex
These animals are dangerous with teeth sharper than razors
I'll pump you with compressed air until you hold your chest there
Mankind will control his thoughts until he ceases to be
I could spend my whole life underground like a ferret
Spitting these hardcore lyrics with minimal interference
My appearance is reminiscent of Edgar Allen's spirit
When I shine like the Ark of the Covenant
But it's the atheists that don't hear me
I was summoned as the dominant Providence lyricist
Parliament getting uplifting compliments from communistic
I harnessed it and polished it before other artist did
As the honest prophet with an anomalous source of partnership
I'll show you what the meaning of slaughter is
To get my point across with his finger towards a crucifix
This lucrative movement is passing
Universe like Atlas when I rap shit
My deoxyribonucleic acid is the reason I'm that sick
I heard the opportunity and followed it
So I can really guarantee your departure
You was the martyr for me to slaughter from border to border
This is lyrical fitness for all of Earth
I be ripping through more Trojans than Achilles in Troy
My rap refracts the rhythm
The beats stand behind this line until I give them permission
She told me my dark energy was energetic and I must respect it
She told me the Universe was pregnant and I was the father
Shit that's a whole lot to swallow
My alien friend... my alien friend
My two inch reels are hermetically sealed
Deep underground military base too
Light from within touch the ring around the firing pin
The Universal Mind is wired in
A hundred grid bed nuclear motors
Doors to the memoirs of metaphors
Leads you down a hall on the edge of a waterfall
Just left the confession box my Lord
Close circuit security level four
My cranium is an aquarium with fish
My compact disc make your compact glitch
It's called metaphor by eating
This is what is to be expected with no direction
A probe was sent to get an answer for a question in a sentence
Not to mention what ever I recommended when the verse ended
Worth their own weight in gold in the game
Lord Finesse in the flesh spit a bar per request
I feel as if everything I've learned
Has made be obsolete before I could even say one word
What I said it not what you heard or what you thought you observed
The vision is getting blurred but you have to be sure
Blood gushing from the puncture wound hole in your shirt
What does it feel like to be a rap legend
Underground manure rap from the sewer rat
I came from the West Indies on some emcee shit
I double step for clips a day
When I'm done I make a thief of you
And I always share a piece of you
Prepare for the blitzkrieg blur of the Fuhrer
Put my CD in your Walkman and watch it slowly stir
One of the greatest rappers in the Universe
I have a Rip the Jacker conference
Get the Queen to sponsor it and invite members of parliament
I'll ask him if he's heard a hundred bars yet
Be psychotically complex climb on top secret documents
Show him that I'm not impressed and I'm not a threat
Tell him the album drops of October 25th
Fifteen pounds or fifteen hundred pence
I'll permanently fuck up your smile
I'm like a crook in your house or Foot and Mouth
Follow the Leader till you find Jesus
One in a million I flow brilliant
Bent spoons with my mind before but I never filmed it
You fronting if you never heard me spit ill shit
You lying if you said I never killed it
Opened the seventh seal after I revealed the sixth
The Ripper is more talented than Mr. Ripley and more risky than circus gypsies
And still remember the first time that I removed the man's kidneys
Mini machetes sharper than Wolverine's
Injections to the neck or suppress the screams
Leave clues behind for the forensics team that inspects the scene
Serial killing machines to the extreme
Truthfully the cut is too deep
And the motherfucking Rippers running loose through the streets
The dark ruler in the dark blue Star Cruiser
Iron Lung's wire tongue tied fungus up in a bun
Make your rhymes shrivel up to lime rust
The bombs lay stacked on the floor above the door
A snake swallowing himself from the tail
With lyrics the whole industry silently enjoyed
I'm so nice I amaze myself
I just listen to the playback and chase myself
A hundred generations later my rap style's still greater
Rip the Jack spit liquid crack
I knelt down emotional meltdown
Shadow behind the curtain in the window
Watch what I'm about to get into
There's no rap law that says I can't rhyme how I want
Shut the fuck up and go make a sandwich
Don't get attached to that emotional crap
A bible in your hotel
Lyricism about speech
Broken down to different sounds compliance all around
How many rhymes memorized plus those set aside...
You are waiting for the moment to die
Winchester Williams spit silent winded
Talk sex to sister with my finger on the Twitter
Scuffle over a game of pinochle
Unless you want trouble
Girls grope then I smile
Right after I played ball
I'll turn the baddest bitch gay y'all
At this other lady's pad
To get it on I had to call up Desert Storm
Cause my street soldiers are heat holders and weed rollers
We keep 2 bones and 2 phones in each Rover
With Jimmy Jones right next to me in the Benz Truck too
Frozen and drowning with diamond boulders all in the crown
Ghost you and pound your corpse with a force that'll open the ground
And now I take you for a walk through the ghetto
Either spark your metal or get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that but don't think I won't counter act
With the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose
My crew shit on cats without Tiffany
I've been fucking with Clue since he made 60 minute tapes
We copped mad bottles and crushed many grapes
We from the hood and they from the hood
Took the game right over at the time they could
I got 2 albums and 2 cars
I sold 163 thou on my 1st week
That means I got more fans than you
My motherfucking brain is IBM compatible
My style is hard like castle without McCormick
I run threw your crew like the flu when I bomb it
My style's like AIDS cause don't nobody want it
Then trespass on your property like Monopoly
Subdue your crew and beat that ass properly
Welcome to the Desert Storm annual extravaganza
I chop off heads just to take the necklace
And fuck around and get your mouth slapped dry
You could battle me and possibly survive
But you could never see me and walk away without a black eye
Scar your whole squad with bullet scars
It don't matter whether they on or off duty
I murder you brutally when I spit at you
I spit a verse where the evil lurks
Then maybe they'll leave the Earth
This is what the alligator said to the little human toddler
But he stopped saying it when he saw the toddler's father
Dirty cotton tips from cleaning my nose breathing dirty oxygen
Eyewitness news hot topics at 10
Grind time co writer and flow fighter
I'm having a drink with my mates
I don't want to talk about space
I don't want to do an about face
Where I have to talk about race
The eyes watch hands like canines
Things are going to be fine
I got a new insurance policy signed
And I don't need anybody to remind me
I spit a verse where the evil lurks
Fraternity of the Impoverished
Because of all the hardships that I've been through
Symbolic Hip Hop prophet speak to your subconscious
French politics got the public thinking the opposite
Drilling holes through the Faraday cages of your brains
Then I implant the arcane image of Saint Germaine

I should release a picture version of my rhyme pad
It's a one sided affair like necrophiliac sex
These animals are dangerous with teeth sharper than razors
I'll pump you with compressed air until you hold your chest there
React with a couple screws loose like Rasputin
Say goodbye to life once you're in my iron sights
And you can try to fight buddy but you die tonight
You're better off standing in a thunderstorm and flying kites
What I say sprays and I'll take aim at your dome
Narrowly escape the grenades that are thrown
But you got no place to go I already devastated your home
Mankind will control his thoughts until he ceases to be
I could spend my whole life underground like a ferret
Spitting these hardcore lyrics with minimal interference
My appearance is reminiscent of Edgar Allen's spirit
When I shine like the Ark of the Covenant
But it's the atheists that don't hear me

This is lyrical fitness for all of Earth
I be ripping through more Trojans than Achilles in Troy
Get acquainted to the one and the only
The ninety percent of my brain that I ain't even used yet
When the female egg will merge with the man's sperm
Then I'll attack you with words that's absurd
It came to me like God's word
Told them not to try nothing funny or I'd kill them all
They still never responded
Three of the hostages started crying
Get acquainted to the one and the only
The ninety percent of my brain that I ain't even used yet
When the female egg will merge with the man's sperm
Then I'll attack you with words that's absurd
I'd be the richest man on the globe
Coming to punish you pigs
I'm probably what you would call a
Record industry population enforcer
Just like the stories of the hare and the tortoise
I always stay focused the longest
I promise I can battle any artist till they just get exhausted and forfeit
Now I got some banging ass beats now
I've been accused of being all hype
Every night I got into a bar fight
Must have been a typo
The type of rhymes I be spitting
For all my enthusiasts that love my music
With microprocessors submerged in cryogenic fluids
Always had this gift as a child
I hold on to they thong start striping it down
If I cough in my fist when I open my hand
The iron clad nomad my flow smash rip up the whole jam
When I leave the audience hold hands
Hand ya face back to you pleasantly
For thinking anything less of me then you better be Hennessey
While ya man is yelling code Red I reload again
It made ya man stop talking
Its hard to see the white meat after I hot sauce him
It's not about paper I'm not talking
Strap the visor gold with it
I've got more rhymes than I do time
Every grid square is consumed by bombs from an air balloon
Fucking murder eleven out of a Dirty Dozen and I'm still hunting
Snap bitches like paparazzi snap pictures
Attack the whole hit list for half your listeners
I don't give a fuck what the public wanna buy
So come get some little bum
When the time comes I won't even take blood
I got out the Matrix when I was unplugged
I walk upright but I'm savage and uptight
Goals and desires are old and expired
Everything I owned was bankrolled in the fire
George Bush The Button
I've got more rhymes than I do time
Every grid square is consumed by bombs from an air balloon
Fucking murder eleven out of a Dirty Dozen and I'm still hunting
Snap bitches like paparazzi snap pictures
Attack the whole hit list for half your listeners
I don't give a fuck what the public wanna buy
So come get some little bum
When the time comes I won't even take blood
I got out the Matrix when I was unplugged
I walk upright but I'm savage and uptight
Goals and desires are old and expired
Everything I owned was bankrolled in the fire
My solar empire surrounded by a dire of fire
Punctuation piranha pariah voice ill like a force field
Looking for Poseidon's pile of dead divers
My squad leader upfront I'm right behind him
He said the eye on the dollar bill tried to blind him
Charge your bolt and get ready for the assault New York
None of you suckers are even remotely close to me
I keep a library of lyrics on microfiche
You can't even absorb the rhymes I record
Or resolve the deep laws of the physics involved
I travel to the end of the universe and beyond
Like crop circles and other unexplained phenomena
Nine out of ten of these rap artists is garbage
Like crack fiends having the Hepatitis B vaccine
Getting busy all over the UK scene
Star buck your ass and take your large Mocha
I tuck heat before I brush the teeth
1 Rocky and 400 Demolition Man soldiers
That are all gonna be paid one of these days
Call the warm line I might spits some bars
But without that I couldn't show you what this shit is about
Perfect poetic masterpiece spit heat
Itch for beats throw I fit go to sleep until my shits released
Miss your status briefing and be quite while I'm speaking
Communication access is locked down
Shark boy gave lava girl an epidural...
I move through the trees without a breeze
Not displacing any of the leafs you are chasing me on your knees
I won't spy for you even if you can see what I'm seeing
The cyclops with dry wax in his ear slots
The beat changes its rhythm they both change their pitch position
I'll make an incision to bring it back to life with a written
You can't rhyme like this unless you rhyming with us
Call the warm line I might spits some bars
But without that I couldn't show you what this shit is about
Perfect poetic masterpiece spit heat
Itch for beats throw I fit go to sleep until my shits released
Miss your status briefing and be quite while I'm speaking
Communication access is locked down
Shark boy gave lava girl an epidural...
I move through the trees without a breeze
Not displacing any of the leafs you are chasing me on your knees
I won't spy for you even if you can see what I'm seeing
The cyclops with dry wax in his ear slots
The beat changes its rhythm they both change their pitch position
I'll make an incision to bring it back to life with a written
You can't rhyme like this unless you rhyming with us
When it was exactly that
Not specifically jams in the park
But when emcees used to talk with advanced thought
Looking forward to not looking back
Rip the Jacker bout to get at you
The cuneiform symbols on my uniform tell you what I been through
Heat it up till the bones blacken
Full Metal Gold Plaque classics
Your chronograph is still in the past tense
Double shot glass of absinthe still spitting fantastic
Before it turn into something somebody gotta bleed about
If I feel the need for speed do not freak out
White phosphorous smoke screen the whole street out
Tell me how you like it
See you've got to understand
I can't work a nine to five
So I'll be gone... till November
Yo I'll be gone till November
Gave my mom a hug for her soul when she cry
With some dark skinned brothers who looked Sicilian
Standing on the block where the spot get hot selling rocks
Guaranteed to get set up by a crooked cop
We raise Hell till the heavens fall
Over a quiet game of billiards
With the power to collapse buildings
Riding across the ocean floor like Poseidon on a seahorse
To reach our overseas tours
Now every time I make a run
Yo I'll be gone till November
Guaranteed to get set up by a crooked cop
You ain't invincible all we gotta do is get pissed at you
Point you out to some people that'll physically injure you
See you've got to understand
I can't work a 9 to 5
It just goes to another place and happens again
Till it sound like you cock semi back
That son of a bitch came from somebody's daughter
I want him caught before tomorrow and slaughtered
Hip Hop's long lost father
Take the laser beam gun off the gun charger
Hold Hip Hop for hostage in the hottest box on the continent
The Ghana apartment complex
But you ain't the only master
So I hope you enjoy your assignment
Then explode into all violence
Group Home is the name of my organization
I rock ice bigger than boulders
I'm a threat to National Security
But you'll be fine after average recovery time
Breast plates move when I give chase
You gonna have to face the champ
My sword is honed from Red Dragon's rib bones
If the target ever stands in one spot
Then place you in a bathtub of carrion beetles
Since you want that I give you what I got
Soldiers do what they have to
I sing it to myself till I fall asleep
There's been a sniper on the loose for a week
Where for art thou noble emcee
My belief is anything with teeth got the right to eat
When the jeeps on the strip pussy meet dick
Satellites watch me they think they got me
Right hands turn left shoulders around but it's not me
In hotels my cloak drag across the lobby
Pick the beat up on my back my knees crack
Scatter raps across the map
Lodge members don't attempt to announce my name
Rip your carburetor out your car and chase you
You'll never want that to go down
Attached to my van on Utica
3-60 deal means you getting circle by a shark boy
Don't let the alcohol fuck with your short vision
I wrote this rhyme in five minutes
It's like you on Twitter with nobody to talk to
You never had enough rhymes to fuck with mines
For no formidable fights I've been formed to forget
Focus upon the facts that facts can be fabricated to form lies
Make the whole world feel us
From the crack to the cap peelers
The desk of any redneck record exec
On a screen a man exposes his breasts wit no penis
Yo yo I feel like I'm one of the livest
And I plan to graduate with honors
Looking at our label's roster wondering how the fuck they forgot us
After we done recorded dozens of albums
With the potency of a scorpion sting to the throat
Overdose that's extremely fatal
Doctors in white lab coats scramble for an antidote to save you
Your whole room is full of angels
All in your ear trying to tell you which God you should pray to
You're paralyzed on the operating table
For the Brotherhood to shine
For any and all who wanna rhyme
For any and all who wanna rhyme
For the Brotherhood to shine
For any and all who wanna rhyme
I've battled emcees for ten years straight
You tried to skin graft but can't replace
10,000 Bars nobody can keep that pace
Or counteract my Sharpshooter attack
My utility belts stack with Pro Tools and tracks
To show them the coat of arms and the lines of the rhymes
Calling all Rippers with Lyrical Fitness
That's the reason why I rhyme like no man
My ears back engineer the sound they hear
I don't give a... they bleed just like us
Metronome Man is going to line you up
But I just wanna wet my beak with these bitches
Then revived beneath the surface of the petrified crimes
Create groans from bones in the taxidermy department
Hip Hop's vet may be Hip Hop's best
I'm two stories up in the Palomar Observatory
Some of them have learned to ignore me
Right before the Armageddon happens
You waiting for the news to report it
Military jargon frogmen laced the target
Disengage the rally point and bomb it
Channel 7 said I was dead in Yemen
I dark skinned man approached the command post
Colorado Springs in the Vandenberg Welcome Center
Pack flotations for giant wave formations
I've got the grid location of the fallout
Is hard to lip sync even when you know
Laser guided star tactic optics
Listen to the rhyme you can tell when it's not Bis
I rhyme like this in a benign climate
Let me welcome you to a panoramic view
Of what we about to sell you
I'm probably what you would call a
Record industry population enforcer
In order to keep this shit in order
I always stay focused the longest
I promise I can battle any artist till they just get exhausted and forfeit
Now I got some banging ass beats now
I've been accused of being all hype
Every night I got into a bar fight
Must have been a typo
The type of shit I be spitting
For all the enthusiasts that love my music
With microprocessors submerged in cryogenic fluids
Because I know where you live
And I got the address to your crib
Spitting some wicked ass lyrics
Get the fuck out the way before The Horsemen stalk
We headless motherfuckers and we lacerate
Get the fuck out the way before The Horsemen stalk
We headless motherfuckers and we lacerate
Voodoo curse brought back The Horsemen from the grave
Four headless motherfuckers that'll clap at the gate
Dogs don't associate with cats
If time could rewind I would have rewound before
I'm the one that started off extortion
Featherweights came with the enforcements
And I take my time when I take my money
I'm always careful when I make my money
But The Horsemen here though
Like the over fiend ET with VD
We the glitch in The Matrix
Temporarily trade places
Take linear time and bend it
We bend blocks with big shots
And kill your little homey like Kid Rock's
You're gonna get your ass stampeded repeatedly
Please believe what you see
Or see it to believe it
So fresh and so clean this
Use a dull blade and sever ya neck
You're whack because I say so
With your manicured hands and gay flows
I murder your first born after it's only a day old
Then gallop over ya body with a horse and carriage
Pass the pussy to Priest and let him stab it
And we all got a bone to pick
Go to war with them like the Bosnians and Bolsheviks
Put an umbrella up they asshole and open it
Now I got a formula that's guaranteed to work
With more knowledge than the Druids and the will power to do it
My first name's Jermaine so my heart probably pumps Germanium
You can witness my body beamed up by aliens
I remember the first war
The way the sky burned
The faces of angels destroyed
I saw a third of Heaven's legion vanished
And the creation of Hell
I stood with my brothers and watched Lucifer fall
But now my brothers are not brothers
And we have come here where we are mortal
Yo when the intercourse starts commencing
They wont even notice the sexual harassment
There's only two reasons a girl would leave me for the next one
Never had a bed I couldn't find a female occupant for
I will ooze lyrical exactitude from your bitches boobs
To prove good things comes in two's
I refuse to lose I lost and paid more dues
So 9 times out of 10 I'm in a confused mood
They listen to my shit
But what is the dynamics of the relationship
So many stressful thoughts
My heart wants to take me to court
So many scars all over the god
Nobody move nobody nod
Your body is a casualty of war
Above the fangs and the horns
That's where the halo is worn
That slaughterhouse joined
Real kings recognize real kings
I don't care about the ring
I'm one quarter horsemen
My horse jaws flying saucers
The horses talk about slaughter
Double shot dose of karma
I ride bare chest they wear armor
We will strike at dawn father
And meet you back at the altar
Before the daylight wanders
And the crescent moon changes my conduct
I come back covered in dog blood
Fall back slaughter rap
Fire crossbow off horseback
Complete the whole course and all that
Follow dog paw prints in the snow
Find where the prince keeps the hawk at
Carrier ship whale guns impale you bums
With nails that weigh tons
And feels like a blunt sponge
Crush crystal to crumbs
Still spitting with a tumor for a tongue
The fat man silences the slut
The horse gallops to the rhythm of the drum
Come through like yeah
Beijing all up in the beer
Horses in armor everybody scared
The gods have appeared and you not prepared
You had lots of chances not one was fair
The sound of compressed air in your ears are here
In the same hemisphere is clear
The supper came all the way from Sweden
That's a real long way to go just for something to get eaten
Better make sure you decent
Prepare food bring the beast in
Seat them over here I wanna see everything
Lights start to dim go to auxiliary power
Somebody get over here and talk to him
I bleed all over their hands and still spit what I wrote
An irreversible plague the scourge of a soon coming age
You are wise not to number your days
The irreversible plague you know my name
Who the fuck want what with Trauma
Diamond sharp tooth piranhas jaundice eyeballs out of Ghana
Weapons cache at the Desert Inn
10 confirmed kills on a bad day
Make a Frisbee out ya album
A jam that you love but don't be getting no airplay
Strictly for stunting when you riding around
This is strictly for stunting when you riding around
They auditioning for the wrong part
Like a mosquito bite in the dark
Subsequent to the usage of such applied techniques
Lyrical law behind the beacon of thought
I'm like Igor with eagle claws ripping meat off
The barrel of the shotgun bigger than a beer mug
In the struggle for survival brothers become rivals
Mothers become homicidal cussing at the bible
Universal personal trainer for lyrical fitness
I'm here to observe you not hurt you
The greater and the lesser can only become better by working together
You'll find this out in your first semester
Delineating what is invading from what is escaping
Solutions for saving Hip Hop that are still in the making
As soon as I stop talking I stop producing carbon
Spitting indigenous verses for medicinal purposes
Ammonia distilled from dung fills in my lungs
Take water from Jordan river and share it with rippers
Now all you respect me because I'm a threat
You sleeping and you slept till you see infrared
Now when the gun starts you hope for my set
You should be worried because I'm coming for your neck
Garrison personnel up in the Hamburger Hill Hotel
I'm in the backyard shooting beer bottles off bricks
Mercenaries on some militant shit
With a bellowed shell and gun claps
Run through Hell with hunchbacks
In ripped jeans and chains I'm a slave to the rhythm
Heavyweight hardware bruises and wrist furs
South African in the Vatican getting arrogant
Don't say a fucking word to me just nod
Translate the text I throw scrolls you fetch
My style is not even something unknown yet
That where the tape ends but a new loop begins
I can't believe what they do for ends
I tuck heat before I brush the street
1 Rocky and 400 million man soldiers
Drinks animal blood from my black bowl then lash from the throat
The fastest will be the last to go
Sky watches record the speech of the jaguar priest
Rapid fire some lyrics like Big Pun spitting
Like the time I sat there and watched him eat eight chickens
The Horse gonna put you on the stretcher
Combined with a beast from the east...
Buried his head in the sand to plant some land mines
Instead mankind embrace fags who can't rhyme
Lyrics that fly like bullets when the hammer hit it
You'll catch damages beyond repair
My rhymes smash through the booth window to strike the engineer
I can maintain a threshold for pain
And change the position of your brain
I'll scalp you like the Indians on horseback
Running bull will hit you harder than running back
Stunning man with brave and cunning raps
Heads is flipping like acrobats on gym mats
I transmit images over the distance
Those who hear my efforts got to give me the merit
Off lyrics alone I'm a legend
It's the way I put it together
People forget but the history will remember
Let the records show I resisted under the pressure
My short but precise endeavor to raise the measure
That's what I see when I look in the mirror
Regardless of whether I'm not a bestseller
The literal literature ripper
Painting pictures for intelligent listeners
From any and all dispositions
The intellectual division of science and religion
People waste their momentum trying to defend it
I could fix the way they look at the world
They read all these books in a barrel but they can't think for themselves
Must be strong because no one ever helps Germaine
Observe the whole world's pain
And tell me you ain't tired of praying
The Catholic faith will never be the same
You can be put in chains because you've got a Muslim name
Sent to Guantanamo Bay and tortured for days
These rats in the corporate race is fakes
Nobody ever gives you what they didn't already take
I mimic haters like flight simulators in air bases
Recovered from an inverted spin and now I'm famous
Those who respond to Rip the Jacker with hate
Show poor taste and only exacerbate their fate
Out of long black sleeves with skeleton hands
Turn rappers back into clay
My mind's a museum filled with microphone exhibits
Slowly chose the dark side for ice cold forties
So tell me what the hell am I suppose to do
The reset button is coming and some of us love it
Of herbal delight with no personal life
Terrifying like Saddam allegiance
But I think you're looking too closely
You walk in and get read like articles
If you ever wanna see me
My eyes chase light waves through time and space
What the fuck can be inside a diamond case
The light bearer the golden era joint task
When the EKG go silent
And I want to thank this brother
For inviting me to be a part of this project
And it is music the way I love music
Kinda reminds me of when you
And listen to the same songs
And I want to thank this brother
For inviting me to be a part of this project
And it is music the way I love music
Kinda reminds me of when you
And listen to the same songs
This goes out to the motherfucker that stole my rhyme book
Let me tell ya what design you took
Ya got a piece of batch 14 article 3
I hope you have a good time it's a remarkable read
It can make you marketable indeed
You now got ya hands on the secrets of a master MC
Personalized print extra wide script so my eyes don't squint
My mind thinks smoke rise through the vent
Try to rework the theory but the logic is thin
You could duck a swing I spit webs duck one of them
My fingerprints on your soul when I touch a pen
We interact when you memorize the raps
Identify that syntax applied with stats
When I open my mouth it's like sliding back the bolt
No joke leave a hole in you was an insult
You better check the wind direction when I talk
Before and after somewhere in between I blast ya
Rhymes on deck check the chart specs
I'm the greatest scientifically inclined mind since Einstein
I write blue ribbon rhymes for Nobel prize time
Trying to shine with the shit I invent
Which means I represent and get deep in thoughts
With philosophies like a rolling stone gathers no moss
Fucking with me you'll catch a free round trip to the morgue
With the knowledge of my forefathers
The intellectual athlete accurately rapping so rapidly
Yet he makes perfect sense mathematically
I happily accept any rapper's offer to challenge me
Fifty emcees reduced to forty nine casualties
I'll be the last man standing
With metaphors a Charlie Horse couldn't put a cramp in
One hundred parts per million per civilian
First inoculate the women and inoculate the children
I showcase the quotes that the alien wrote
In less time than it take to write these words
I scream out the end of the Earth but nobody heard
My black goggles covered with bat guano
Flesh wound look like marmalade mushrooms
Tattoo absorb ink drawn from King Nimrod
Sales of street polymer gels that form hardened shells that repel
Interrogative drills in the torture cell
Cutting me up with glitter covered gloves
They ask questions with Russian like aggression
Space grunts line up face front
We low crawl paying no attention to our nose at all
I see the beast pupil size increase
Zero in where the chest and the neck intersect
Cardboard papers signs
I mount my weapon like I mount my women
If I like it let's meet next week
Nobody here really knows...
Base Jump over the cliff hanger
Infinitesimal potential of human mental
Entombed with views that are central
Universally acceptable and generally sensible
The general of hip hop sentinels
It all goes back to your thoughts
Jamal told me when I was small
My intelligence was odd
I didn't understand nothing at all
For the most part I still don't
Still get busy for real though
I'm looking forward to them big boy toys
Icebreaker bow and kill
Magnum roof sales for volcanic spills
The intuition is real
So is the inquisition of the purchase from the hills
My stimulus package is lyrical
With the drum magazine that looked like a truck wheel
So just do what I tell you when I talk
Even if I'm by myself in my room
Come back when you got rap mastered
We can perceive anything
My body is ground based
My soul is probably in outer space
Go hard in the paint till I faint
The reality they create would not let them escape
Backpack a mental metal
The singularity sentinel sent through the Stargate bezel
Made a crystal to tell you
They restrain you because they fear you
Remember the letter I wrote
Before Atlanta on Up In Smoke
That's the day I was gonna cut ya throat
I seen my watch was twelve hours late and I missed the show
But none the less I'm glad that I finally reached you
Ever since the accident I've been dying to speak to you
To tell you things have changed
And I'm a different man
A different level of understanding
Things are a lot better
I meant we should start a group
The industry's full of homosexuals Slim
But I don't wanna touch you
I just wanted you to recognize I got talent too
I Just Wished You Cared
They did some tests on me at NIH in Maryland
They showed me techniques to help me deal with pressure
Whenever I remembered that crazy night when I was being reckless
On the bridge and I crashed into a Lexus
Right before I finished that last sentence
The next thing I knew I was under water and breathless
I was unconscious for a second
Literally dying to go to heaven
Till some fellas came and pulled me from the wreckage
By the time the car sunk
My pregnant girlfriend was still in the trunk
The ambulance came and they put me on the stretcher
Hooked me up to the IV and checked my blood pressure
One of them was so concerned that they wouldn't leave
He hopped in the back of the ambulance and rolled up some trees
I just remember his voice talking to me
In the emergency room
I needed surgery to get some glass removed
And fifty stitches for my wounds
After a couple months of therapy
I figured I was as ready as I'd ever be
I wanted to be an emcee
He took me to shows wit him
He let me flow wit him
He let me write some rhymes and go on tour wit him
I really believed in him
I decided to team wit him
He introduces me to people as his lyrical equal
Let me write a rhyme on his album and even produce a beat too
He's not the type to call you just because he needs something
That's what I like about him
You see there's a little bit of Stan in all of us
Tell me where you think all of these record sales spawn from
They say... that Rick Rick is...
You don't want death to walk her
Put you and your family on welfare
The eyes and spare a few assholes lives
It's no such thing as challenging the Slickest
Wish they could give motherfucker some pussy
Never see another human being this greatness
Unless frame interest dame
Let's name who the king piece in the chess game
You're dressed like a mountain man mixed with Tarzan
Connected to a relatively small man
Park next to rocky the rams dark van
Better be able to understand what comes from that
Your family won't even get no insurance back
The poor always walk to the back of wherever they at
Unless they went there to rap
Camera snap not even as fast as the phantom attacks
The camera flash is not even as fast as that
Nobody cannot pirate this when Bis spit it
Nobody cannot tell me about music business
If you love Hip Hop then join me
Mr Chaos rip the beat for La Street
That I am not free and neither are you
The only time I feel free is when I'm rhyming in the booth
The lion on the loose is not a reckless recluse
But really a dictator with his neck in a noose
That enjoyed the dark matter in the void before time
They let the serpent in but it never occurred to them
The deity regards emcees like me piously
On planet Earth I designed mankind's rebirth
Amalgam of water and rock salt from a verse
Not the original but man's imitation of it
They took Hip Hop and changed the subject
Then I brought Hip Hop back and made you love it
Bend it through telepathic suggestion
Occurs intermittently over protracted periods
This is called hard jawbreaker labor
We gonna dogfight above cloud cover
Ages have ended and ages have begun
My ribcage look like miniature shin blades
When I bathe in the waters below
Man only respects God's energy
30 seconds and I'm out the door man
A tally written up when I bust the flow man
It's all about devotion
Try to reconcile you ain't want me back
30 seconds and I'm out the door man
A tally written up when I bust the flow man
They issue the order not to come near me no matter how bad I sound when they hear me
The bolts in your skull smoke from the Frankenstein flow
When the song disconnect your right through your left
You can't bring clicks to this game
My sick sentences cut you down with a quickness
Gaze into my crystal ball bitch bear witness
Eat your skull like a Concord grape that taste great
Eat your heart like strawberries off a cheesecake
Rip the Reptile escape before his release date
He go crazy if you talk about something he hate
The eagle face watches from above the clouds
Indigenous images with ancient depictions of futuristic missions
Dualism diminishes through cognitive dissonance
And Enoch and sacred geometry
The modern day Nikola Tesla
North American union is imminent
This rag's for scrubbing your asshole not mine
For the last time your the asshole in my rhymes
I'm a thirty thousand foot ocean wave snatching planes out the sky
Fuck the day Tesla discovered the Death Ray
He spit 33 rhymes in one place
The sound of my voice come from the core of my chest
Room tempt so cold it is hot
Whatever it takes to make you rhyme less
But I was scorn by a society of preliterate degenerates
Fuck you for giving him the Grammy
Face recognition hardware zoom
When you fools gonna learn
The Aristotle models configure to model hell
Sound cracks the outer space transmission
The integration only come from divine intervention
The similar mission only in post beta phase
The mental energy will turn it into stellar waves
I hear the tones of consciousness I wake up and try to explain
The constellations still rotating with this sentence
The choppers are being played to blaze weight
I just think it's highly motherfucking improbable
I could kick a rhyme longer than your whole album
From 12 am to 12 pm in the evening
I got cast out of heaven for treason
A whole legion of half decent emcees get released when
They spit a hundred bars for they freedom
See I'm much too nice to compete wit
And start to punch trees till they leafless
The drive comes from my lyrics and my lyrics come from my inner spirit
Fast enough to give your brain an aneurysm
Show me a man that can't feel him
I'll show you a man that'll grab him by the neck
And put his head to the fan on the ceiling
Suffer real bad from television shit
Drop him off the roof of a building and let the news film him
Ninety percent of the shit that rappers give is subject matter less
Got a infrared blaster to test your body's Fahrenheit
I track you till you're seizure grows into a afro
Track you till your shoe soles develop holes
Till your teeth develop hollow coses
You better bring an ice pack when I see you in person
Break necks without breaking a sweat
One day we gonna see who's the better emcee
What a tangled web you weave
Couldn't tell you what wasn't on his mind
Internet snitching like a little bitch
Got bust in the eyesight and still wouldn't fight
My rap refracts the rhythm
The beats stays behind this line until I give them permission
She left me a message
She told me my dark energy was energetic and I must respect it
She told me the Universe was pregnant and I was the father
Shit that's a whole lot to swallow
My two inch reels are hermetically sealed
Deep underground military base too
Light from within touch the ring around the firing pin
The Universal Mind is wired in
A hundred grid bed nuclear motors
Doors to the memoirs of metaphors
Leads you down a hall on that ends in a waterfall
Just left the confession box my Lord
Close circuit security level four
My cranium is an aquarium with fish
My compact disc make your compact glitch
I sit on a throne of mastodon bones
Arms fold into bar codes while programs probe the unknown mold of the old
Scouts dismount search hideouts from the south
I know the supply routes inside out
Rotate to one that's fake long enough to run to the base
My safe zone is a space dome
USA made mold brain insulated with foam
Strike a fire in sidewinders
Forced to retire from my roll over priors
And if he can't bring it back send Rip
Beats bang you in the head till it's bent and dented
Spit a sentence too endless to defend against it
One entrance no exit through the barbwire trenches
They might check it like they want my attention
Activate all of your senses creating the template
The rhyme is inside your mind behind eyelids
The robot prophet with IR Optics
The fourth leg was fractured by a nine degree angle
If it's alive and it writes rhymes I can kill it
The goddamn truth this ain't nothing to dance to
While the Son of Sam prepares for war
My hands form ram horns
Daddy ain't to shabby he rarely rhymes badly
Better holster that weapon when you walk in this direction
Pull a rhyme out the burlap and murder your raps
The cowboy going to church with a curve in his hat
Get born again to go to war again
Hip Hop must not fall again
And God don't love you so he ain't gonna judge you
Me and my man Com Sense
I'm bout to make the name Com Sense a name you fear
Like a broken hearted bitch
Move crowds with kinetic wisdom
I'm bad to the bone marrow
The Earth got one sun but I walk with three shadows
I write twice and drop singles in record pools
The click that you came in with accent your flavor wit
Far more advanced than a rapper who's career
Amongst hard working teachers and corrupt preachers
In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses
You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence
I'm cold with numb intentions
With 360 degree visual
My face don't belong in The Source
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
I'll blow you to ashes with tactics
People know who you are
Now I got mad shorties that wanna call me
Bring it bag to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave.
Let your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab
It's time I made the name Com Sense a name y'all fear
Since I made the name Com Sense a name y'all fear
In Iraq with his own Thug Paradise block
With a logo that resembles the masters scar
Vertical flight with submersible glowing lights
I got the green light...
This was specifically written for you
Like the policy payments of a hospital patient
The homicidal rhymes that your mind made up
Grab the pad and write while I talk to the lab mice
I huff and puff and blow down the booth
Spit like a beast then I spiritual fast for two weeks
The eyeball of Odin recording every movement and moment
Ain't gonna spend much time talking
Just gonna get right into it
Underground manure rap from the sewer rat
Captured tagged released the microphone Beast from the East
Over Marco Polo beats I black out the Baa Baa Black Sheep
What you gonna do when you meet an emcee just like you
This is what is to be expected with no direction
A probe was sent to get an answer for a question in a scripted sentence
Not to mention what ever I recommended before the verse ended
Worth their own weight in gold in the game
Lord Finesse in the flesh spit a bar per request
I feel as if everything I've learned
Has made be obsolete before I could even say one word
What I said it not what you heard or what you thought you observed
The vision is getting blurred but you have to be sure
What does it feel like to be a rap legend
They got beef but they don't got no trigger time in the street
Walk around all angry looking for some answers
Just some nobodies barely nobody knows
About a thousand years old with a potty mouth flow
Out here trying to promote this album
I thought Hip Hop was the language of many nations
A chance at exploration not exploitation
Then I proceed to battle Hell boy's man
My father was bitten by a poisonous snake in Guyana
He was treated by Birmingham's doctor
That's where I learned to play soccer
Grateful and relieved about what has been achieved
Not scornful with desires and unabated greed
Even the uneducated seed can agree
That modern day emcees is not like they used to be
In the background you see a Brown Dwarf on the drums
Hip Hop is restored through Lyrical Law
He claimed that he'd written the greatest rhyme of all time
And NOW is the time to take it out the archives
Atlantis was only one planetary base
The national reconnaissance guys are disguised
Served to me on gold trays
Always with a bird on those days
Bow before what the Great Light brings
Death to any and all who disrespect Lyrical Law
That's the main motor jaw protocol
It's just changed so much that it's not
Let's not go through that again
But I'm the only one they can trust
I called because I had to tell you
What to do when your resources fail you
My job is to preserve yours and my future
I got mustard wings the odd way
From a bowl shaped like Skull and Bones
I'll pour wine to shorten the foreplay time
I proposed it was best she didn't know
Special collection service track down every beat purchased
Researchers read my incomplete verses
My heartbeat ends when the Devil and God become friends
Crisis situation in the bodega
Gun bolt long as a trombone
Everybody leave your body armor at the door
I find time to regroup and switch suits
And everybody else know it too
Looks like we got us a tweaker
With incompetent psycho content
Combination's of other moves can lift the soul
The vibratory frequency completely related to human decency
Life is what you believe it to be
I don't freestyle for keyboard crowds
The masses will never understand the rhymes I said
Get over your feelings of false security
Before you bleed burgundy
Repent before the Goddess of Purity
She says she knows somebody that can work with me
Put me in the mood to brainstorm
All my loved ones hold hands and sing songs
Synchronized time on my signal
They got a picture of me on they Code of Arms
The Mountain man's hand are colder than oil pans
From disloyal fans that wanna spoil the whole plan
It doesn't matter if he get caught
They chased him so far now you lost
It ain't about 16 bars you bought
No matter what you or you or you or you
Imagine every human being in fatigues
Solitude in the life of a Ripper is quite bitter
I am exactly the way I was made
Even when I change lyrical content still bangs
Can't wait to hear what you spit over this
Then I burn this shit down from the ground to the roof
Radiantly we will be inside that mind
Jedi Mind third eye will identify the force that binds
Force of the rhymes will turn on solar signs
My family come through
Power moves to be made
But those that try to bind me
Right behind me wit my members
Caught up in the game black can't explain that
But longevity that's what I aim at
You wanna come through
Kid I go the shit that pray the rams plus the bills
For from the east to the west
LP all of LB now who's the best
Break your wins down like a pronoun
I'm that guy land of the lost
Is enough to make the reels on cassette tapes bust
Cause none of you fools is capable
Rhymes ricochet off the inner walls of my lungs
To past the tongue faster then bullets come out of guns
Who wants to be the one to get struck first
I bury they body on any planet except the earth
Kid nobody else smokes more then my team
You can't harm me even if lip was froze
Get incinerated from verbal inferno
Born created get physical castrated
I'm so glad I made in a world where I'm hated
Time after time I beat the hell out of a track
Most definitely I gets busy when we attack
Be on some ill type streets raps from way back
As a child I got wilder styles
I used to shine all day and a rocked the crowd
So get tell me I'll come around
So fasten your seat belt and see a hornets trip
Always had this gift as a child to write poetry
If I cough in my fist when I open my hand
The iron clad nomad my flow smash rip up the whole jam
When I leave the audience hold hands
Hand ya face back to you pleasantly
Or make me pull up on a moped
Its hard to see the white meat after I hot sauce him
Strap the visor gold with it
Yo yo now now now now
When I wake up before I gather up my pens
I shine up my fronts I give a Dutch for all my mens
Throw on some Marvin Gaye
I smoke my weed and clean my kitchen dishes
It's time for me here to prepare my caper
I written it down the line and now a ring is on my phone
Yo I got the liquor the grain fool let's make a tape
I'm caught up in my own zone can't really escape
I ran it down the line as Easy Mo played the song
He checked my five he said to me yo later on
I got the bike that I copped from my younger cousin
Cause that cat is up in class like a nickel and he wasn't
See my man Pop or Die from the block
See certain situations happen
We used to have each other's back
Walked to the back now let me get a four
Exit from the spot everybody know what's hot
The thieves turn the block
As Mama Blackwell whispered
He represents my Crew
You represent my Crew
He represents my Crew
You represent my Crew
Yo represent yours Crew
Get crushed by the stampede of the elephant tusks
You got a problem I got the answer
Had the blackboard with the chalk in my hand
Watched the crowd get amped
While they scream and chant
It's ill hot they can't keep still like a fire drill
We desire mils from 97 until
Group Home is my Crew
It's worldwide my Crew
Strictly out for the fortune and fame
I entertain for my personal gain
Big enough to cause neck pains
I be the last one to set it
You could find my name
If you open up and look at the cover
And we all represent the Group Home click
And as the clock ticks record sales climb
For hard work produces results
Somebody stops my pulse
The whole World my Crew
I smoke trees with my...
Naturally Born to rip these bars
You a monster with the lyrical law
I flow real as Captain Cold Crush give you the shivers
Elixirs from an alchemist chemistry fission
Bringing some muscle flash lyrics
In spite of my dark visions in a dark room used for developing pictures
Spit a sentence to silence the Heavens
College credit students acknowledge my message
Elixirs from an alchemist chemistry fission
Bringing some muscle flash lyrics
In spite of my dog visions in a dark room used for developing pictures
Spit a sentence to silence the Heavens
A guilty smiling inspiration for every living derivative of human nature
Tools I use to take it to back to school
I save struggled rap by the bell
I wrote it's name on a cartridge with a thousand shells
Gold bars from King Midas come in all sizes
The borders are private when ten thousand bars are united
Cooking hash browns and grits
My Marines piss on emcees
Got sawed in half by a psychopath SAW gunner
Dirty Harry's my brother and I'm his ugly cousin
Scarecrow skinny but still get busy
If ripping beats is a crime I'm guilty
After one solid attempt I polish the end
The Event Horizon event
My style is not even something unknown yet
The crew drink buccaneer brew
The hawk's tooth is proof of what I might do
We hire soldiers to blow you up with high explosives
Make sure that you die in focus
Might have enriched plutonium in three days
The intellectual festival rhyme incredible
Rhymes stand at attention till I tell them to chill
Stand on the ledge of the hill
They kill who I tell them to kill
I give conjugal visits to my own lyrics
Fuck what the beat sounds like the poem fits it
I'm just dumbing it down for a minute
The hotel Hanoi decoy with a deep voice
I put some water on the kettle for tea
I can commit psychic assassination from brain entrainment
Communication through short wave
My headquarters enclave is a dark cave not far away
Central headquarters on the corner of four borders
Rich vegetation resources and clean water
Get close to the ground to detect the direction of sound
I take a second to inspect my rounds
So I ain't got time to get at you
I went to bastard school to learn how to harass you fools
And to turn swamp gas to fuel
The first shall be last and the last shall be cruel
I melt the polar icecaps to slush
Synchronize brainwaves heartbeats and hormone production
Western civilization completely missed it
Transparency is key to the truth
The underground bunker buster proof
My stimulus package is lyrical
With the drum magazine that looked like a truck wheel
So just do what I tell you when I talk
How much can you matter if you are not infinite
Even if I'm by myself in my room
Come back when you got rap mastered
This the type of jam that be getting no airplay
This the type of jam that be getting no airplay
When we commercialize it's to enterprise
We guarantee to sell a hundred mil before we die
Yo this the type of jam that be getting no airplay
This the type of jam that be getting no airplay
My tongue moves much faster than yours do
I practice lyrical witchcraft on your bitch ass
There will be no sequel to this revolution
The people versus gestapo
But I need chips so I can reinvest in a whip
Then I'll add another six cylinders to my V six
Spitting game you can't rebel
Like all I want to do is get in their drawers
Step on stage and pace left to right
More lines to your forehead than Brian McKnight
Since you're iced out you can keep the swelling down
Let him down he's a Mic Club member now
Like motherfuckers give me 50 bars right now
Tell the queen of the pride to come sit on my lap
Protected by the Mic Club security advises
The lyrical linguist spitting vintage colonial English
This is a new season with new rhymes for the same reason
The public needs it but without faith they won't believe it
It's connected to our spiritual ascension
Obey the law with its fundamentally flawed components
Your rhymes are far from impressive
You got me snoring and I'm not even a narcoleptic
I gotta give you credit
I used to collect them and I see the resemblance
I'll give you ten cents for every time you spit ten bars
But kept moving state to state
Crazier than a Hollywood actor would act on coke
I wouldn't share the spotlight with anybody but him
We open the can of big bang theory all over again
As deadly as a cobra fang puncturing your blood vein
Or Mad Max behind the wheel of a Mustang
Puffing a hundred and twenty nine octane
Armed to the teeth like tanks in Iran
Driving like Terminator two through block lanes
After the autopsy they'll just pull out your brain
Put it in a jar you probably won't feel a thing
This rap industry is such a morbid thing
Why would you want to rap forever and earn nothing
I rap like the end of the earth is coming
Watch me change through my fits of rage
When the turrets syndrome phase is engaged
I attract the gaze of a million eyes transfixed on stage
Concentrate get your mind right
I hear them voices but the vision is missing
Telling me to put my fist in but I won't listen
I rare species of EMCEE
Lay your hand on the middle of your forehead and show you what I mean
You never seen the best before
This one's about a family in Kabul
That was killed when a shell from the sky had bombed their school
Waiting for the book to go to print soon
Climbing the pyramid two blocks at a time
The wolf has no constituent need to bark back
Rocket propelled bars from a Alaska's largest national park
Where helicopters crash in the dark
You are reading what I'm seeing
The old man on the mountain from New Hampshire
He possess all knowledge known
Something that we understand naturally
In America hearts and minds start to backslide
Especially if your spouse in unattractive
Look at all these mother fucking biters going pop
You'll be Dead by Design by the time the album drops
And no body gives a fuck what the album is about
If the heart desires nothing you will not experience suffering
They got beef but they don't got no trigger time in the street
Walk around all angry looking for some answers
Just some nobodies barely nobody knows
About a thousand years old with a potty mouth flow
A Senator can't walk like a thug from Harlem
Drawing designs for my starship
A stream of vomit pours out of my nose
I make buffalo wings out of buffalo hides
In the form of rhymes I will warn you one time
Just to ask you what the fuck is the matter with you
But other than that you a motherfucking fool
That's how we settle it right
Otherwise you can suck my dick and eat shit
What you talking about Willis you ain't no lyricist
I'm the only one that's not paying attention
You never put an album out but you quitting
Took it so far the blue marks are still where I used to sit
Undisturbed unheard of structures under the Earth
I know what I wanna say and what I want from the verse
I make your weak crew release stool
Don't even talk about guns
Because anything that can't penetrate ricochets
You might as well had died and went to hell instead of heaven
In this profession I get busy without a question
Seeing me is like seeing a vampires reflection
Fast or slow flows connect like electrodes
Explode leaving areas abandoned
Says you used to grab your ankles in jail for all the convicts
On a tropical island in the Bahamas
Trying to win a bikini contest
Them skeletons in your closet got flesh on them and they smell rotten
In Cape Canaveral with me in the astronaut capsule
Ready to turn your whole face into sirloin steak
Comparable to questions the Bible
A Congo in this concrete jungle
Pull out your tonsils and stomp you into the Earth like fossils
I'm the meanest master of the ceremony on this whole team
And I can kill anything if it bleeds or breathes
Rapping is a raw business
Put me in the same category you would put Marilyn Manson in
Bugging like a satanic evangelist
Jogging butt naked down Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles
Every emcee in your crew will get ruined or wounded
Spent so much time in the studio I had to move in
I can drink the poison from a king cobra
Cause long after y'all are dead and gone
I survive the nuclear holocaust like a roach arthropod
Tell them how you train even when you on leave
Yo bis I train between spotlights and where the toes tip
I'm the young vet hungry for next peep the pressure build
In memory of old burial hill
What the kid gut under his belt
The more you sweat in practice the less you bleed in war
I'm the best that ever done it to somebody that did it
Meditate at it till your eyes redden
Binary bar stars make me rap
You only a fool when you in the presence of me
Pick the hydrophone up and talk
Y'all don't want Bis to attack
The more metaphors the merrier
Black holes coalesce when I tear through the light
Yeah funky times 4 is funky you know
Poppy seed resin send you to Mic Club heaven
God caused these charged particles to collide
You can't take what's already mine
A mental dime in a physical bondage
I read after some questions because I love his answers
November 19th the Mic Club spot check
Can't figure out how the bootleggers got it legged
Try to move ya mouse after I chop ya wrist
A hundred eighty six thousand miles per sec can melt flesh
I'm out on tour with thirty city trips
Every state is like bitches be bulimic for dicks
Smoke the most enormous trees in the rain forest
While the people go insane for us
I pierce a cloud and make it rain on us
Break the equipment and tell the engineer that I ain't paying for it
I freestyle the whole set
Don't give a fuck who you offend you got to fight till the end
If you fuck a groupie chicken when you out on tour
Smoke a little bit of weed with her then fuck her some more
Tell her to bring three friends so you can fuck all four
Almighty God blessed you with a dick and two balls
So if you like to fuck pussy that don't mean that you wrong
Your superstar status don't mean shit to me
Lyrically sucker emcees still get frequency
Camouflaging your needle tracks with some colorful tattoos
Look at the sixty hour shifts I spend with this
So look inside yourself and tell me what you see
I sit on a throne of mastodon bones
Arms fold into bar codes while programs probe the unknown mold of the old
Scouts dismount search hideouts from the south
I know the supply routes inside out
Rotate to one that's fake long enough to run to the base
My safe zone is a space dome
USA made mold brain insulated with foam
Strike a fire in sidewinders
Forced to retire from my roll over priors
That once it hardens it'll be impossible for any life to live in
I pray that once day all slaves will be free
Frankenstein is a living myth in space
The words rhyme scheme forever written in memories
The rhyme mechanic flew to the moon of Jupiter
Space euphoria beyond the bliss
Deep inside you all knew it was this
No voice inside leaves you blind and sick
You wonder why but you choose not to listen to it
Some spend their whole life pretending not to be who they are
The truth is God's thoughts founds within
I don't think you know what you got yourself involved in
Sitting down at the mixing board in my room
Adjusting the focus of the PC computer zoom
One should not assume that furniture moves when I walk in the room
That I'm in a mood for doom
Most emcees tried to clone Infinity
If I am not advanced then how will I be
With these lyrics I dig many graves
My enemies will forever remain slaves
But it's not just for the youth
Smoking till my lips go black
I am still God of The Brotherhood regime
Mr. Bis which version is this
I wrote the greatest rhyme of all time
And finally I took it out of my archives
A human being is obviously not anybodies property
The nuclear biological chemical mix with mercury
I think you should say what you feel
The gold Geneva swordsman prototype will destroy normal life
I am still the number one
This is a 1000 Bar message from the real Iron Lungs
The chain of command will continue to expand
Phase 1 is complete exactly as we planned it
Deep Blue controls everything on this planet
Phase 2 is assembling space weaponry
If you question me you will be destroyed by the energy
A military project code name Sphinx
The Rabbit Hole goes deeper than you think
Activate the latent psychic ability
I think I've had enough of your blacklist registry
I've mastered the Art of Rhyming
Those of weak heart and mind shouldn't even try
The Law of Attraction is attracted to me
One should know thyself before one can know the world
You can see possibly I write poetic prophecy
I wish you could see that he smokes too much weed
You need to be strong for mommy please
Now here's some trees pick off the leaves
I know this sounds scary but hear me
Bar exam script pages of wisdom under the night's white grin
The Jacker speaks with no vision
The Ripper spit with new propulsion system
Locked in prison to explain the lesson
Meditating on the Moon's Sea of Tranquility
I talk to my family with my emcee facility
May whatever the rhymes touch receive infinite visibility
The Bar Warlords will send the code through Infinity
When I'm rhyming like this your mind might shift
Your holy spirit might lift when you open this Light gift
Rippers evolved with great pace into an enlightened space race
Rippers meshing metaphors that reverse ya mother's menopause
And your face forever pause when I wield my metal thoughts
Follow the Third Letter before you get lost forever
He was the greatest rapper of all time
To be remembered as the Dark Skinned Missing Link
1000 Bars be written for everyone
This is high yield Mixing Board wizardry mentally
Send me to hell just gimme my fan mail
My golden vocal ensemble make the globe wobble
I scrub my ass with water on the rag
My hands... Hooked up to both tanks
Come in red bull this is red dog
Senses collected for seven enders
That's why I crawled out the grave
We can rhyme fair and square or fair in the sphere
And they become cancer patients
Take it to a level you can never sustain
Cause compared to me your brain the size of a sand grain
A pain in the ass that got smacked for saying my name
And now you look like an ass in pain
But watch the shit hit the fan when that cat Can pull up
For messing with me or my brethren
And you definitely can't coach perfection
Take a hammer and smash the stone your name was etched in
Then I'll announce that I'm running for the new election
Then death by getting your head severed is an honorable way to end it
I'd be the richest man on the globe
Coming to punish you pigs
Conquest to war and famine.
Violence and punishment of enemies.
The four horsemen of the apocalypse are among the bible's
Most terrifying figures.
With a rusty screwdriver
The fourth horsemen is the most frightening of them all.
I knock the teeth out ya gums and suck the breeze out ya lungs
Hit ya wit a blow your physical frame could never sustain
You'll probably never walk ever again
You'll be scared to leave the club wit us
Follow us into a new era
Whack lyrics and a hot beat makes your song irrelevant
I'm a poet so it takes more than punchlines to move me
He said I was a soldier in lyrical combat
Other people slandered my name but I dodged that
They don't see the missing pieces my thesis provides rap
Cause that's what my master would do if he was asked to
The most lyrical digital streams the world has ever seen
Why you sound so intense when you rap
The airborne attack you can't call off
Breathe exhaust like a horse or a supercharged Mustang Ford
But I can be as quiet as they want me to be
Who gives a FUCK if your ankles is buff
I pick the microphone up and spark the debate
But I don't know if I'm right no more
But I don't know if I'm right no more
You know where you heard it first
For my kids I thank you God
Leave your skeleton in the cemetery
I'm a fiend for this rap thing
Gruff put your soul in a twister
Peace to the players that crush a lot
And got the same transmitted disease your mother got
Being unfaithful with me right before she divorced your pops
I told the bitch to keep the door locked
I attract the gaze of a million eyes transfixed on stage
Better things come to those who chase
The quantum leap of faith into the blind light
I leave your brain naked and nervous
Welcome to infinity composition theory
All content will be communicated clearly
I'm about to show you why they fear me
You see the air in Sumer is ripe with grief and despair
I sacrifice trimmings of hair
While you rhyme lazy as fuck like you just got your dick sucked
Layer to layer I slay ya
How can I create the right sentence to help explain
Put you up against War Machine
The Microphone Fiend on the scene
Laser beam lyrics coming at you with an altered speed
The Altered Beast don't pause for the beat
You pole vault into a wall of defeat
When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame
Some will still remember it was done by Germaine
This rhyme can outlive your whole lifetime
Be waiting for you on the other side when you arrive
You battle from sunrise to off white moonlight
I take you on a journey through the words
To spit like the 100 Bar Beast
The rhyme equity above quota
Sometimes I go over with more bars than the beat goes for
Put blades to your bones like the Autobiography of Kirk Jones
I will be redeemed for the destruction of the Hip Hop regime
For how it was remembered and seen
But tradition demands I be a more primitive man
Spit fire like I drink hot sauce from a drain
When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame
Some will still remember it was done by Germaine
When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame
That's when you know your times up Germaine
Hang you from your nose on a square pole
And a two headed parrot with a desert fatigue beak
Decorate my bitch breasts with bells
The arthropod tentacles controlled by mental vegetables
Spectacles of doom and gloom and sonic booms
Republicans ride brooms around nuclear mushrooms
You are safe from the nuclear fallout
Now you will crawl out into the hands of a monster now
The best emcee turned his launch codes over to me
On my command you will turn the key and we'll see
The maze in those caves are infinite
The aftermath aftershock is a disaster in a box
The satellite showed me your position
The text is a sick rep for Rippers
The leaders have discovered we the sickest and they wanna sit with us
Revolution Ripper movement you can't stop it
I write what some would call marathon songs
The music industry tried to banish long bars
Every week I slaughter seven beats
My title can't be touched nowhere on the street
I hear a lot of emcees speak
Heads up display with a ticker and a pitcher and picture of the Ripper
Neurotransmitters hooked up to his central nervous system
It feeds him the purpose and the vision
Jailbreak but not out of prison
Strapped to a suicide written
Inside my own mind scripting altruistic composition
Anoint them both with Tesla coils if they quoin my rhymes
A very good screen writing skill
My higher self is outside the realm where time is felt
I sit up from upside down while I'm floating around
Listen to the glorious sound
I sit in my cave and count bats
If Hip Hop is dead then what the fuck are you supposed to do
A supreme intelligent being you don't wanna scuff with
That'll cause it to explode if you try to dub it
Military paratroops in camouflage parachutes
With flight suits and boots landing on ya roof
Eliminate the target is the prime objective
With the Hepatitis B vaccine
Navy seal team making chicks scream
Make him suffer dipped in vaginal cream
You ain't worth the paper plates prisoners eat pork on
The devolution I bring is a diagrammatic enigma
This is an epistolary symphony
What I speak its more than deep is bibulous
A politic with any magazine columnist
Rock solid shit like stones in monuments
Through a microscope and a pair of binoculars
Ghetto scholars like me who study street calculus
Utilize every letter of the Arabic alphabet
And touch every part of your body that makes you feel erogenous
I see a revolution in the industry
I see the partition of God's religion
Expert effective mass burial method so well measured
To held balance near impossible trances in the labyrinth
My shield is composed of meteorite stone
My sword is honed from Red Dragons rib bones
The Science and the poor education we've put our faith in
And try not to kill them
I was authorized to take the kill shot for Hip Hop
The passenger crawled out wiping blood from his jaw and his mouth
The cleanup team is five clicks South
Satellite voice recognition every lyric I'm spitting
The Good Shepard conducts surveillance of the sheep well
Separate the males from the females
Quarantine any and all personnel who rebel
Spit rhymes rapid in a zigzag pattern
My hand is a magnet that's attached to a ratchet
We'll discuss in a later briefing
I designed something a thousand times stronger
Father Author Pariah Pauper keep your eye on the Doppler
I don't know what's coming but it's a monster
As I proceed to give you what you need
DNA resonant coding can locate any target when roaming
Let me show you what you been missing
I ain't had a beat mellow like this in a while
Internationally renowned talent
Spit more verses than a couple hundred thousand
The eye in the obelisk is watching our consciousness
Put mask on for oxygen before you try to rhyme like this
Multisyllabic rap savage swinging through the jungles on a vine of language
With divine understanding of God's people and God's planet
Don't worship the satanic and panic
Those who don't understand it will be left stranded
Face down in a sandpit I wait for the riot
I curse and burp like Wyatt Earp
A hundred and eighty days to retire
Once a day we drink Gatorade in the shade
Effective thrust leaves you breathless
In Iraq with his own Thug Paradise block
The Machines have gathered an army and we have a difficult time ahead of us
But if we are to be prepared for it we must first shed our fear of it
I stand here without fear because I remember
I remember that I am hear not because of the path that lies before me
I had to defeat Mr Smith before leaving the Matrix
I teach the youth but the youth refuse to learn
I made divine darts so they grow spiritually
But the squids who threw away my bars offended me
Summoned to the Mixing Board where I'm sharpening my swords
The gods phoned my cell and I will answer your call
And drop steel thoughts like shit from the seagulls
Video film revealed they govern with the Iron Heel
They crush chariot steel to prevent movement of the wheel
They got me running through the fields searching for my last meals
But don't kneel before artists and beg for record deals
They controlling Man with fear but this world's not real
2012 film scenes shifts the blame on the Sun
But they using Tesla beams made in Area 51
Modifying the weather creating global destruction
Population control that's what it's all about
The New World Order that's what it's all about
All weather is modified by the government
All these events that are going on in Australia
And all these floods and earthquakes
Have actually been controlled with Tesla technology
I choke ghosts from my past with a rope made of ether 9 gas
Then I let the evil times pass
But they will put your assassin in shackles
Some spirits are dark and twisted
We all rise and decline above or below that line
And continue to either climb or dive
Kill or be collective mind back at the hive
The mortar shells loosen you up
This is a new season with new rhymes for the same reason
The public needs it but without faith they won't believe it
It's connected to our spiritual ascension
Obey the law with its fundamentally flawed components
No rapper could rap quite like I can
I had to rock to a beat like this to show you
Calling yourself the greatest is something you don't do
You can't rap or act my main man
And every lie you told just added up cause you wasn't man enough
Rape a rapper with a classic from his own masters
There's a rumor going around that I got dropped
200,000 albums sold at 10 dollars a pop
That's 3 million in 3 months so kiss my ass
All these magazines tried to steamroll me to death
See when you was making records like I need love
Plus I heard Simone was the high school slut
And she learned how to fuck before she knew how to cuss
You married a slut and had kids with her to cover up your hustle
You and your man Russell made a better couple
Your being watched even when you take a dump
The chairs at your label got ears and the walls got eyes
Your living one big lie the world just don't know
You take a polygraph test that shit would probably explode
The Greatest Liar Of All Time that cannot rhyme
That cannot shine as long as I'm alive
And that microphone on your arm will always be mine
Now you're in a world where the hunter becomes the hunted
And somebody keeps paging you putting 4321 in
You can't sleep at night thinking about the drama
Tell them the rhymes they wrote for you should have been a lot tighter
I'll do anything for the greatest loser of all time
F my rhymes ever take to hind legs like a bear
And stand straight up in the air it's not fair
They tried to come at me with fear
And I couldn't spit that rhyme right now without freezing
Been underground for a thousand seasons
I'm underground for a thousand reasons
With ten thousand pieces
Dominate a whole entire species
Every piece is as strong as the first one
Put the pieces together
Blame me for the reason you're better
When you come back tougher than leather
When the crescent moon glow
Rise so high in the sky that all eyes can see him
But what wonders when the reliable will be allowed leave
One reason could be that this is a trap
This is called Ripper Rap
The ripper spills whiskey from a flask
There's a difference in the ways we were made to behave
I landslide you to the lava below
I landslide you to the lava below
When you're the only reason I even bought a beeper
Ain't nothing that I wouldn't do to get with a
Dark skinned blackberry molasses type of sister
And at your own risk you can get on top of me
Baby something bout your love
Always seem to know just what to say to me
No one comes before you lady
Give you everything you need and more
All this time anticipating
All this time anticipating
I still feel your voice it runs right through me
I can't seem to get you out my head
All those things you said
All those things you said
Nothing in the world could shake it
Nothing comes before you lady
Give you everything you need and more
With all the time we spend every now and then
Baby tell me what I want to hear
Baby baby say you love me again
I used to have you in Atlantic City cashing chips
A hundred square yard garage with flashy whips
Deep down inside I'm the man you missed
Whenever we made love it was passionate
I take you to court for the custody of your body
I lick you from your toes to your edible under garments
We could do it Bow Wow style
All this time anticipating
All this time anticipating
It ain't nothing to be proud of brother
Everything else is all evil
Identity distorts our survival collectively
The magic magnetically protected me hermetically
Energetically I never fuck with telepathy
You act like a asshole
If you disagree then you need more bars
With a powder keg strapped to the back of your head
The invaded armada at dawn
You know I won a title a couple a times did right
No but they can't hurt us man
You don't want me to shine
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills
We got an illegal low blow on the fighter in the blue trunks
We came to see a fight
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
It's about who strikes the hardest not who strikes first
Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March 9th
God bless his soul rest in peace kid
It's because of him now at least I know What Beef is
Somebody that he's got to know is better than him
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
Now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Make your wife get on the horn call Minister Farrakhan
He forgot what a hardcore artist is
Trained to run 20 miles in soft sand
I'll battle you on the net
I'll battle you in the flesh
I'll battle you for the respect
I'll battle you over a blank check
I'll battle you with a gun to my neck
Inside the jail y'all fenced prisoners look tense
Armed with shanks waiting for the battle commence
Pick up the phone and call in the side with the highest
I politic with any magazine columnist
About topics other emcee's won't even bother with
Rock solid shit like stones and monuments
It's obvious the third eye of the obelisk is watching us
I utilize every letter of the Arabic alphabet
To touch a part of your body that makes you feel erogenous
From the womb to the the devolution I bring is a diagrammatic enigma
Somebody pass my diadem
You probably think that it's incubus
Because I'm an inimical epiphany
I pose for Rolling Stones with swollen bones
And they can't wait for the fucking album to blow
My style is not even something unknown yet
I can't believe what we do for ends
You know we don't play around
The sink goes cold when I put your nose to my ice
Train not to miss one drop when I'm dripping
I arm wrestle you with my polio arm in a rodeo barn
Nowadays I see emcees get on stage
They look like parakeets in a cage
Sour posses show up to your party
Like they don't know I'm too strategic for this dumb shit
But they don't know that because they slower than a snail
Now how real is this situation that I stay in
It takes me no brains to leave you with no brains
I got you so pegged this is so unfair
Cause really all I gotta do is cock and squeeze
While I'm in the trees with top notch emcees
How we're gonna stack this money and lounge
Call your man I get you that
When I'm on the fiends come through and devour the shit
When you find pieces of your son's body
Rhymes retarded and bars is downs syndrome
I paint my name on your back like connect the dot
Javelins hawk within striking distance
So does the white tail buck and the black bears
Back to the kill site
Surrounded by dark so far from the city lights
Alien tongues long sharp but called predator claws
I rip through the Kevlar for your heart
Till your lower body support lost
My hands change when I drink Beowulf bane
You ain't seen nothing nearly as strange
I got a scarface from back in my dog days
That smoke two p's with a c in between em
And we sip a very substantial amount of Jack Daniels
We invested all of legal drug money profit
You never get the chance to shoot back at who shot at you
Looking at you laying there with blood coming out your nostrils
Before heavy d bounced to uptown became a ghost town
But he still gets busy on the one and two's regardless
Sign our own acts and rhyme about whatever we wanna rap
Decorate our walls with plaques
The old school Hip Hop is where I get my style from
Area 51 is where I be getting rhymes from
I'm not a human being
I'm the human being ill with a IQ that's off the scale
I'm learning to be the head instead of the tail
I ain't following nobody else to increase my sales
Stood before the judge told him I was forced to kill
I'd rather be a lion for a day than a lamb who lives forever
Yo 6 o'clock every morning you waking up yawning
To the sound of your alarm clock alarm
About an hour from now
You should be at the place of employment
It affects your occupational performance
You wonder why your work load is so enormous
Because your boss just laid off three quarters of the whole office
From the stress that the corporate environment causes
Regardless of how you ultimately wanna solve this
You could take a new job offer for more chips
Stick it out a little longer or forfeit
But my advice to anybody that wants to quit
Take this job and shove it
Take this job and shove it
Take this job and shove it
Put your middle finger up slowly
Put it close enough to his face so he can examine it closely
Tell your spouse what happened and where you are
So they can come and get you in the car later on
And help you search for a new 9 to 5 job
If the unemployment line ain't that long
But if you hate it all you gotta do is get mad and tell the boss to
Take this job and shove it
Take this job and shove it
Take this job and shove it
The boss is favored and get placed in something spacious
While the most hated get placed in some small cubicle spaces
Twelve months passed by and you still ain't get paid yet
Here's a optimistic motto
If you ever late for today you could say you early for tomorrow
Probably the best fashion if you have it
The only one he open up to is you
But it never sound tougher than mines
So much time passed I just can't adjust all the time
There are fifty thugs in the room here's what we done
If you can then you are not my enemy
And if can not then I must make you a better emcee
Lets turn to page three we'll start there
The contract says you gotta have a thousand bars to spare
You think this type of Hip Hop is one dimensional but it's not
I know you well though
You think you can out rap me HELL NO
Unknown till I step to the microphone
In a condo bench pressing bags of brown rice
They used to call me a mental case
But one day men will say he immigrated beyond Heaven's gate
My net worth is my next verse
In a race to a billion bars what if you could get there first
He had guns attached his guns where black
Stuck heads to thumb tacks placed on a wall sized map
This is not sorcery this is just a lyrical part of me
My artistry please pardon me
So I can watch satellites comb over the Earth
I count thousands they probably just stole my verse
It's a hard job but somebody got do it
It's a hard job but somebody got do it
Ain't shit been this sick since the legalization of Christianity
Mentally I explore universally there's no boxing me in
The two sickest scientist emcees probing the galaxy
Come dance with the stars and get bullet scars
Your attempts of deception can't deter our direction
There's always something better so we keep perplexing
Our manuscripts are sicker than Saddam
We'll use his own blood to rewrite the Koran
So I enlist one of the grittiest emcees on the Planet Earth
To help me with this shit
It's a hard job but somebody gotta do it
Your style is like the airport we run right through it
Omnipresent omnipotent insurmountable
Malicious discrepancy of ridiculousness
I roll with the animals like a zoologist
Get facetious then make you pray like a mantis
It's a Hard Job but somebody got do it
Bis and Murray we run right through it
It's a Hard Job but somebody got do it
Bis and Murray we run right through it
Eyes low so I still won't rhyme slow
You know I wanna flow when you see my eyes glow
As ridiculous as a dinosaur bird
Stand back talking shit like it's none of my business
Is you homo and you swallow dick
Now you're dealing with the problems and the politics
You the opposite of what I am
You in a wasteland pacing back and forth in the sand
I'm more independent than them
The only thing I give a fuck about is lead in my pen
I'm on a higher level than them
I didn't have to sell my soul to the devil to win
Maybe I should invest in some stocks and bonds
Drive out to Vegas and stick my cock in a few broads
Princesses tongue kiss frogs
On the West Coast you can do whatever the fuck you want
No emcee is more loyal than I
To the moment I expire and I physically die
End up stabbed in the isle with some scissors
It take me a second to jump in the action
Till you understand it wasn't no joke
Give a fuck if I'm broke
You ain't got enough bars to harass me
No emcee is more loyal than I
Then hold the line for me when I launch the attack
But they said enough is enough
A bald head for a cold ass crown
Till you see me hopping out the Coupe wit e sermon
Or hopping out the Keith Murray suburban
My furious mindset is complex
Killing shit like a carnivorous militant prehistoric monster
Landed in an unidentified flying object
Turn you into an unidentified frying carcass
The smell of raw flesh make you nauseous
My metaphors sting like after haircuts when
The alcohol is applied to the raw skin
So whoever wanna battle get blasted
I stuck my dick in everything from asshole to the nasal passage
Now she got nobody to blame
Three in the squad plus me equal four members
An extra addition for any special force mission
Let me draw a brief description of what happened
I caught the next guy running by with the metal hook
The case is that I split your melon
And open fire on any trains now
You may never know who's in your shadow
Blast you in your face and disregard your vest
Just to let you pussies know how I'm living
Seems I steps with aggression
To any bitch who think they nice in this profession
I break your style down to little fragments
Followed by knife wounds to the chest for your attempt to retaliate
I noticed all you bitches flows is based around clothes
Before the thought even finishes
This wild style must run in my genes
Because my sister's in the county and my brother just came home from green
After plasma transfusion I became Rasputin
The master of translucence who lives in a green house
Before Lucifer sent me back to the future to smash computers
Sometimes it seems like my eyes are wide shut like Stanley Kubrick
You know what happens when you come from dishonest roots
When nobody can touch your lunch meat
The stock market trade off doesn't pay off
Their vaccines give ya eczema of the penis
The Tuskegee Jesus verses a sneaky Tuskegee Demon
I crawled out of a meteorite crater
They erased me and my sanity escaped me
From the constellation of Aquarius
The logo was branded on the back of the savage
She and I stand before a rabbi in dark fabric
The best man is a jealous scumbag maggot
Could've been more productive with less breath
To sideways 8 till something great unfolds
Stars come to life like UFOs moving in the night
I memorize the movements of the lights
Stingray sharp barbed darts launch from the heart
But you'll be fine after average recovery time
Breast plates move when I give chase
You gonna have to face the champ
My sword is honed from Red Dragon's rib bones
If the target ever stands in one spot
Suffocate you till you mourn for a truce
Then place you in a bathtub of carrion beetles
The gravity pull your body apart like mozzarella
You understand what the fuck I'm saying now
Sourdough biscuits and warmed up beans
Live buzzers indicate that you're all outnumbered
Got caught in the remedy of an untimely loss
Ishmael's blood pumps to my pen from my veins
Meditate and say names
Meditate and say the names
We live divided so the workers are violent
I bust my sixteen by using a touchscreen
I'll take your beat CD and throw it on the floor
You gave me the same beat you already gave me before
I transform into a beast with wide teeth
To survive I had to lay your dead body on top of me
Can't describe how I be dropping these odysseys
Lyrically perform cartography
Don't ever think that you can spit a verse better than mine
I just do what I do all the time and bust the rhymes
The beat is crazy and it's about time
These emcees are also one of a kind
Nuclear bomb and it's in your facility
Y'all can not handle the sick bar ability
Now just for the record kid
Keeping rap alive with every page of my scriptures
My instinct helps me to weed out my soon to be victims
With verses so high above you clowns
Was poised to take shit over since I looked through that peephole
Some say to aim for the sky and all your plans will unfurl
But why see the sky is the limit when I'm out of this world
Nuclear bomb and it's in your facility
Y'all cannot handle the sick raw ability
The swagger of Marcy is proof your army is through
I will violently annihilate your lying regime
Iraq to Palestine inscribed in rhyme on my sleeve
Falcon the talons will tear your scalp as I fly through your team
I am the meanest alive since the rising of phoenix
You would swear I was paraplegic the way I step on the track's an irreconcilable FEET
Sickly over your head like the toxins of a condom's texture
You finally reach the top and you're type scared
Push you off with Brooklyn force the mountainside will silence screams
Trying to attain the ire of Poseidon spit sublime like his trident and get divine as the deep
Your system is finished and I am the virus prescribed by the Highest
It was God that designed me to breach
Nuclear bomb and it's in your vicinity
Y'all can not handle the sick bar ability
There is no force to save him
Your knowledge is nothing but nonsense
This is not a lyrical contest
Degrees decrease as soon as the signature of the heat decode
Believe me it's more worse than it sounds
If the testimony dimensional genetics
Connecting my spiritual past to my spiritual present
You want a lesson then book the session
We curse and burp like Wyatt Earp
Once a day I drink Gatorade in the shade
Special Ed plays I got it made
I write under chem lights same color tent types
With dry hemoglobin on his pants
But no matter how it ends I'd do it all again
So be careful how you approach things
You must be getting insecure or something
I been through a lot of things in my life but I learned from it
The only difference between me and you is a budget
When I was fucked up you didn't give a couple G's to help
You want all the hot beats and the streets to yourself
Besides a little drama with my first two records
If I win the lottery you can't tell me how to spend it
You got something to say don't put your henchmen in it
Don't tell me that your school of Hard Knocks turned preppy
None of you mother fuckers know me and you never met me
And if my name wasn't shit then you wouldn't sweat me
High when I wrote this but sober when I spoke it
I went out and bought your album two times I ain't hating
Next thing I know you're talking Jamaican like you're a native
I had nothing before and I have nothing now
Representing Sharpshooters to the fullest
Where I learn verbal weaponry to conquer my enemies
Armed for war using words as my weapons
We clash like Satan and Christ at Armageddon
Scaring every MC out the city
Like diving in a pool of razorblades with immune deficiency
Publicly with every MC and DJ in the country under me
Airborne off the turnbuckle to touch you
Tear bones off the muscle
The awful scent of bloody flesh and barnacles haunt you
Couldn't kill me with a 50 cal round
A three hundred fifty pound Hound with a canine growl
I scan the road from a mud hole like Rambo
Let me get a fix on this fool
I drool when it's time to get tools
Water board torture below zero temperature
Fibrillate your heart till you fart
Feed you pork soaked in sodium salt
Big weapons spark like tuning forks in the dark
When we walk do not gawk at the corpse laying on the sidewalk
Heads are detached from the respiratory tracts
Pardon the approach I thought you was walking too slow
No one who is able to hear will care
Those with compassionate care cannot conquer fear
The final battle won't be in space but right here
Thirty two thousand four hundred Maidenhead squares
If I ever get to rap behind you.
What about the freestyles I put on vinyl
Here's a FYI to I can rip
But you don't have the mental bandwidth to understand Bis
But when they get their feet chopped off
They can't walk the walk
In my former life my name was Ricardo
Lyrical linguistic twist shit like licorice sticks
I spit verses similar to curses
But ya condition just worsens
Play six feet Beneath the Surface
Along with the worms and the serpents
Some kind of divine therapist
Come back to the states as a terrorist
Cops touch me then I sever they wrist
Ask yourself what type of era this is
White phosphorous clouds eject through the neck
To emcees who become recruits
The constitution been reconstituted
Multiplicity effects take me higher yet
Happy hour empowers the mind
The stars begin to move closer
The eye of the wormhole opens
Behind me the Stargate closes
I sit down and make poetry in motion
The table and chair where I sit start floating
Classified rogue poet component
The flood was not an obstacle
The lamp is symbolic how they worship the phallus
Since my female vampire lover
The last time I had sex with a dragon princess
The Gubernatorial that never ends
Otherwise the Global Mind wouldn't affect your kids
With a burst of wind... That create Jam Master J
He can paint a rendition of your face
Spit cold saliva out the window of my low rider
Gold visors protect the eyes of the microphone pilot
That's it's that's it automatic
That's it Rip The Jacker interact with this Rap shit
Spectators have no patience and high expectations
Every sixteenth bars a laser
Thumb bases at a dozen locations
The fallout residue is lyrically corrosive
I crawled out of a meteorite crater
They erased me and my sanity escaped me
From the constellation of Aquarius
The logo was branded on the back of the savage
She and I stand before a rabbi in dark fabric
The best man is a jealous scumbag maggot
Could've been more productive with less breath
To sideways 8 till something great unfolds
Stars come to life like UFOs moving in the night
I memorize the movements of the lights
Stingray sharp barbed darts launch from the heart
But you'll be fine after average recovery time
Breast plates move when I give chase
You gonna have to face the champ
My sword is honed from Red Dragon's rib bones
I'm about eight thousand miles away from home
Thinking about the throne I got my eyes fixated on
I just put an add in The Source to cause a little controversy
Came from doing a concert in Jersey last Thursday
He called my name out more than a few times and tried to embarrass me
I bet he's probably never even heard of me
It didn't even occur to me he was involved personally
I seen him on the street last week he cursed at me
And anytime that I'm ready that he's got a verse for me
I guess he ain't the only emcee that's nervous of me
There ain't a person in the game wit more courage than me
Man I got a nice feeling
I'm working on my fourth album and when I think about it I've had a tight career
Haven't I made it quite clear
Rip the Jacker was a nightmare
Jack the Ripper reminds me of him and I don't really like that
What type of a life is that
It's like Anthony Hopkins giving Norman Bates a nightcap
But I raise the price so high that in fact
I guess the world's chaos is spinning over the raps
Don't act like you don't know Bis
The man with the organic tongue and the golden spit
I left you frozen stiff
With malted Aluminum and molded tip
Probably quicker than you can think
As quick as ink drives my rhymes are contagious like pink eye
Before I even knew him I already had a buzz
But that was then and this is now
Bis been ripping in down since the day he came out
I move over to France where the loves at
Become a bureaucrat and start cutbacks
Capable of altering a man's blood pattern
Humanitarianism will love that
Completely cover the map before I come back
I wanna give Alicia Keys a kiss
Compose a ballad and just make her fiend for Bis
And after this you could never not believe in Bis
Took a minute to exhibit that I'm sick with it
At a thousand degrees Celsius I make emcees melt
Like a javelin to stab you in the abdomen
The intellectual athlete accurately rapping so rapidly
Yet he makes perfect sense mathematically
Rhymes ricochet off the inner walls of my lungs
And go past the tongue faster than bullets come out of guns
Whenever the head is severed from the human body with a sharp enough weapon
The brain remains conscious for ten seconds
I'll hop into the back seat of a cab and rhyme
I'm hardcore from the nappy follicles in my pores
From my jaws to my torso where my organs are stored
And from my balls in my drawers to the floor
I pray to God they hurry up and start the Third World War
I don't give a fuck if you rich or you poor
Don't give a fuck if you got your picture in The Source or Forbes
I don't give a fuck who won an award
Let they blood pour all on the floor
I'll leave your corpse stiff as a board
Getting in my way is like jumping in front of a car
I'll send you to hell where you belong
Who could flow for four minutes or more
Got millions of styles and I've mastered them all
A metaphor matador fast enough to make the bull charge and crash in the wall
Get everything in the club thrown at you and your crew
I'll snatch your crown with your head still attached to it
I'll battle you with a gun to my neck
I'd rather be a lion for a day than a lamb who lives forever
Then bust a shot in the motherfucking courtroom and watch it clear out
Lyrics got my undivided loyalty
And there ain't nothing on this God damn planet that's worth more to me
I'd beat his ass and took my tape back
Then I bust you with a shotgun blast
It's not fun so I don't laugh
Trapped in a max security building
Suffering from a severe illness called brilliance
They sent doctors in protective suits
Army recruits in small groups torture me for the truth
Wrap me up in cellophane and dump my body in the trunk of a coupe
Instead I find myself blindfolded and stripped naked
Being interrogated by some highly professional agents
One in the background was Jamaican
Transmitting from an undisclosed location
Pirate stations with phantom frequency modulations
The bad news is I got a tight flow
Swimmers in my saliva river drown when I give it to them
Waves engulfed my boat but I managed to float
Religion is the producer on the ones and twos
Religion is the producer on the ones and twos
Content be out of context for the masses
Dangerous forefather Poor Pauper emcee
For the past month he's been suspended in part three
I see both Devil and God agree nobody rhyme like me
Including human bones sewn to my zone
If I showed the masses where we was at or where we was going
For technologically advanced weapons
And the focal point of our problems on this planet are not domestic
You can accept it or be stupid and be a skeptic
And fail to recognize the secret society's death wish
Responsible for laundering trillions of dollars from the nation
For the construction of underground military installations
Abductions and cattle mutilations
Experiments on human patients
Can take place in several subterranean bases
A hundred and fifty stories below a basement
They create strange creations
Top secret special operations
That didn't believe in the Drake equation
Well you need to know that this is a game
And we're being betrayed and played in the worst way
Was truly a single entity that's not what he would say
Short staccato clicks and beeps
A highly advanced form of speech
Even though to us it seems like they're only chattering they teeth
They used to swim deep in the oceans beneath
Till their fins transformed into limbs and they started to creep
Then they evolved into mammals with feet
And walked right from the shorelines onto the beach
That could slow time and the speed of light down
To any point in the Universe
Living organisms and various
Space expedition teams in the lunar region
To walk across the moon without leaving a clue
Before life on the surface even appeared
I hope you've become aware what I'm spitting in your ear
The goddamn truth this ain't nothing to dance to
While the Son of Sam prepares for war
My hands form ram horns
Daddy ain't to shabby he rarely rhymes badly
Better holster that weapon when you walk in this direction
Pull a rhyme out the burlap and murder your raps
Where emcees try to battle to see if they might blow...
When all lyricist were bold an spoke from the soul...
Modality outside the womb was changed...
When I was exhumed... It will change once again soon...
Emcee's recycled for redistribution...
Catch you before you can catch breath...
The Garrison park leads to my Gallery of art...
Following flattery of sloth before we battle in the dark...
Is the repair frequency for the damaged DNA...
You will never recover from the torment...
Photographers snap shots of bright orbs and objects in Earths orbit...
To afford a small Log cabin overlooking Rippers Rivers Fall...
An encourage you spit a million bars...
To each and every Emcee who ever spit a rap...
Brace yourself for The Impact...
Captain Cold Crush get busy on the track...
Brace yourself for The Impact...
So In The Ring you cannot win...
So In The Ring you cannot win...
It's the impact... impact
Only true warriors spit with me...
The Angel of death... Put these pagans to rest...
On the pulpit of rap... Making a Declaration of War...
Cold Crush Got my back...
Grip ya DNA an rip ya double helix apart...
Brace yourself the Impact...
As I watch the Meteorite coming towards the Horizon...
I brace myself for The Impact...
So In The Ring you cannot win...
So In The Ring you cannot win...
Inject the music hormones into my spongy bone
The human genome altered by very high frequency notes
Frequently flow till it completely unfolds
First brigade 25th replacement ID
Rhymes metastasize from the inside
Psychic assassins take vaccination tablets
In case they come in contact with contaminated rappers
The more you say be nice the more I want to fight
I don't want to hear shit about the legislation for climate change
That's for people who own private planes
Snakes don't walk and shadows don't talk
That's what we all thought but we thought wrong
Eat the gun and tell me if it needs more salt
The verbal assault virus leads edutainment
And now its time to Rip the Jacker
No rapper could rap quite like I can
Calling yourself the greatest is something you don't do
There's a rumor going around that I got dropped
Two hundred thousand albums sold at ten dollars a pop
All these magazines tried to steamroll me to death
Plus I heard Simone was the high school slut
And she learned how to fuck before she knew how to cuss
You and your man Russell made a better couple
Your being watched even when you take a dump
The chairs at your label got ears and the walls got eyes
The truth is Mr. Smith you got a fucked up attitude
God knows that I pity your fans for backing you
The Greatest Liar Of All Time that cannot rhyme
That cannot shine as long as I'm alive
And that microphone on your arm will always be mine
Now you're in a world where the hunter becomes the hunted
You can't sleep at night thinking about the drama
Tell them the rhymes they wrote for you should have been a lot tighter
I'll do anything for the Greatest Loser Of All Time
Jakes that want to handcuff us
Foes that want to touch us
Kidnap your baby's mother's mother
So our voices is twice as horrifying at an expensive price
Injected into the arms of all your Hip Hop fiends
I break your bicuspid with your own jaw
A flick of the wrist and you're gone
Lost in limbo like pink shit camouflaged in a pig farm
I'll start from your forehead
My God that sounds horrid
Wipe the ammonium nitrate across the side of your face
And y'all steady screaming for war but want peace
Ya trying to walk two dogs with one leash
I'll stab you through your fucking temple with a floorboard
To see the universal through a cats eyes
Once I duct tape you to the front of a Mack truck's fascia
Peel you off till you drop on the floor
Squeeze your neck harder when you start to cough
I bet you never thought this could happen just for pissing me off
Top four point fingers and watch through binoculars
Where the enemies exchange negative energy
But you can't forgive and forget with an elephant memory
But let's keep that between me and you
It doesn't seem real when your spleen spill
So listen to what I'm spitting at y'all
Come on y'all your getting hit in the chest
Ripping the rest and all y'all seek is ashes
I love reading Koran in pitch blackness
I love reading the psalms to bitch actors
Underground manure rap from the sewer rat
Captured tagged released the microphone Beast from the East
Over Marco Polo beats I black out the Baa Baa Black Sheep
What you gonna do when you meet an emcee just like you
This is what is to be expected with no direction
A probe was sent to get an answer for a question in a scripted sentence
Not to mention what ever I recommended before the verse ended
Worth their own weight in gold in the game
Lord Finesse in the flesh spit a bar per request
I feel as if everything I've learned
Has made be obsolete before I could even say one word
What I said it not what you heard or what you thought you observed
The vision is getting blurred but you have to be sure
What does it feel like to be a rap legend
That's what I used to believe
My musical policy was renewable
One in every ten males could get it for themselves
Came back to cure the world's ills
With every other available pressure
Time keep on slipping
How can I create the right sentence to help explain
Put you up against War Machine
The Microphone Fiend on the scene
Laser beam lyrics coming at you with an altered speed
The Altered Beast don't pause for the beat
You pole vault into a wall of defeat
The man is wise... Scan through the air with his eyes
Cabin air analyze rhymes
100 bottles of beer on the wall
Just cross the finish line screaming
Jesse charted the precise approach coordinates
Hypoxia Calisthenics... Reanimate the subjects
STOP. Let us watch the horse grow crops
Lyrically if you can do the same let me see
If you can than you are not my enemy
And if can not than I must make you a better MC
Lets turn to page three we'll start there
The contract says you gotta have a thousand bars to spare
You think this type of hip hop is one dimensional but it's not
You don't understand what I gave you
You don't understand what you got
I know you well though
You think you can out rap me HELL NO
Unknown till I step to the microphone
They used to call me mental case
But one day men will say he immigrated beyond heavens gate
My net worth is my next verse
In a race to a billion bars what if you could get there first
He had guns attached his guns where black
Stuck here to thumb tacks placed on a wall sized map
This is not sorcery this is just a lyrical part of me
My artistry please pardon me
So I can watch satellites go over the earth
I count thousands they probably just stole my verse
It's a Hard Job but somebody got do it
We network power moves
Don't make your gun go click click boom
Make you play hide and go seek with your demons
You can meet you maker
Step into my face and you is a faker
I'll put you in an incubator
Walk up to your forehead and paint across it
What the fuck you looking back for it's the last lap
Torsion field twist steel blow the air back off wheel
You are dragged from the car and killed
I spit that shit to make me run out the booth
I got to say peace to my uncle Snoop
We smoke chronic leaves into a poof
And everybody knows we some lyrical fools
When they guess the metaphors they be like ooh
And linger in the mind like displaced rage
We make that hardcore tailor made
You know you don't wanna go man for man power on the streets
It's the grandsons of the son of man
Of the sickest sickest sickest Son of Sam
Touch your territory and get a shorty to translate the language for me
To make sure that you can't ignore me
My tongue will slice you eight ways like pizza
Set fire to the Garden of Eden for my freedom
Spit a hundred meaningless bars for no reason
There ain't an emcee on the planet who could see this
Ain't no mother fucker ill like me
Step in the conference room and get your wig peeled back
In a lyrical grudge match
Show you what I sacrificed for
Memoirs of an emcee writing and dividing up the bars
The beast from a place with no peace
The emcee of a special breed that has special needs
I told them stiff arms help the aim
The rest of y'all ain't saying nothing
I take you beyond the blitzkrieg verse and back
Inject the music hormones into my spongy bone
The human genome altered by very high frequency notes
First brigade 25th replacement ID
Rhymes metastasize from the inside
Psychic assassins take vaccination tablets
In case they come in contact with contaminated rappers
The more you say be nice the more I want to fight
I don't want to hear shit about the legislation for climate change
That's for people who own private planes
Snakes don't walk and shadows don't talk
The verbal assault virus leads edutainment
The gravity pull your body apart like mozzarella
You understand what the fuck I'm saying now
Sourdough biscuits and warmed up beans
Live buzzers indicate that you're all outnumbered
Got caught in the remedy of an untimely loss
My life's like the Passion of Christ
Lay my hand on the middle of your forehead to show you what I seen
You never seen the best before
That was killed when a shell from the sky had bombed the school
Waiting for the book to go to print soon
War the hardcore raw metaphor
Bout to blackout one time for ya
I'm as dangerous as they come
Dangerous with or without a gun
I've been dangerous from day one
Stick to your ribs like chicken and think gravy from Roscoe's
Or struck with some stone till you fill numb in the bones
Send a signal to my index and tell it to fold in the direction of wrist bone
To release your soul I told you to freeze
If I was you I would have froze but you chose that other route
And got blown full of holes a pistol to ya mug cripple ya tongue
Rip through ya lungs then write your name on your tombstone
But the ghostwriter get slaughtered by a tiger
My style is sicker then infected women and men
I'm so raw I can caught AIDS without stick in it in
Switch my language up like a black kid raised by a Spanish nanny
After tonight you'll have a testicular tumor
To Trick Daddy and Trina down in Miami
To Cali with a raspberry daiquiri I'll assault
And battle you badly words fire rapidly
Like heavily armed apaches piloted by a trigger
Happy Iraqi with extremely bad acne
Got ya counters drum roll when I start to flow
I stomp across continents to conquer my art
I'm millennium lyricist area 51 physicist
Rhymes hot to melt the wax off the turntables
Sharper then scissor tips sharper then rings on
You figure since you already a pussy you might as well
Give me syphilis envious cause my rhymes is infinite
Lyrically I'm bananas
Organically enhanced with third millennium medical standards
My DNA was tampered with
By genetic engineers with scholarship grants that studied at Stanford
I turn spit to gas vapor than back to spit
Make you nauseous till you vomit
See I been there done that
A little short coming less than what the fans wanted
My new album is disgusting
Then it's Jim Baker all over again
We run out of time tell the label to cancel my flight
Tell hits from the street I'm about to jack a whole hour from his show
Make the whole wake up show throw they hands up
Since the wake up show
Its empty ill and gray matter
I do a selectively crew
Nephew just a Brontosaurus with a sixth sense
Walking around not even knowing that he don't exist
That I mandate that I replicate 1988
Fool its 2000 so get a life do you know what these
Rugged ghetto streets look like
Gonna hate you for real like you got on BET
War the hardcore raw metaphor
Bout to blackout one time for ya
I'm as dangerous as they come
Dangerous with or without a gun
I've been dangerous from day one
Stick to your ribs like chicken and think gravy from Roscoe's
Or struck with some stone till you fill numb in the bones
Send a signal to my index and tell it to fold in the direction of wrist bone
To release your soul I told you to freeze
If I was you I would have froze but you chose that other route
And got blown full of holes a pistol to ya mug cripple ya tongue
Rip through ya lungs then write your name on your tombstone
But the ghostwriter get slaughtered by a tiger
My style is sicker then infected women and men
I'm so raw I can caught AIDS without stick in it in
Switch my language up like a black kid raised by a Spanish
After tonight you'll have a testicular tumor
To Trick Daddy and Trina down in Miami
To Cali with a raspberry daiquiri I'll assault
And battle you badly words fire rapidly
Like heavily armed apaches piloted by a trigger
Happy Iraqi with extremely bad acne
Got ya counters drum roll when I start to flow
I stomp across continents to conquer my art
I'm millennium lyricist area 51 physicist
Rhymes hot to melt the wax off the turntables
Sharper then scissor sharper then rings on
You figure since you already a pussy you might as well
Give me syphilis envious cause my rhymes is infinite
We go hard like terrorists smuggling bombs
Blow up a plane fuselage with the president on board
We get our point across like a trapeze artist without falling
When you see me give me a pound and shut the fuck up
The hardcore metaphor war trilogy
With a verbal chemistry punks can't understand
Special operatives rocking this to get the proper burn
They won't even dispatch the call if my name is involved
Full of secret service security
Transporting me back and forth from the Affirmative Action university
In aircraft that takeoff and land vertically
The fact that I ain't treated like a king is absurd to me
Verbally murdering you thoroughly without effort
I get drug tested before I can rhyme on a record
Remarkable specimen with an audible weapon
I got the reinforcements to crush any enemies offense
Extraterrestrial biological entities with infinite energy
Battling for world supremacy
With hard jigsaw puzzles and strong jaw muscles
Like Vietnamese in fatigues covered with leaves
Asking you to tell me exactly where that alien craft landed by flashing
Bright lights in your eyes with them silver cameras
So when you're revived you can't recall or understand it
I use amnesia to neutralize public panic
And take advantage of opportunities to do damage
I'll pierce your heart with evil thoughts
The only thing faster than the speed of light is the speed of dark
With the jaws of a Great White shark I'll rip you apart
My state of the art lyrical lasers is razor sharp
Splatter the brain matter of my enemies
With the same bullet trajectory that murdered John Kennedy
Never test me without proper authorization
My lack of patience has cause me to get mad
And explode right in front of your face like a airbag
I create lyrics too intricate to imitate
That's double the clock speeds of a 5-86
You'll be so surprised you won't believe your own eyes
From Shakespeare to Edgar Allen
Much less understand it
Lose they balance when I kick the planet
Satellites and cameras watching and listening
The reversal of the magnetism in the solar system
Power struggle to the finish
Hip hop was not made for the timid
Ready to fight for the dark man's birthright
The fuel truck just got topped off
Report back with a tactical overview
Target emcees who move between shrubs and trees
Track the migratory patterns of three quarters of the Earth's rappers
You better watch who you beef with
You got kidnapped and you don't even know the reason
Watch who you beef with
We all know how to hold the heat properly
You better watch who you beef with
You got kidnapped and you don't even know the reason
Watch who you beef with
We run up in radio stations on some unannounced shit
It'll probably be something you regret
You'll get wet with horizontal rain droplets
That cause earthquakes
You shouldn't have started this shit in the first place
You better watch who you beef with
You got kidnapped and you don't even know the reason
Watch who you beef with
Put a red dot on your head like you Hindu
Then put a hole in you big enough to put my open fist through
One and a half million in cash when it's delivered
And holds your crucifix tighter when shells is firing
You need to watch who you beef with
You better watch who you beef with
You got kidnapped and you don't even know the reason
Watch who you beef with
You need to watch who you beef with
You need to watch who you beef with
These lyrics are so cataclysmic
The hours become minutes whenever I spit it
Motivated by the starts and I bust a 100 Bars
You will be detained in the black list registry
Notice I spit it rapid with my cryptic language
You will become acquainted with my mystic manners
Searching for the ritual widow urgently
An apple that came from Rome might bite and snap your bones
Back from the territories of darkness with a gun heartless
She lives in a house on the hillside
Some kind of a man who tried to civilize the human family throughout the populace
One time my spine was broken in half like Batman
And you find yourself in a blue world and die again from a gun in my hand
You all burst into water like a bubble
Fire is an element belonging to water
The Egyptian beetles eat you scandalous on a lethal ice planet
I came from the dark city of Los Angeles
Something my psych profile doesn't show
I don't have all the answers I am not in the know
I can only see what is above and only from below
An aircraft bomber jacket made of leather
A gun in the alternate future is my weapon that severs
But in rhyme you could never get your varsity letter
The arsonist who has become a patriarch in the dark from arsenic
The redeemer and a marksmen
Take out Hip Hop's trash and garbage
My lyrical is chemical radioactive residue
I can't rest until I accomplished what I was sent to do
These lyrics are so cataclysmic
The hours become minutes whenever I spit it
Motivated by the starts and I bust a 100 Bars
You will be detained in the black list registry
Notice I spit it rapid with my cryptic language
You will become acquainted with my mystic manners
Searching for the ritual widow urgently
An apple that came from Rome might bite and snap your bones
Back from the territories of darkness with a gun heartless
She lives in a house on the hillside
Some kind of a man who tried to civilize the human family throughout the populace
One time my spine was broken in half like Batman
And you find yourself in a blue world and die again from a gun in my hand
You all burst into water like a bubble
Fire is an element belonging to water
The Egyptian beetles eat you scandalous on a lethal ice planet
I came from the dark city of Los Angeles
Something my psych profile doesn't show
I don't have all the answers I am not in the know
I can only see what is above and only from below
An aircraft bomber jacket made of leather
A gun in the alternate future is my weapon that severs
But in rhyme you could never get your varsity letter
The arsonist who has become a patriarch in the dark from arsenic
The redeemer and a marksmen
Take out Hip Hop's trash and garbage
My lyrical is chemical radioactive residue
I can't rest until I accomplished what I was sent to do
Divide my senses by six and you'll end up with triple sixes
And triple the digits mean triple the spirits
My light body to the third power will triple my lyrics
Eight hours of writing and memorizing a manuscript
Paparazzi should probably be taking pictures of this
My fans in the street with signs trying to picket for this
I can go four quarters or nine innings for this
Lead crusades across Europe like the Christians for this
The notion I'm dedicated is an understatement
Hunt them like Jurassic Park actors
Follow me down the road to Damascus
Drink a gallon of cyanide and still can not die
And put my book of rhymes through a shredder
Beyond the length of this rhyme you have no future
Pounce upon you like a puma or some wild cougars
In the jungle with my adrenaline juices flowing through them
Hypnotize the audience you perform in front of to start booing
Shut your mother fucking mouth and don't say nothing
You have the right to remain silent
A lot of clowns keep arguing on who the best is
Bite the style but can't digest it
Till they get karate kicked in the mouth and their teeth get ejected
You buy one back and you get one free
In the studio is where I put it down to the test
Give a copy to everybody that's down with Bis
First time anybody put me down to spit
Till I hear my voice banging up and down the block
Creating ripples in the water like aquanauts
I belong on top of the pops not on the bottom with rocks
I guess you can't write an infinite rhyme with a finite mind
That's why rhymes like mine mystify mankind
A lot of rappers are ahead of their time
The microphone is the paintbrush responsible for getting the point across
The canvas is the street
Where the master of the ceremony paints the picture for everybody to see
Nobody could rhyme this fluent
Nobody ever did what I'm doing
Nobody ever spit what I'm spewing
Plus I've got to show the people that I've got mad love for rap music
I bury emcees with rosary beads
A picture of their wife and their seeds and a picture of me
I'm as graceful as the left hand of Rembrandt
Put some instrumentals on and ask my pen to dance
Rhymes accelerate through the cyclotrons in nine microns
The opposite of a black lung is a white one
I'll bring a new meaning to the phrase dead end
Crack your teeth till you mouth sounds like a tambourine
With an automated overbite
Calculate the distance between worlds through worm holes
To escape when the earth blows
You never seen lyrics fly so fast
I look directly into human eyes to see if you pussy
And completely ruin your ability to lie to me
Now you can stand in front of me looking real silly
Or prepare to go to battle and kick a rhyme to me
Ask nine out of ten people on the planet
Revving my engines like they was powered by Le Man's
I'll leave you in troubled spirits
I'm absolutely the purest from the USA to Europe
My lyrical inertia rips holes through the fabric of universes
With rhymes three times the density of what the earth is
You against me is like a lighter against a furnace
Check the astrophysics of these lyrical lyrics
You might get beat the fuck up in broad daylight with a nightstick
Mentally advanced ever since the brain transplant
See physically I move at a velocity
That'll break your stopwatch if you clocking me
My brain consists of twin Pentium chips
That's double the clocked speeds of a 586
Nothing about my physical matrix is basic
I kick flavor beyond what your tongue is capable of tasting
You'll be so surprised you won't believe your own eyes
It's like a Jamaican seeing it snow for the first time
Rhymes of a sort that distort space and time
It's like explaining color to a man that was born blind
My sperm will scramble the eggs in a woman's ovaries
Breaking the laws of physics with metaphors and lyrics
Speaking to dead poets by conjuring up their spirits
From Shakespeare to Edgar Allan
Much less understand it
The secret of the ages I illuminate with logic
With common sense I'm organized like crime and mafias
I'll politic with any magazine columnist
About topics other emcees won't even bother with
It's obvious the third eye of the obelisk is watching us
Ghetto scholars like me who study street calculus
I utilize every letter of the Arabic alphabet
To touch a part of your body that makes you feel erogenous
I drink a gallon of the ginseng extract
Harness all my lyrical power to rip tracks
I shed light upon pitch black
So at times even your third eye finds my rhymes too bright to glimpse at
I think back to before I was born
When suckers wasn't even involved in this art form
Now they write rhymes that reflect nothing but hard times
Electronically mailing my thoughts across the information highway
Trying to communicate with Yahweh
I speak a language that don't even require the tongue
Get in my face and your liable to get yours blown off
LL couldn't bring it to me if he had my home address
Infecting emcees with a disease there's no cure for
I'll freak a rhyme until your sampler stops counting the bars
And delegate laws as if I'm God
So call me arrogant if you want to
Uncle Sam wants you but he don't want me
My field of force is bigger than twenty golf courses
Eerie like government theories behind flying saucers
I go on and on and on for hours
Till batteries die then I spit to auxiliary power
I done been from Jersey to Brooklyn
Done been through Queens where the crooks hang
Done been on tour doing group things
Really love it when a girl got a cute name
Got a cute attitude and a cute frame
Done seen a lot more than some loose change
Do Egyptian Lover with two hands
Sometimes spend the whole day outdoors
Eating food in the pool
Music got us in that mood
Case of Cristal cost about six grand
Bitch better get a less expensive brand
Si Development will crash your satellite
It makes it easier to remember what I wrote to
Gatling gun shot down your soldiers like terracotta statues in Nicaragua
One thousand three hundred mixes later we still producing new shit
Catch you in the street like what's the issue
Monkey face I'll monkey flip you
I always wanted to dis you
You ugly as a pit bull motherfucker I'll rip you
Truth is I never thought your metaphors were hot
A typical hustler all you do is think about rocks
With a budget like yours you should a sold more
I think Jay fucked you go look at your deal
In that black mink you look like a ape for real
If I was blind and I couldn't tell
I'll probably still hear it from a bitch that you ugly as hell
For starters the Bentley ain't yours it's Shawn Carter's
And if it ain't Shawn's it's his partners
I'll turn my voice up loud so I can tell you was sup
Your whole crew softer than tofu
If you did then you knew I was a soldier too
Doing what you already sold your souls to do
I'm doing shows and my wrist stays frozen too
Battle you in the lobby or worldwide plaza make you resign on the spot
Rhymes accelerate through the cyclotrons in nine microns
The opposite of a black lung is a white one
I'll bring a new meaning to the phrase dead end
Crack your teeth till you mouth sounds like a tambourine
With an automated overbite
Calculate the distance between worlds through worm holes
To escape when the earth blows
You never seen lyrics fly so fast
We can rhyme fair and square or fair in the sphere
And they become cancer patients
Never been the type to talk
Till you turn blue in the face and die from asphyxiation
The stench of a thousand ounces
Don't give a fuck what month you dropping in
With pictures of you with a dick in your mouth and a dick in your ass
In order to keep my shit in order
Just like the stories of the hare and the tortoise
The rabbit was faster but fell asleep in the forest
And lost cause the tortoise had endurance
I always stay focused to artists
Immune to the garlic water and the crosses
After my last album I went through a metamorphosis
Probably fired more of my people than Doug Morris did
With the first strike I'm so nice
My styles adapt like luxury car suspension
Hip Hop ain't going nowhere
And remember I do this for you
Rip the Jacker in an underground fortress
I hear you spitting that bullshit
There are many things the rest of us would do if we could
I do whatever it takes to keep you alive
Standing in the corner
My iron fortress is protected by the Eye of Horus
The vile sorcerer that rides atop of wild horses
My consumer base is viewed as a mutant race
Humans that grew from the fumes of nuclear waste
And interchanged with an image of your living wraith
Children when I'm spitting written riddles in a fit of rage
I wanna murder motherfuckers with my vocal sound
I got the green light...
This was specifically written for you
Like the policy payments of a hospital patient
The homicidal rhymes that your mind made up
Grab the pad and write while I talk to the lab mice
I huff and puff and blow down the booth
Spit like a beast then I spiritual fast for two weeks
The eyeball of Odin recording every movement and moment
It's the phantom of the opera
The Dracula Caligula unpopular
Without proper gloves
Melt the skin off your fingers till they look like rounded nubs
Drunk punk with a puss filled prostate lump
You should have smelled that decomposing cunt
I'm a hunter that's ready to discontinue the hunt
But I'm gonna keep ripping you scum till the millennium's done
You couldn't pass if you was gassed out of your ass
I'll battle you in front of Sterling Library after class
Feces hit the fan from the front
Decapitate your face with a gun
Assassin with your tongue
After a four hundred and eighty foot jump
A genie bottle covered with porcupine follicles
Blood drips till the tub's flooded
My dead enemies lay there gutted
Till year two thousand and forty something
With some hydrochloric stuffed in the luggage
Resonances from my vocal tracks smothers the others
If I wanted to get at you I'd just infect your lover
Your girl's an exceptionally good sucker
Get technical with decibels that are connected to you
The audible is too incredible to sell them to you
I'd rather tuck you in at night and tell them to you
I introduce you to the new words and spell them for you
Burn you up faster than two hundred pounds of fuel
In helicopters doing loops out in Kabul
But I'll set it up so you win and celebrate it with you
I'll break the truth to you at a quarter till five
Look you square in the eye
And tell you that there's nowhere for you to hide
Triangulate your flow to wherever you rhyme
Kublai Khan proofread this verse for me
With Pentium circuitry
The best way to encourage me is to keep discouraging me
They keep trying to front on me
They don't want none of me
That's why I give the love back
When you're the reason I even bought a beeper
When you're the only reason I even bought a beeper
Ain't nothing that I wouldn't do to get with you
And at your own risk you can get on top of me
For those of you who failed to prepare. well now you must prepare to fail
It doesn't matter what your desire entails
I sit around the table with me ale
Here's a gold coin and some wisdom for you little girls and boys
And when he arrives you're going to see the fire in his eyes
He will help you uncover all of the lies
The lies that were told and spread across the globe
To enslave mankind until the end of time
Rip the Jacker and his infinite rhyme
You ostracized anybody that knew you
Experimenting with the Baxter effect
From Apollo 11 to moon base 12
I transport you from hell on Earth to space hell
I speak at frequencies frequently speaking
Ten million bars of lithium depletion is the reason I beat him.
They don't even understand what you spitting
This ain't for the average MC
The righteous will never venture down that path
The rough cold holds of the grumpy old man
I'm protected by the blood of the lamb
They running for they lives covered by the mud of the land
Motherfuckers can't even understand it
Only a handful of people know that
Dragons watching the Phoenix fly over the horizon
Your label treats you like a Hip Hop prostitute
And that's all I ever need to show
The weight of the world versus the weight of your poems
The main area of operations is chosen
Take two teams and call me when you get to the opening
Hip Hop done gave birth to the first MC
Heat resistant clothes found between your bone fragments
Any word that you ever wanted to visit
I got game for hoes and major dough
If you want to it then you came for more
Now all you need is a thug
You need a thug in your life
You need a thug in your life
Now all you need is a thug life
You need a thug a life
Give me right to my spot
Get a style of ya Own
You need a thug in your life
You need a thug in your life
Now all you need is a thug life
You need a thug a life
Can't stop till I get my hands on a mill
So baby let me take you through the eyes of a don
Now if you want to bone
You need a thug in your life
You need a thug in your life
Now all you need is a thug life
You need a thug a life
Now all you need is a thug
So you is what I ain't and it is what it is
Two chains on my first chain started cloning
If I die tonight I got a bank roll on me
Rest in peace to my car door
Let the top back all you see is gator
Bad bitch with me got my name on her
Put your put your hands up
I don't wanna play with you
Everybody just sing that song...
Bordello come i Gogol
We improve the community and human eat the banana.
We improve the community and human eat the banana.
I hope we find tomorrow
Every step was out of place
And in this world we fell from grace
Looking back we lost our way
An innocent time we all betrayed
And in time can we all learn
Not to crawl away and burn
Stand up and don't fall down
Tell you me a tell if you legalize him
Me did want a TV station so me buy that
Me did want a football team so me buy that
If me brake the law me change that
And me link up with the cream of America
So me buy left and right so my account never dry
I was born and I grew up
I was dead until the cover
I raise my head and I realize
That all my life was on a cover
Inform visitors that the museum will close in five minutes
It's too late but I won't stop
It's too late but I won't stop
It's too late but I won't stop
It's too late but I won't stop
It's too late but I won't stop
It's too late but I won't stop
It's getting late but the game ain't over
So I can take the world off my shoulders
Put it in a song and call it rock and roll
But you can feel the bass at my home in Cali
And when I see injustice I put up a fight
I don't know why different people always seem to fight
That's why we make music so the people unite but
While I'm gone you can call me
It's too late but I won't stop
It's too late but I won't stop
It's too late but I won't stop
And when I see injustice I put up a fight
I don't know why different people always seem to fight
That's why we make music so the people unite but
While I'm gone you can call me
Cause I was born a rebel and I ain't stop yet
Cause I was born a rebel and I ain't stop yet
Cause I was born a rebel and I ain't stop yet
And if you call my name
And if you call my name
And if you call my name
Prisoner 709 did the bad thing
Prisoner 709 did the bad thing
Prisoner 709 did the bad thing
Me and my Adidas we be the original
Trying to defeat us is gonna take a miracle
For 35 years they been trying to get rid of me
Now I appear hear rhyming in Italy
All the little kids are kings and queens
Positivity is all that he brings
Let it be known on every continent
I put my mind to it and accomplish it
A lot like God so praise the Lord
And if you call my name
And if you call my name
And if you call my name
And if you call my name
Even with my little shorty by my side
Burn up I'll pop and hit them by surprise
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised
This is the notorious Capone
Back to clean up all that industry bullshit
Trying to fuck my name up dog
This is for you you fucking rankers
Straight from the streets with the gangster beats
You know what's up dog
I'm on top of the streets like the California smog
They get flattened fucking with this Latin
Capone got that Chicano gangster flow
Can't stand the haters and gangster fakers
Latino Jam be some real regulators
You couldn't feel me if I was standing right on top of your back
Two turntables and a microphone
Here to collect the street respect
You're just another amateur at Night At The Apollo
I got dope on cassette and compact disc
Calling out names on all you lames
Disrespect and get shanked through your Polo sweater
Rearrange your face like Michael Jackson
Latino Jam be a big ass gang
Survivors move wise through the city
I move with that Indian hustle in me
Come through the town and it's on
Watch me get the globe with crushed weeds
Can't tell me nothing from nothing
Might throw you out of a lady jumping
They just came from war
They want to let you know a little something about where they come from
About a rap dynasty that just won't end
Hip hop was set out in the dark
The jam is dedicated to you and your boys
Yo it ain't just the music
Y'all know the place where stars is from
You must pay homage to my projects
We thorough to the end
Only jail and death divide us
From rap to the crack suppliers
I had the hood like Watts flooded wit cop force
QB to the cracks in the pavement
The streets to prison
I touch you then buck you
I just wanna get away sometimes
Ain't nobody try not to stop me when drifting through the lanes.
Bring it back up to 6th once I'm round this curve.
Once I'm cross the finish you know that it's bad time.
I don't obey when red say stop and green say go.
A factory Benz that might not beat that tricked out
We got here getting new ones
Latinos ride till we die
Whole different thing
It gets thick with the dudes and the chicks
Verna street full of gangsters and rollers
Youngsters and pee wees loading up the cannons
The only thing red on my block is a wagon
Fuck with us man you gonna see some action
All the real rap shit yo I sang that
Down in Texas we all caballeros
A story for my gangster girls
She wanna roll wit the thugs
The barrio is all she loves
She wanna hang wit the g's
Tour the big city of the 63
Brain washed the girl now she dropped out of class
She wanna roll wit the thugs
The barrio is all she loves
She wanna hang wit the g's
Tour the big city of the 63
I respect her like a queen
What we wanted to be when we both grow up
We took a cruise to the beach one time and
Said she always be my lady
Cruising down the stripe jamming oldie hits
And that's when we got in some shit damn
What goes around comes around 2 bullets to her head
She wanna roll wit the thugs
The barrio is all she loves
She wanna hang wit the g's
Tour the big city of the 63
I respect her like a queen
And that was it tried to wake her up
Now its time to face the cops and her pops
She wanna roll wit the thugs
The barrio is all she loves
She wanna hang wit the g's
Tour the big city of the 63
I respect her like a queen
She wanna roll wit the thugs
The barrio is all she loves
She wanna hang wit the g's
If you don't like it hit the highway
We doing this our way
Touching my good making sure the bastards learn
No time for fronting its nothing
Gets yours while I get mine not nothing
That's the way the world go round and round
Can't stand overpaid ass
While her man couple of a drinks
Yo money bust snaps for pocket
And I don't even iron my pants
Take your hoe to the flicks
And if she don't give you brain then you dodge the bitch
We got to travel up to Harlem where its hot as shit
Yo its Melvin the African godfather
You want to taste the revolver
Now stay motherfucker give head to the gun
It's the QB album that us bless this dun
Fully baked hand on my cock
Old heads flirting saying I resemble my pops
I'm the street in the sickest version
I buck right if my left hurting
Ducking the cops they stay searching
Now everybody tough guys
Its murder in these blood eyes
Like I ain't got shit to live for
I been on the booze hit a buck on the highway
I got O's dog for six fifties remember the name
Ain't nothing but a Queens thing baby
Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump
Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump
Do your business in person don't talk on the jack
Do know the consequences getting caught and a tap
Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump
Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump
You must abide by this
Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump
Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump
Do live by this manual consider the doctrine
Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump
Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump
And still you play the sycophant and revel in my pain
Well a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Was born to Mary and Joseph the great I am
And they sang that Christmas morning
Oh a Saviour has been born
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well a long time ago when a wise man roamed the land
They saw a shiny star above the dessert sand
Well they hopped the camels that night and rode by the pale moonlight
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well it happened a long
Oh a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
And they sang that Christmas morning
Oh a Saviour has been born
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
King Herod learned a lesson
He learned it real hard
You just don't mess with the son of God
Well a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
I said a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well the demons they cried
They moaned and wailed
The kingdom got set back on it's tail
Well a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well it happened a long
Oh a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
And they sang that Christmas morning
Oh a Saviour has been born
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
All my friends been wondering
Since I took my stand for Christ
You see they're wondering just what's in store
That's when the Lord stirs up my soul
And I quite clearly say...
Testifying child of the King
And then I'll dream about witnessing.
I'm gonna walk and talk and act like Jesus
Though I may get feathered and tarred
The expressions on their faces change
You know the looks they give are priceless
Well I'm proud to be living for Jesus
I walked into the church that night
Thought that I'd drop by the side
I laughed in spite of all my blues
It's really not the type of place
I used to hang around
I looked ahead and saw a man
And watched him close as he began to speak
And it seemed like something deep inside
Had seized my soul and though I tried
It was as though the words he said
Would echo back inside my head
I'd be a fool so I suppose
Then somehow got my self composed
I felt the blood rush through my wrist
The tighter that I squeezed my fist
Determined not to let conviction start
Then with all my wisdom left behind
I somehow saw that I was blind
Let his presence fill my heart
As everyone stepped to their feet
I managed to somehow to repeat the prayer
That they were praying
Then I dropped my head and I dropped my eyes
And suddenly I realized
Just what I was saying
Through trembling lips
I envied all those wasted years
Of dreams I'd built on sand
Unloading all my guilt and wrong
I somehow felt both weak and strong
The night I took the Master's hand
As I look back remembering
How everything just seemed different than before
How every house and bird and tree
Was strangely beautiful to me
And people were even more
How could I have been so blind
To rush through life and never find
But when I whispered Jesus name
I knew I'd never be the same
The night I took the Master's hand
But when I whispered Jesus name
I knew I'd never be the same
Who sees this strength of God inside
You just say this simple prayer with me
Well I was sharing with this sales man Lyle
So he says with a million dollar smile
Well you can't find it
That horoscope that you read is just a waste
You can't find it looking at the stars
Well my best friends Ray has got this niece
That sees within my eyes this peace
And yesterday she said
Just talk with Jesus on your knees
Brother you can't find it
Or even when you pop a pill or two
You can't find it smoking dope or weed
Cause one fine day you're gonna see
That the dope that's being smoked my friend is you
Well if you're depressed
Why not try the Lord for goodness sake
Sin had left it's brand upon my life
I was only a shadow of what I could be
I truly doubted that God was alive
That's when the light of mercy was revealed to me
Then You caressed my shattered world
And healed my wounded spirit
So that I could stand
I know what life is for
My greatest efforts just to break away
Fell short of every goal
I had not anything left but to pray
And in my darkest hour
Then You caressed my shattered world
And healed my wounded spirit
So that I could stand
I know what life is for
I woke up late on my kitchen floor
From partying last night again
I had to face the day with a head of pain
I fumbled around with my TV set
To catch a flick and try to forget
I turned on this black evangelist
Who preached the word with a funky twist
His choir moved then sang and shout
I hoped in my car went to check it out
As I approached the door
There was a big soul brother around 6 foot 4
Who reached out to shake with a smile of love
And a hand as big as a boxing glove
He looked in my eyes to my soul inside
Then he said these words
Free from the power of sin.
What I saw I just nearly lost my breath
The choir swaying to and fro
While they sang about the battle of Jericho
A preacher man in a three piece with two toned shoes and a tie to boot
He said God sent his only son to say us from the evil one
If you're not born again don't stall
Come down when I give the alter call
Well I felt my feet shuffle down the aisle
While sinners marched down single file
And something drove me to my knees
With my hands held high I began to cry
And I said these words out loud
Free from the power of sin.
Because there's a price to be paid
We're constantly dying
While new foundations are laid
While we are building our faith
Sufficiently he gives his grace
I'm learning dependency
Only so I can be healed
And over and over I'm learning
To put my trust in you
Over and over I'm learning
What child like faith can do
Over and over it's easy to see
Just how you're spirit is working in me
As I grow older I'm learning over
Because I am bearing the name of Christian
I'm conscious of what people see
The only bible they may every read
Is what they will read through me
Oh use my oh God all you can
I'll go where you lead me
While holding so tightly your hand
And over and over I'm learning
To put my trust in you
Over and over I'm learning
What child like faith can do
Over and over it's easy to see
Just how you're spirit is working in me
As I grow older I'm learning over
As I grow older I'm still learning over
I'm gonna get all my friends together
Listen to what I have to say
I declare I've never felt this way
Can't hold it inside no more
The gift of eternal life is free
Washed in the blood of the Lamb
All my sins have been forgiven
And I am just now starting to live
And I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb
Well I've been washed in the blood
Washed in the blood of the Lamb
All my sins have been forgiven
And I'm on my way to heaven
I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb
Jesus died on the cross
For all the sins of fallen man
Because without the shedding of his blood
There is no remission for our sins
Don't let that evil confine you
You need to be set free
From those sins that would bind you
I've been washed in the blood
Washed in the blood of the Lamb
All my sins have been forgiven
And I am just now starting to live
Well I've been washed in the blood
Washed in the blood of the Lamb
All my sins have been forgiven
And I'm on my way to heaven
They looked so sincere with their white shirts and ties
As they tried to sell me their religion.
We talked for awhile as my eggs got cold
They said they were convinced by what they'd been taught
That God's just an exalted man like you and me.
They proceeded to tell me He's got hair
And in Daniel God's finger wrote on the wall
And His watchful eye is mentioned everywhere
The Psalms say He'll protect us with His feathers and His wings
And he proved his own divinity when he rose up from the dead
The Book of John says he's The Word of God come in the flesh
Well he's the author of salvation and he leaves no room to guess
He's the first and he's the last
So if you're still confused I've no words left to waste
I was flying out to Dallas
You come back in the form of a cow or bird or fly
You can't even go out and eat a Big Mac
And he proved his own divinity when he rose up from the dead
The Book of John says he's The Word of God come in the flesh
Well he's the author of salvation and he leaves no room to guess
He's the first and he's the last
So if you're still confused I've no words left to waste
Your spirit has raised me
And helped me to grow
Showing and teaching me things I should know
And you never gave up LORD
Your face never turned
But you strove with your servant
Lord I'm willing and I'm able to climb
That mountain before me
I so need your hand in mine
And no matter the cost Lord
And I'll learn every lesson
I'm humbled and still
For righting my wrong
Your spirit Your spirit
Will sooth all the pain
I praise you again and again
Lord without you I'm nothing
That you died on that cross
You showed me your mercy
And your love without end
It just makes me want to praise you
For righting my wrong
Your spirit Your spirit
Will sooth all the pain
I praise you again and again
For righting my wrong
Your spirit Your spirit
Will sooth all the pain
He was halfway through a meatball when the Lord spoke
And they listened intently to him
He just wants your faith and trust in Him
Little David must have just been in his teens
When he faced Goliath of the Philistines
He was armed with just a slingshot and some stones
Well Goliath was a giant and strong as a tank
And there stood little David all alone
With faith in God he slung his sling
And much to their surprise
He killed that monster with a stone
Then decapitated his fallen foe
And made sure he was dead
And showed everyone there he was someone
King David was smitten down to his socks
When his eyes caught that Bathsheba fox
His resistance was so shook that he backslid
He went and had her husband killed
The Lord punished him severe
But David's faith was strong
And God soon pulled him back in shape
Now there's a lesson to be learned here
About dealing with temptation
Call thy walls salvation
Call thy gates praised
There'll be no moon to light the nights
No sun to light the days
For God shall be thy glory
The Lord shall reign forever
In power and in might
Beginning and The End
The Word who reigns forever
His people shall be righteous
They shall posses this land
The branches of his plantings
And the works of his hands
For from a small beginning
A mighty nation grows
And in the fullness of his time
The whole wide world will know
That His name is still Yahweh
Beginning and The End
The Word who reigns forever
The demons were planning on having a party one night.
Ready to blow a fuse.
To the toes of his pointy shoes.
And I'll catch you la... la...

And not on His creation
Bless the name of Jesus
Praise the name of Jesus
Sing unto the King of Israel
Glory to His name forever
And some say He's just history.
Blessed Prince of Peace.
Some named Him devil because of His powers
To accept Him as more than just a man.
Blessed Prince of Peace.
I woke up Monday morning
I went down to McDonald's
Still asleep yet wide awake
When this loudmouth pushy businessman
But then the spirit stopped me
When I saw how it stood
The holy ghost reminded me
And it would be hard to witness to him
Stretched out on the floor
But Jesus says to crucify it
And I was fighting with temptation
I was dueling with that thing
Is all that it will bring
Put on the Mind of Christ
I thought I'd take a cruise
And catch some rays down by the ocean
I had it all planned out
To roast some burgers and some wienies
Was dressed up in bikinis
I knew that there must be a way to please the Lord and still get tan
I always hear My children when they bow to pray
I never fail to entertain all that they say
I mourn with every sorrow
I grieve with every pain
Yet all the while I'm strengthening and blessing them again
I want so much to be their Source from which they feed
For I and only I can give them what they need
That's why within the pages of My Written Word
Time and time again this simple line is often heard
In that dry and thirsty world you live in
I'll be your cup of water if only you give in
All of the things that I preferred
For those that love Me
But only if you ask of Me
In that dry and thirsty world you live in
I'll be your cup of water if only you give in
Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord
Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord
They took the palm leaves from the trees and laid
Emanuel the Chosen One has finally arrived
The way you mess me around
You accused my brethren of sins forgiven
That kicked them when they're down
You tried and you lost to be my boss
With your sickness and pain and your hell bound train
Your cheating and your lying tongue too
I want to make this very clear to you
In the name of Jesus Christ
If you're gonna try to attack
The Lord in the front and in the back
I am the resurrection and the Life
A certain man had died
In the town of Bethany
And Lazarus was his name
The Bible says he was
A man that Jesus loved
And his sisters thought
Mary and Martha longed
For Jesus healing touch
To come and raise their brother
But Jesus had a plan not known to any man
That would soon take away their pain
They was waiting for Jesus
When he died he went to where
The saints of God did stay
They lived beyond the tomb
And all the others jammed up in a room
He turned around and saw
He walked up and said hey brother
What's this group here for
Well all right this is testimony night
Have a seat man cause
The meeting is starting soon
While Mary and Martha
Moses shook his stick
Said now this meeting come to order
Abraham kicked it off
Said I want y'all know
He gave a child to my barren wife
Isaac waived his hand said
Hey daddy I knew him too
Old dignified Solomon
Adjusted his robe and said
I started to teach it
Ezekiel said I knew him
As a wheel within a wheel
Job said man he healed me
When I was almost dead
Sampson said I knew him
When some Philistines tried to jump me
I took a donkey jawbone and busted a few heads
We knew him in the fiery furnace
Jonah said man he gave me a second chance
Daniel cried out I knew him
In a hungry den of lions
The Holy Ghost hit King David
He just started to dance
Lazarus got so excited
He shouted Hey I knew him too
Moses put down his stick
Said hey who's the new kid
Needless to say the room got real quiet
When Lazarus said But I knew him
In a way you all never did
You see man I walked with him and talked with him
I saw how his teachings awed the crowds
Those famous tears of compassion I could actually see
He used to come over to my house after church
And my sisters would make him dinner
And every month I even supported his ministry
You see man I watched him confront the Pharisees
I was there when he fed the five thousand
I heard the people gasp when he healed the lame
You see man I even remember the littlest things
The things that most folks would forget
Up at the grave stone rolled away
You see it just seems like yesterday
I could hear that man saying my name
As a matter of a fact it seemed like today
Excuse me brothers I think I hear him calling me now
Like he was saying sickness be healed
Mary don't weep Martha don't moan
Maybe you held your walk on this shelf
And you've lost some ground
You've fallen again and you feel so condemned
Till it's brought you down
If your sin has dimmed the spirit's light
There's forgiveness through the blood of Christ
He'll restore your torn and shattered life
That's the reason I can say
That my spirit's at rest
Though troubles won't cease
Yet my mind is at peace
With all that is in me
That His mercy endures forever
His mercy endures forever
I am the resurrection and the Life

Someone has to walk this gospel of peace throughout our nations. Our TV game shows won't clear out our jails.
Well I walked down to my local A of G
To look around and see what I could see
I heard somebody shout spun myself about
Running straight towards me
He looked up at me and said
You may not understand
Why we shout and raise our hands
It's only because this thing is real
Frightened in the back row there I sat
I must admit I was nervous as a cat
I felt the Spirit's groove
The Holy Ghost done showed me there
You may not understand
Why we shout and raise our hands
It's only because this thing is real
Let me tell you what it feels like
It's just like fire shut up in my bones
You may not understand
Why we shout and raise our hands
It's only because this thing is real
Into the valley of the war
To face the giant who threatened God's people
Clad in the armor of the LORD
Those around him doubted any kind of victory
Even before it all began
Then the giant looked down
And laughed in David's face
The power of Death is within my command
I can bury you right where you stand
My threats have been intimidating people now for years
And a holy anger drilled him
And it shot right through the fibers of his spirit like a beam
I've got a message from the God of whom you have defied
You come against me with your weapons from Hell
You come against me with your fearful evil spell
But I come against you in the name of the God of the armies of Israel
Into the valley of our war
To face the giant who threatens God's people
Clad in the armor of the LORD
Those around us doubt any kind of victory
Even before it all began
Then our giant looks down and laughs in our face
The power of Death is within my command
I can bury you right where you stand
My threats have been intimidating people now for years
And a holy anger will drill you
And it will shoot right through the fibers of your spirit like a beam
I've got a message from the God of whom you have defied
You come against me with your weapons from Hell
You come against me with your fearful evil spell
But I come against you in the name of the God of the armies of Israel
You come against me with your weapons from Hell
You come against me with your fearful evil spell
But I come against you in the name of the God of the armies of Israel
Yet I hear the sound of the abundance of rain.
Yet I hear the sound of the abundance of rain.
We've turned from Your ways
We lack the power we once knew in our prayers
That gentle voice from heaven
We cease to hear and know
The fact that He has risen no longer stirs our soul
And cleanse us from our impurities
And revive us oh Lord
Though we've been unfaithful
We have never been disowned
The spirit that raised Christ from the dead
And cleanse us from our impurities
And cleanse us from our impurities
His witness could have been more than it had.
Somehow it's got to end.
I wanna see me some...
A little bit more conviction.
I wanna see me some...
A little bit more conviction.
A little bit more conviction.
I wanna see me some...
I know Jesus lives inside of me and answers when I pray.
The destination is there.
The destination is there.
The destination is there.
In myself I failed the Lord
Then was afraid to try once more
That fire in my soul had fled
My Spirit gives the strength you need
To raise you up and to succeed
And for vision in the night
To you I'll give these words of light
For what belongs to Me
Discouragement is all you'll find
Don't watch the waves that roll the sea
Just focus your eyes on Me
And I will make you strong and then
Your shattered courage I will mend
And if you fall and should get hurt
For what belongs to Me
Without one thing it's all in vain.
And love can help us like each other and love the only you that God has made.
Without one thing it's all in vain.
God's love can help us like each other and love the only you that God has made.
The symbol of a spirit war
A cosmic coliseum would host the end
Who will decide who forever will be the Champion.
The angels came in splendor from a star.
Tormented and vexed and grieved.
Waiting for their judgment From the Throne.
The demons reeled in pain as a swell of power like silent thunder rolled
In resplendent glory appeared the Son of God.
God the Father will oversee the duel.
And the devil leaped in fury.
With all his evil tricks he came undone.
He threw his jabs of hate and lust.
A stab of pride and envy but the hand that knew no sin blocked every one.
Now the final blow saved for the final round.
Prophetically Christ's hands came down
The blow of death felled Jesus to the ground.
The saints shocked and perplexed as wounds appeared upon His hands and feet.
And they waited for the 10 count of defeat.
The 10 count would proclaim the battle's end.
His eyes are moving...
His fingers are twitching...
Through endless ages and beyond
Let it be voiced from mountains loud and strong
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head.
And stay by His cradle till morning is nigh.
And fit us for heaven to live with Thee there.
And stay by His cradle till morning is nigh.
Keeping watch over their flock by night
And the glory of the Lord shone around them
And they were greatly afraid
For unto You is born this day
For unto You is born this day
And this shall be a sign to know
A baby wrapped in swaddling clothes
Lying in the manger lo
For unto You is born this day
For unto You is born this day
And this shall be a sign to know
A baby wrapped in swaddling clothes
He will be lying in a manger lo
For unto a child is born
Unto us a Son is given
And the government will be upon His shoulder
And His name will be called
Of the increase of his government and peace
Upon the throne of David and over his kingdom
To order it and establish it
With judgment and justice
From that time forward and even forevermore
And the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this
And this shall be a sign to know
A baby wrapped in swaddling clothes
He will be lying in a manger lo
And this shall be a sign to know
A baby wrapped in swaddling clothes
He will be lying in a manger lo
For unto You is born this day
Unto You is born this day
I feel Jesus I feel Jesus
I feel Jesus In this place
Yes my soul does Burn within me
I feel Jesus In this place
There's a peaceful breeze of heaven in the air
There's a gentle flow of music everywhere
Something whispers all is well
And assures me child fear not
There's a swell of love overtaking me
And I know it's the presence of God
I feel Jesus in the place
Yes my soul does Burn within me
Our Blessed Savior has come
The verdict delivered for salvation's plan.
The Rock of Ages will soon be made flesh.
The time that was chosen by God's perfect will
The hour appointed has now begun
Praising and magnifying His name.
The shepherds heard from the hill
With love never greater to this world He gave
His only begotten that we might be saved.
Praising and magnifying His name.
The shepherds heard from the hill
The shepherds stood gazing in fear.
Praising and magnifying His name.
Why lies He in such mean estate
The silent Word is pleading.
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
Nails and spear shall pierce Him through
Why lies He in such mean estate
Well a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Was born to Mary and Joseph the great I am
And they sang that Christmas morning
Oh a Saviour has been born
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well a long time ago when a wise man roamed the land
They saw a shiny star above the dessert sand
Well they hopped the camels that night and rode by the pale moonlight
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well it happened a long
Oh a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
And they sang that Christmas morning
Oh a Saviour has been born
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
King Herod learned a lesson
He learned it real hard
You just don't mess with the son of God
Well a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
I said a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well the demons they cried
They moaned and wailed
The kingdom got set back on it's tail
Well a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well it happened a long
Oh a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
And they sang that Christmas morning
Oh a Saviour has been born
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
By the hand of the Lord
That Jesus Christ is Lord of all.
Let the church arise.
Jesus Christ is Lord and God's still on the throne.
The world thinks I'm crazy.
You gotta come out from among the rest.
You gotta tell the gospel tale.
The only thing that's gonna change this world is the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Wimpy saints won't survive in spiritual warfare.
On the inside we now stand.
I believe that on the third day Jesus rose from the grave.
The world thinks we're crazy.
Our friends thinks we are crazy.
Our family thinks we're crazy.
We are the children of the King
We're not afraid to let our voices ring
Christ is our salvation
He's the light that shines
We are a chosen generation
Of the gospel or his name
Holy hands are lifted high
To the name of Jesus Christ
There's many voices in the wind
But only one that frees the soul from sin
Do you know Christ is still the answer
There is no other name so given
Unto a fallen man that he might be saved
Now we survive on the immoral lives
So they keep on with their Search for Tomorrow
There remains a blessed hope for you
With an end to marital strife
We must live for Jesus Christ
The Only Guiding Light
In the stillness of my soul
And moved inside of me.
One voice of praise to Thee.
And I thank You for the faithfulness
You've shown down through the years.
One voice of praise to Thee.
One voice of praise to Thee.
Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the
Children of Israel... None went out and none came in.
Surrounded by walls so thick the chariots raced on top.
And blazing in the sun
The armies of Israel stood waiting for commands of
And it was Joshua who led nearly three million
Israelites into the Promised Land.
Setting at our disposal weaponry that drops
Something with tremendous power that
When David played his songs of praise demons fled from Saul...
The shout of victory binds the devil with chains that
Day they marched seven.
They looked fear dead in the face.
They prepared their souls for victory...
They'd screamed their lungs out simply because
And Israel shouted in victory... and they shouted in
How many know the anointing breaks the yokes of
The devil's tormented sickness can't function when
We worship and when we pray...
Now how many here within the sound of my voice
Are you ready to tear down walls that have held
Are you ready to let some strongholds fall that have
Then in the name of Jesus Christ I challenge you
Tonight and I dare you...
And trials you've been in...
To leap to your feet right now and make a joyful
I feel Jesus I feel Jesus
I feel Jesus In this place
Yes my soul does Burn within me
I feel Jesus In this place
There's a peaceful breeze of heaven in the air
There's a gentle flow of music everywhere
Something whispers all is well
And assures me child fear not
There's a swell of love overtaking me
And I know it's the presence of God
I feel Jesus in the place
Yes my soul does Burn within me
Joel prophesied that in the end
The Holy Spirit would be poured out on all men
Lord of all the Land and Sea
Lord of all the earth
Lord of all the land and sea
Lord of all the earth
Lord of all the land and sea
Lord of all the earth
The spirit of Jesus is living in me
The Holy Spirit the world cannot see
Praise the Lord our God
Praise the Lord our God
Praise the Lord our God
Praise the Lord our God
Praise the Lord our God
But I tell you most of all
Will go where He sends me
For he's there wherever we roam
But I tell you most of all
I need You more than ever now
I need You more than ever now
I need You more today than
When I first believed
I need You more than ever now
Jesus preached to His crew
Said boys the promise of the Father
Is coming soon to you
For John baptized with water
Y'all thought that was the most
I'm gonna tell you in a little while
You're gonna be baptized in the Holy Ghost
Now all the brothers got together
In the Upper Room saying oh yes
Somebody say we're gonna have
Whatever that is oh Lord
John the beloved was hugging everybody
And kind of talking to himself out loud
Peter said I hope this promise hurries
Cause I got stuff to do
And my newsletter's overdue
We've been in one accord praying for days
And I know that mushy John the beloved
He gonna start hugging me again
You see as long as I've known Jesus
He's been blowing people's minds
I've seen Him cleanse lepers
Change water into wine
I've seen Him heal diseases with no known cure
To straighten out my life when Jesus saw she was dying
You see He's walked on the water
Calm the wind and the waves
Call that dead boy Lazarus
As far as anything supernatural. I can't imagine what else this Man can do
Somebody wanna close the window
Hey we ain't got no windows up here
About you all praying now
This is the Upper Room
We're suppose to be cool man
We're not drunk as you suppose
We're just filled with The Holy Ghost
We're not drunk as you suppose
We're just filled with The Holy Ghost
Joel prophesied that in the end
The Holy Spirit would be poured out on all men
He's moving on all flesh
Soldiers of the cross
And children of the light
Warriors of righteousness with healing in their hands
God's got an army marching through the lands
Let me hear you war cry hay
Let me hear you war cry hay
With ears to hear and hearts to respond
To spiritual needs of the nation
We're a showcase of what he'll do when we are strong
In Jesus to a whole generation
The world won't be the same tomorrow
Because we are here today
The kingdom of hell is gonna feel sorrow
Because our war cry is worship and praise
Soldiers of the cross
And children of the light
Warriors of righteousness with healing in their hands
God's got an army marching through the lands
Let me hear you war cry hay
Let me hear you war cry hay
The apostles and profits are speaking forth
Flames of revival they are burning
Like old Joshua went marching out to possess
There's no way our minds will be turning
There joy in the battle so we commence
To change this nation's course
The kingdom of God suffering violence
Not afraid to fight soldiers of the cross
And children of the light
Warriors of righteousness with healing in their hands
God's got an army marching through the lands
We're not afraid to stand and fight
We cast out demons left and right
We're strong in battle strong in prayer
We tell Satan get out of here
Help me make a joyful sound
Help me make a joyful noise
Come on gimme a shout of victory
Cast off the spirit of worry and doubt
Lift your praises to the sky
We're gonna get down with some church tonight
We gonna dance and we gonna shout
We gonna turn this whole place inside out
Come on gimme a shout of victory
Cast off the spirit of worry and doubt
I get joy when I think about
As his flesh just hung like rivets
As his face they punched and smacked
All the splinters from the criss crossed beam dug deep into his back
When he did some blood splattered
The prophet looked and said
And as they dropped the cross in the hole they dug
His body convulsed with pain
Through the agony and torment
That never a soul shall find
He tilts his face towards heaven
With full control of his mind
With more love then any human heard
Before that time or since
He made a statement that to this day
And as he gave his life for those lost in sin
The Atoning cleansing blood of the Lamb
As his flesh just hung like rivets
As his face they punched and smacked
All the splinters from the criss crossed beam dug deep into his back
When he did some blood splattered
The prophet looked and said
And as they dropped the cross in the hole they dug
His body convulsed with pain
Through the agony and torment
That never a soul shall find
He tilts his face towards heaven
With full control of his mind
With more love then any human heard
Before that time or since
He made a statement that to this day
And as he gave his life for those lost in sin
The Atoning cleansing blood of the Lamb
By the blood of the Lamb
All my sins are washed away
You can talk about me
All my sins are washed away
I've been to the river
And I've been baptized
All my sins are washed away
All my sins are washed away
I love Jesus yes I do
I love Jesus how about you
The bottom line the way to win
Is up with Jesus down with sin
Only Christ can set you free
Christ can set you free
I love Jesus yes I do
For the sentence of destruction's on the forehead of the devil.
Revival is coming to our land
The Holy Ghost is moving just like a hurricane
Revival is coming to our shore
Get ready for the moving of the Spirit of the Lord
It's what we've been waiting for
It's what we've been praying for
From America to England
The Spirit of God is being poured out
On all flesh and there is
They wouldn't let children pray in school
Violent crime began to rise
The grades went down and the kids got high
Today no one knows right from wrong
There's blood on people's hands
Now stand back and see
That it's our turn now
We're gonna bind the devil
When the gates of hell come crashing down
And you begin to see the church arise
With the Ten Commandments on their wall
God's Word in the library won't appear
We have a religious apartheid here
Our consciences have died
We need to seek our God and call His name
We're gonna turn the tide
That it's our turn now
We're gonna bind the devil
When the gates of hell come crashing down
And you begin to see the church arise
We're gonna bind that devil
When the gates of hell come crashing down
You begin to see the church arise
To See those gates of hell crash down
Everybody used to do the twist
The mashed potato and it moves like this
Wasn't nothing they would not do
But there's a new dance no one can stop
A leap for joy we call the Holy Ghost hop
Give the Holy Ghost control now
Rejoice with a grateful heart
Rejoice to the Holy One
Everybody praise Him and rejoice
Hey all you brothers and your sisters too
Don't let tradition tell you what to do
Release your worries and your fears
If King David was here I know that he
Would do the Holy Ghost hop with me
Give the Holy Ghost control now
Rejoice with a grateful heart
Rejoice to the Holy One
I'll magnify You and I will love You
With all of my heart and my soul and my mind
It's time to have some fun now
Rejoice with a grateful heart
Rejoice to the Holy One
Everybody praise Him and rejoice
Let your praises fill the air
Everybody praise Him and rejoice
With a grateful heart rejoice
And he's broken every law
He's terrorized the lives
Of men and he's under arrest
Because I've been sent
With a warrant from the body of Christ
Through Jesus Christ so I talk to you demons like dogs
I command you to appear
I can feel your fear from here
A praying church wants you to know
Your kingdom's gonna fall
Whole new breed of Christian of today
And I'm authorized and
Deputized to blow you clean away
I've got a message to
Deliver from One who's true and just
Take you out by the Spirit and the Word
One by one you'll drop
Like flies under foot and in the ground
Because greater is He who is in me
You'll be the first to go
There's deliverance from you
You ain't welcome here no more
We lay hands on the sick
You've preyed on minds so simple
I'm gonna hit you where it hurts
My family and I'm tired
I'm a Holy Ghost filled man
Your eternal destruction
Whole new breed of Christian of today
And I'm authorized and
Deputized to blow you clean away
I've got a weapon with
Two bullets that overcome all sin and crud
And the other one's called The Blood
The time was 1955 a meal was 40 cents
A Cadillac was the car to drive and Ike was president
Were Holy Ghost electrified by wild evangelists
But nothing could compare
Or none took you quite as high
As being at the tent and hearing people testify
Once all this had ended up to the microphone
With a furnace in his eyes and no time left to play
This human locomotive right there began to say
I believe in a God that sets the captives free
I believe in the blood that flows from Calvary
I'm so glad that the Lord saved me
I'm so glad that the Lord saved me
The power of God was on these men to set those captives free.
But nothing could compare
Or none took you quite as high
As being at the tent and hearing people testify
Woke up with my mind stayed on Jesus and I've been praising Him all day long
Once all this had ended up to the microphone
This human locomotive right there began to say
I'm so glad that the Lord saved me
I'm so glad that the Lord saved me
I'm so glad that the Lord saved me.
I'm so glad that the Lord saved me
I'm so glad that the Lord saved me
I'm so glad that the Lord saved me
There's a silent war that's raging deep within me
My lower nature fights to dominate
My spirit man is poised and locked in battle
With the carnal side of me I've grown to hate.
The trumpet of my prayers plays toward Heaven
A voice of desperation in my cry
But keep Your righteous banner lifted high.
And I thirst for the righteousness that's Yours
That my mind would be cleansed
And my spirit renewed
And this temple that You dwell in would be pure.
The tempter stalks about me as a lion
Searching for the slightest scent of blood
For when the skin of my resistance is broken
He moves in swiftly to deepen the cut.
You understand the weaknesses of man.
I'm counting myself crucified with Jesus
Alive to Christ and dead indeed to sin.
And I thirst for the righteousness that's Yours
That my mind would be cleansed
And my spirit renewed
Let me kick a little slang
I'll tell you all about
Where we power people
With power over demons
We've trained our brains
To know Christ is the
The power of praise can
You've been spurned and
Burned by a life with no
Bust out of prison with
The risen life Saviour
I've got news you can
Without Christ you lose
But if you jam with the
Amputation situation first
Come rock with the flock
With the brothers that
Let me take you to school
People get addicted to new things everyday
But I'll stand with the man who made the blind to see
People they go crazy and don't know when to stop
Drug and crack and heart attack and what do you lose
From top to the very bottom of the list
So don't gimme the fist on addiction
To Christ who paid the price
Died on the cross as a sacrifice for our sin
Me and my boys are addicted to Him
Praise the Lord with your feet
Praise the Lord with your feet
You're life's with God
I was still aware of those around me
I could hear their cries and sense their grief
But was physically incapable
Of responding to them in any way
There was surprisingly no sensation of death
As my spirit and body naturally
And without effort began to separate
An entirely new dimension of reality unfolded
Like the slow opening of a rare flower
Celestial mysteries were revealed from beyond
The atmosphere was permeated
With the healing melody of an invisible choir
And I knew I had entered the domain of the living God
My eyes beheld a vast concourse of souls from every nation
Dressed in the spotless garments of the redeemed
With a loud voice they echoed praises to their King
I saw a mighty throne around which was seated
Four and twenty elders with crowns of glory
And like the sound of rushing waters they began to sing
The whole principle of living was different
Food and water wasn't needed to sustain life
Source of tears or any physical pain
Light did not come from one source like the sun
But God's glory illuminated everything
Suspended like a cube at the expanse of eternity
Fifteen hundred miles high and just as deep as it was wide
Indescribable colors were refracting everywhere
From the precious stones it was made of
With twelve angels guarding the gates
Fashioned from one solid pearl on each side
Of one whose virtue shot through the very fibers of my being
His silhouette was backdropped by the immense sea of glass
And for the very first time
My eyes beheld one altogether lovely
I threw up my hands and cried
His eyes were filled with tenderness
His countenance proclaimed He knew everything
There was to know or ever worth knowing
Being with Him was to have everything I ever wanted
Be everything I ever imagined
And arrive at everywhere I only dreamed of going
Then the same Voice that spoke the worlds into existence
Spoke my name in affectionate tones
Who are deeply grieved at your death
They've prayed I return you to your earthly life
And because of their faithfulness to Me
The limitless wonders of Heaven
If they could steal but one brief glimpse of glory
That I return to the confines of my human body
For You are the resurrection of the life
The Son of the Living God
You're the only one worthy of honor
And glory and power and praise
I'll join the hosts of heaven
Lord of all the Earth
Forever He shall reign
Lord of all the Earth
Forever He shall reign
I was still aware of those around me
I could hear their cries and sense their grief
But was physically incapable
Of responding to them in any way

I feel Jesus I feel Jesus
I feel Jesus In this place
Yes my soul does Burn within me
I feel Jesus In this place
There's a peaceful breeze of heaven in the air
There's a gentle flow of music everywhere
Something whispers all is well
And assures me child fear not
There's a swell of love overtaking me
And I know it's the presence of God
I feel Jesus in the place
Yes my soul does Burn within me
By the hand of the Lord
That Jesus Christ is Lord of all.
Let the church arise.
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
By the blood of the Lamb
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
To the Holy One who sits high upon the throne
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
By the blood of the Lamb
Got our orders ready to fight
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
By the blood of the Lamb
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
Help me make a joyful sound
Help me make a joyful noise
Come on gimme a shout of victory
Cast off the spirit of worry and doubt
Lift your praises to the sky
We're gonna get down with some church tonight
We gonna dance and we gonna shout
We gonna turn this whole place inside out
Come on gimme a shout of victory
Cast off the spirit of worry and doubt
I get joy when I think about
Let me kick a little slang
I'll tell you all about
Where we power people
With power over demons
We've trained our brains
To know Christ is the
The power of praise can
You've been spurned and
Burned by a life with no
Bust out of prison with
The risen life Saviour
I've got news you can
Without Christ you lose
But if you jam with the
Amputation situation first
Come rock with the flock
With the brothers that
I always hear My children when they bow to pray
I never fail to entertain all that they say
I mourn with every sorrow
I grieve with every pain
Yet all the while I'm strengthening and blessing them again
I want so much to be their Source from which they feed
For I and only I can give them what they need
That's why within the pages of My Written Word
Time and time again this simple line is often heard
In that dry and thirsty world you live in
I'll be your cup of water if only you give in
All of the things that I preferred
For those that love Me
But only if you ask of Me
In that dry and thirsty world you live in
I'll be your cup of water if only you give in
In myself I failed the Lord
Then was afraid to try once more
That fire in my soul had fled
My Spirit gives the strength you need
To raise you up and to succeed
And for vision in the night
To you I'll give these words of light
For what belongs to Me
Discouragement is all you'll find
Don't watch the waves that roll the sea
Just focus your eyes on Me
And I will make you strong and then
Your shattered courage I will mend
And if you fall and should get hurt
For what belongs to Me
Abraham refused to say his life was done
When he was a hundred
Abe went and had a son
Moses snatched the Israelites
Into the Promised Land
Can be a hero in God's world
Hall of Faith. Hall of Faith.
Hall of Faith. Hall of Faith.
A boy named David faced Goliath with a sling
That same little boy became a great and mighty king
Even in the lion's den
And Dan walked out again
Can be a hero in God's world
Hall of Faith. Hall of Faith.
Hall of Faith. Hall of Faith.
Can be a hero in God's world
David was a little shepherd boy
David wasn't scared of a thing
One day David went down to the battlefield
Gonna have a little talk with the king.
Dave we got a little problem here
Nobody wasn't looking
Cause nobody didn't care
David came down to the battlefield
But I'll drop you where you stand.
So David went out to face Goliath with only a sling and a stone. He put it above his head and whirled it...
Right now things don't seem to go your way
You think you won't see a brighter day
Your Heavenly Father wants to soothe your troubled mind
I believe somewhere within the night the littlest light shines through
I know that somewhere within the heart of God there's a place for you
Sometimes hearts cry but when your hope is dead
You must remember all the things that Jesus said
I believe somewhere within the night the littlest light shines through
I know that somewhere within the heart of God there's a place for you
Never doubt his heart of love for you
I believe somewhere within the night the littlest light shines through
The ocean is a scary place to go for a stroll
Especially when the skies are dark and waves begin to roll
Peter walked on the water
Faith stepped out on the sea
The world can be a scary place to go for a stroll
Especially when the winds of life make you lose control
But you can walk on the water though difficult it may seem
Trust the Word of God
The next wave holds a miracle
Peter walked on the water
Faith stepped out on the sea
Born... born... born... born... born... born
He was a born to a virgin named Mary on Christmas Day
He bled and he died on the cross to take sin away
Jesus Christ is in the house today
The way is straight and narrow
And few there be that find it today
But there's an angle in the tangle
The solution to pollution of the mind
For two thousand years it's still
You must be born again
Jesus Christ is in the house today
Jesus... You go to Jesus
Jesus... His name is Jesus
Jesus... He's hope for the hopeless
Jesus... The holy one
Jesus... Friend to the friendless
Jesus... God's only son
Jesus... Bread for the hungry
Jesus... For every man
Jesus... For all creation
Jesus Christ is in the house
Here is the jam going cross the land
And a jam that I think you know
It's a groove on the move and a groove you've heard from the Word called the 1-5-0
It's all about praise when the big band plays
And it makes the saints go wild
Bring the glory down with the trumpet sound
With the harp and the lyre everyone can hear
And the people clap their hands
The spirit's right and with all their might
Everyone starts to dance
God is a God of righteousness
God sits on the throne
God is strong in battle
God is wise and merciful
God is sovereign Lord
God reigns forevermore
Ruler over everything
Honor and glory to His Name
God holds up the universe
God sustains the soul
God exalts and God puts down
God's glory is eternal
God is love and grace
Blessing and glory and wisdom
Thanksgiving and honor and power and might
Be to our God forever and ever
And all the saints said
There's a growing root of bitterness
From the heart of Johannesburg
A swelling violent undertow
Has gripped the soul of man
But an integrated cry of hope
Echoes across the land
I hear my brothers say
To let the love of Jesus
Every tongue and every race
All of God's children seek His face
People of promise take your place
Tell of His mercy and His grace
Lift up your voice to the sky
All of God's children testify
We worship You because You are Lord and King
We magnify You because You are the One who reigns
We glorify You because You always remain the same
We worship You because You are Lord and King
We magnify You because You are the One who reigns
We glorify You because You always remain the same
We got no time for hit and miss
The world is full of prejudice
Everybody praise the Lord
He inhabits our praises
Everybody praise the Lord
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter where you've been
It doesn't matter what the scar
It doesn't matter what the sin
It doesn't matter how you fell
Somewhere along the way
There is healing for your life today
From the fountain of God
And it heals everything along the way
I have tasted and know
That for every broken heart
He looks beyond how far you've gone
He looks beyond when you were hurt
He looks beyond who stole your song
He looks beyond what made it worse
He looks beyond where others failed
To reach out to you and say
There's healing for your life today
It's a river that loves
It's a river that lives
It's the river of life
Living water it gives
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
By the blood of the Lamb
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
To the Holy One who sits high upon the throne
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
By the blood of the Lamb
Got our orders ready to fight
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
By the blood of the Lamb
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
I'll teach your head how to spread salvation to the nation
Love the Lord with all your heart and mind and soul and strength
To really break it down just repeat these words of mine
Only Christ can set you free
Hide the Word in your heart
When you grow you won't depart
Grind the devil to the ground
They said I'd never make it
They said I would not last a day
They said when things got heated up
I would get blown away
But I'm still here Lord
I got strength to stand
They said I was too fragile
They said I didn't have the stuff
To try and swim up stream
But I'm still here Lord
I got strength to stand
I walk by faith and not by sight
His power is available only for the asking
I got strength to stand
I got strength to stand
Like the flowers love the sun that shines
Like the willow loves the rain
Like a sparrow loves the summer skies
My love for you Lord's the same
Like a mother loves her baby's sigh
Like the ocean loves the shore
Like the heavens love the stars at night
With every passing day I'm sure
Completely and forever more
Could I really tell You how I feel
Could I ever find a way
Could the words I offer You reveal
With every passing day I'm sure
Completely and forever more
With every passing day I'm sure
Completely and forever more
I thank You that You brought me through the fire and the flood
I thank You for the change in me
With every passing day I'm sure
Completely and forever more
With every passing day I'm sure
Completely and forever more
With every passing day I'm sure
Completely and forever more
With every passing day I'm sure
Names synonymous with the spirit of our country
Over 200 years ago they shook off the chains of tyranny from Great Britain
Citing 27 biblical violations they wrote the Declaration of Independence
With liberty and justice for all
But something happened since Jefferson called the Bible the cornerstone
For American liberty then put it in our schools as a light
Our country was founded on the Gospel of Jesus Christ
We eliminated God from the equation of American life
Thus eliminating the reason this nation first began
From beyond the grave I hear the voices of our founding fathers plead
You need God in America again
Of the 55 men who formed the Constitution
Founding fathers like Noah Webster who wrote the first dictionary
Could literally quote the Bible chapter and verse
These men believed you couldn't even call yourself an American
If you subvert the Word of God
To these war zones we call public schools
The only way this nation can even hope to last this decade
Is put God in America again
The only hope for America is Jesus
The only hope for our country is Him
If we repent of our ways stand firm and say
We need God in America again
So when you eliminate the Word of God from the classroom and politics
You eliminate the nation that Word protects
America is now number one in teen pregnancy and violent crime
Everyday a new holocaust of 5,000 unborn die
While pornography floods our streets like open sewers
America's dead and dying hand is on the threshold of the Church
While the spirit of Sodom and Gomorrah vex us all
When it gets to the point where people would rather
Come out of the closet than clean it
It's a sign that the judgment of God is gonna fall
And as the blood bought saints of the living God proclaim
That it's time to sound the alarm from the Church house to the White House
I believe it's time for America to stand up and proclaim
That one nation under God is our demand
And send this evil lifestyle back to Satan where it came from
And let the Word of God revive our dying land
For Jesus Christ is coming back again in all His glory
And every eye shall see Him on that day
That's why a new anointing of God's power's coming on us
To boldly tell the world you must be saved
The Bible says these things are all a farce
History tells us time and time again
To live like there's no God makes you a fool
If you want to see kids live right
Stop handing out condoms and start handing out the Word of God in schools
The only hope for America is Jesus
The only hope for our country is Him
If we repent of our ways
We need God in America again
We need God in America
Jesus Christ is Lord and God's still on the throne.
The world thinks I'm crazy.
You gotta come out from among the rest.
You gotta tell the gospel tale.
The only thing that's gonna change this world is the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Wimpy saints won't survive in spiritual warfare.
On the inside we now stand.
I believe that on the third day Jesus rose from the grave.
The world thinks we're crazy.
Our friends thinks we are crazy.
Our family thinks we're crazy.
A higher level where the devil
Our destination is Salvation
So make sure you check into the right location
And don't forget to get that first class reservation
Which be the blood of the Lamb
Jesus Christ is the captain in command
Fly the friendly skies
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
A three point landing guaranteed
Stay buckled to the word of God
Ain't gonna crash like a kamikaze
So let's keep flying to the sky and
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
Webster's dictionary say a riot is like an unrestrained
With the facts we're gonna spread God's Word
And attack every lie you've heard
Like the doctrines of men that are still fallen prey
To the silvery sword of God's Word today
And it's true we've got the gaze of eternity in our eyes
But before this church is raptured
There's no way we're gonna leave here quiet
We want a righteous invasion of truth
With a righteous invasion of truth
Invasion an armed attack
Like a church on the move that will not double back
He's the source of every plague known to the human family
We understand the mortal conflict in which we are engaged
And the gates of hell come crashing down when the saints of God begin to praise
With a righteous invasion of truth
With a righteous invasion of truth
With a righteous invasion of truth
About what the Lord has done for me
I used to be blind but now I see
The devil had me bound
They nailed His hands and feet to a cross
He healed the sick and gave to the poor
Now the Light that shines so bright
How could I do this thing
Never realizing day by day
I so need You in my life
How could I let myself
It seems like a million years
Lord I've been so away so long
Knowing I deserve to be turned away
Come now and let us reason together
Through your sin be as red as scarlet
I'll wash you whiter than snow
I'll wash you whiter than snow
And You forgave my sin
Now where else can I turn but You
No one else cares the way You do
Come now and let us reason together
Though your sin be as red as scarlet
I'll wash you whiter than snow
I'll wash you whiter than snow
Old things have been passed away and all things have become new
That You are faithful and just to forgive us of our sins
And cleanse us of all unrighteousness
It restored my heart and it healed my mind
It restored my heart and it healed my mind
When I stumbled You picked me up off the ground
You gave me hope when my faith was gone
Then You cast my sin far away
And made me clean before You
I remember when You said
Come now and let us reason together
Come now and we can talk it over
Though my sin be as red as scarlet
Then I'd imagine that this dude was after me
I promise you I saw a shadow move
I knew right then exactly what to do
Don't want no monsters in my house tonight
Don't want no monsters in my house
It's time for you to go now
I am a temple of the Holy Ghost
And I'm protected by the Lord of Hosts
Get out in the name of Jesus Christ
I watch him as he chases and he hunts
This peaceful family through the woods with only one thing on his mind
He wants to eat their little kid for lunch
An evil spirit floated by my bed
I could hardly believe the nerve of this little punk demon
Don't want no monsters in my house tonight
Don't want no monsters in my house
It's time for you to go now
I am a temple of the Holy Ghost
And I'm protected by the Lord of Hosts
Get out in the name of Jesus Christ
That we were taught that we could praise the Lord in seven ways
Seven ways to worship God and this is how it goes
It's praise that pushes through the wall of all adversity
An offering that flows to heaven in our time of need
In response to what the Lord has done through the land
An outward sign of what's inside for all the world to see
A demonstration of our love so come praise the Lord with me
In the awesome presence of the Lord and all His power
That you've been given favor by His Holy Majesty
It's praise that's given way before the answer comes about
A public testimony that drowns out all the noise
Of whiners and complainers as the saints all lift their voice
It's playing any instrument that glorifies the Lord
And praise the Lord in such a way that gets you on your toes
It's the one that is the combination of the rest
Seven ways we can say
Above the noise I hear the voice
I do believe and will receive
Within the heart of me the seed of faith
He does accept a baby step
As long as I have kept His word inside
But Jesus knows that I must grow
And tells me I must go ahead and try
It turns me out to think I'd doubt
Someone with so much clout from up above
And yet I see the way that He
Can work with me and do it all in love
And I need someone strong to help me through
I'm ready now to take the vow
And see just what the power of God can do
Now you can do something that's positive but just don't misbehave
Like use your notoriety and get somebody saved
And don't you be so vocal about the truth you know
Live the way you want but your career belongs to me
I have been bought with a price when Jesus hung on a tree
You build up all the pleasure of sin in people's eyes
But never tell the consequences of the compromise
You used to have my number but this time you will fail
There is an answer to all answers
There is a flame that burns in the night
There is an answer to all answers
There is a flame that burns in the night
Oh wave the palm branches
The crowds began to chant
They nailed Him to a cross
Then in a borrowed tomb
The Lamb of God lay dead
Just before the sun came over the eastern sky
The trees began to rattle and the birds began to fly
And the earth started to rumble and the stone was rolled away
He walked alive out of the grave
Lift your voice and sing
Flows from Calvary's mountain.
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.
There the bright and morning Star
Shed its beams around me.
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.
Help me walk from day to day
With its shadow o'er me.
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.
Till I reach the golden strand
Just beyond the river.
Till my raptured soul shall find
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone.
Sin had left a crimson stain
But He washed it white as snow
He washed it white as snow
For nothing good have I
I'll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calvary's Lamb
Sin had left a crimson stain
But He washed it white as snow
He washed it white as snow
My lips shall still repeat.
Sin had left a crimson stain
But He washed it white as snow
Sin had left a crimson stain
But He washed it white as snow
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
O precious is the flow
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
O precious is the flow
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
O precious is the flow
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
O precious is the flow
And in simple faith to plunge me
Just from Jesus simply taking
Wilt be with me to the end.
We can't contain what's inside
Thunder and lightning can't hide
Taking the Gospel where it's never been
To know Him and make Him known is our creed
Letting the fire be freed
We don't know what we will find
Deep behind enemy lines
Ready to serve Him and willing to do
He did not come into the world
He came so He could set us free
The message of salvation to live
Living for the Lord is the better way
Raising up a banner of righteousness
This generation needs to hear it now
And demonstrated with God's power
Satan lost the war and no doubt it works
And strong in the spirit
This generation needs to hear it now
And demonstrated with God's power.
Never be a heart that He
Couldn't mend each broken piece
Never be a wounded soul He would ignore
There'll never a time that He
Would ever turn his back on me
There'll never be a life He can't restore
Where do you go when you feel like
What do you do when your dreams have
Been broken and shattered
There is a Man standing with arms ope wide
Drying the tears that I've cried
Loving me and giving love
Never be a heart that He
Couldn't mend each broken piece
Never be a wounded soul He would ignore
There'll never a time that He
Would ever turn his back on me
There'll never be a life He can't restore
Never will I doubt again
I will never be without a friend
Never will me eyes fail to see
What the Lord did for me
Never be a heart that He
Couldn't mend each broken piece
Never be a wounded soul He would ignore
There'll never a time that He
Would ever turn his back on me
Never be a heart that He
Couldn't mend each broken piece
Never be a wounded soul He would Ignore
There'll never be a time that He
Would ever turn His back on me
There'll never be a life He can't restore
Where do you go when you feel like
Been broken and shattered
Drying the tears that I've cried
Loving me and giving life
Never will I doubt again
I will never be without a friend
Never will my eyes fail to see
What the Lord did for me
Jesus is the Lamb that was slain
Jesus is the Lamb that was slain
It's the easiest thing for me to stand and say
Love You from the bottom of my heart
And may I add I'd love to
Tell everyone I know just who you are
Counting every time You've heard my lonesome cry
You've committed to never ever pass me by
Thankful just to know that You are near
May I add I'd love to
Sing to every soul who wants to hear
Heaven and earth must now proclaim
Glory to God the people say
Sent from heaven and rejected
Crucified and resurrected
Holy is the Lamb that was slain
Holy is the Lamb that was slain
If tonight you stood in heaven's court to seek eternal favor...
So let's imagine for a moment you're standing dead center...
In the Courtroom of Forever...
Sitting before you is a structure massive and intense.
It's here where your fate will be determined before this Judge's bench...
And your adrenaline starts to rush.
Peering down with eyes that see through your soul...
Then off to your left across the room...
He's gonna accuse you of your sins and he knows them all... Both the old ones and the new.
So in arrogance he presents his case to the Judge and it comes out sounding something like this...
Then God opens the book where every deed is recorded and reviews your record of disgrace.
In the Courtroom of Eternity.
He turns to the first page...
God sets the book down...
If you've been forgiven...
And your name is written...
My name is in that book...
My name is in that book tonight...
I've been forgiven...
And I know my name is written...
In the Lamb's Book of Life...
Our Father which art in Heaven
On Earth as it is in Heaven
And forgive us our debts
As we forgive our debtors
Forever and ever and ever and ever
Some people wonder why we take the chances that we do
To bring the word of God into the workplace and the schools
We're looked upon as outcasts
Fanatics they may say
So why then do we still persist
To share our faith this way
We are not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
We are not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
For it is power of salvation
For those of you who fight in the wars
Against our nations sins
Heroes who give so much more than is required of them
For those of you who paid the price
Beyond what words can say
Remember that you're not alone
With the cross you bear each day
With our wounds deeper than ours
That's why no child of God
Should be embarrassed by their scars
Let's stand up and proclaim...
That it's the Gospel that saved me
And the Gospel raised me
Daniel was in trouble in the lion's den
But he knew what prayer was all about
Daniel trusted God and he got out again
Moses told the pharaoh back in Egypt land
They headed for the promised land
Peter saw the Master walking on the sea
You said that I would stumble
You said I wouldn't last
You said that I would crumble
From all that's in my past
You tried to break me
Tried to take me with your lies
Tried to chop me down to size
Tried to rush me and attack
But Jesus Christ is in my life
Slam temptation with the Word
I can slam each lie that I have heard
I can slam the devil on his back
The word of God will stop the attack
In my mind there is no fear
In my mind there is no doubt
Yes I am that Christian that hell warned you about
You told me it was useless
That I would never change
You told me it was hopeless
That I never would get saved
Tried to plug me up with guilt
Tried to boot my mind on tilt
Tried to bill me for my sin
But the blood has washed me clean
If I don't glorify Your name
Help me remember this truth I've learned
That Kingdoms come and Kingdoms go
But though the Word of God I know
When all in life is done and past
Only what's done for Christ will last
To sacrifice and reach a star
But then lose sight of who You are
To gain the world and lose the soul
My spirit can understand
Lord I lift Your name on high
Lord I love to sing Your praises
I'm so glad You're in my life
I'm so glad You came to save us
You came from Heaven to Earth
From the Earth to the Cross
From the Cross to the Grave
From the Grave to the Sky
We humble ourselves now as we pray
Renouncing every sin and wicked way
I feel Jesus I feel Jesus
I feel Jesus In this place
Yes my soul does Burn within me
I feel Jesus In this place
There's a peaceful breeze of heaven in the air
There's a gentle flow of music everywhere
Something whispers all is well
And assures me child fear not
There's a swell of love overtaking me
And I know it's the presence of God
I feel Jesus in the place
Yes my soul does Burn within me
Here is the jam going cross the land
And a jam that I think you know
It's a groove on the move and a groove you've heard from the Word called the 1-5-0
It's all about praise when the big band plays
And it makes the saints go wild
Bring the glory down with the trumpet sound
With the harp and the lyre everyone can hear
And the people clap their hands
The spirit's right and with all their might
Everyone starts to dance
Our Father which art in Heaven
On Earth as it is in Heaven
And forgive us our debts
As we forgive our debtors
Forever and ever and ever and ever
Today let's just look back over our lives
Everything that the Lord has done
Give thanks to the Holy One
Give thanks because He's
Given Jesus Christ His Son
And now let the weak say I am strong
Let the poor say I am rich
Because of what the Lord has done for us
I love you Lord and I wanna give thanks
Give thanks to the Holy One
Give thanks because He's
Given Jesus Christ His Son
And now let the weak say I am strong
Let the poor say I am rich
Because of what the Lord has done for us
Can you lift up your heart...
Tell Him that you love Him
By the blood of the Lamb
All my sins are washed away
You can talk about me
All my sins are washed away
I've been to the river
And I've been baptized
All my sins are washed away
All my sins are washed away
I love Jesus yes I do
I love Jesus how about you
The bottom line the way to win
Is up with Jesus down with sin
Only Christ can set you free
Christ can set you free
I love Jesus yes I do
Thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
Thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
Thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
Thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
Lord we praise You Lord we praise You
Lord we praise You Lord we praise You
Lord we praise You Lord we praise You
Lord we praise You Lord we praise You
Lord I love You Lord I love You
Lord I love You Lord I love You
Lord I love You Lord I love You
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth
Because after that time the earth was without form
And void and darkness was over the face of the deep
But a phenomenon was about to take place
Because the Spirit of God was hovering over those waters
That's why after all this time I can stand here and say
When He rolls up His sleeves
Our God is and awesome God
There is thunder in His footsteps And lightning in His fists
Our God is an awesome God
The Lord wasn't joking
It wasn't for no reason
That he shed His blood
His return is very close
And so you better be believing that
Our God is an awesome God
Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from Heaven above
With wisdom power and love
Our God is an awesome God
And when the sky was starless
In the void of the night
Our God is an awesome God
He spoke into the darkness
And created the light
Our God is an awesome God
He poured out on Sodom
Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross
I hope that we have not
Too quickly forgotten that
Bless the name of Jesus
Praise the name of Jesus
Sing unto the King of Israel
Glory to His name forever
It's all over the floor
It's all up in the walls
That we are in the House of Praise
We've got more praise to give
Stand up make a joyful noise
Stand up make a joyful noise
Stand up give Him praise
Stand Up and give Him praise.
I gotta let this praise come out.
I've been alone and I've been forgotten
I know what it feels like to be on the bottom.
Nothing to look forward to and nobody there.
I've felt the grip of the spirit that takes you
Under the ways of depression that makes you
Numb to the feeling of hope and you just don't care.
More and more each day.
Feel I've lost my way.
Will find You through the maze
Of all of my confusion when I pray.
That You're there for me
That You're with me still.
And I need to hear You say
That You love me and You always will.
I know it's not a one way street
You need to hear from me.
That I'm there for You
That I'm with You still
And You need to hear me say
But now I'm on a whole new avenue.
Bow I see new hope for me
Going where I've never been
We serve a good God here today.
Let me tell you a little bit about Him.
There is somewhere I know I can go.
He healed my body and He healed my mind.
He healed my body and he healed my mind.
You didn't wait for any of us to get our act cleaned up.
For You were the cleaning up of our act.
I am what it says I am
I have what it says I have
I'll do what it says I'll do
It has given me new life
It is the Word of God
When I'm lost and gone astray
It helps me find my way
When I quote it I well see
The devil has to flee
I am what it says I am
I have what it says I have
I'll do what it says I'll do
It has given me new life
All my friends been wondering
Since I took my stand for Christ
You see they're wondering just what's in store
That's when the Lord stirs up my soul
And I quite clearly say...
Testifying child of the King
And then I'll dream about witnessing.
I'm gonna walk and talk and act like Jesus
Though I may get feathered and tarred
The expressions on their faces change
You know the looks they give are priceless
Well I'm proud to be living for Jesus
It's all over the floor
It's all up in the walls
That we are in the House of Praise
We've got more praise to give
Stand up make a joyful noise
Stand up make a joyful noise
Stand up give Him praise
Stand Up and give Him praise.
I gotta let this praise come out.

Strength will rise as we wait upon
We will wait upon the Lord
We will wait upon the Lord
Strength will rise as we wait upon
We will wait upon the Lord
We will wait upon the Lord
You are the everlasting God
You're the defender of the weak
You comfort those in need
You lift us up on wings like eagles
Strength will rise as we wait upon
We will wait upon the Lord
We will wait upon the Lord
Strength will rise as we wait upon
We will wait upon the Lord
King of righteousness
He's enshrined as sovereign king every way
He's the king of the heaven the ages and more
He's the king of all kings
And he is the lord of lords
He's entirely sincere
He's eternally steadfast
He's immortally graceful
With the impartial mercy he's shown
He's been misinterpreted and misrepresented
As the greatest phenomenon this world has ever known
His limitless love for all mankind
Still the one true only way
He's the loftiest idea
In all literature read
In the philosophers head
The real of the master of the universe
I wanna let everybody know
He's strength for the weak
For the tempted and tried
He sustains and leads
He defends the feeble
To the down and wounded
He rewards the diligent
Turns losers to winners
Discharges the debtors
He forgives all the sinners
After 2000 years he still saves and
Delivers and he heals.
He's limitless in goodness
His grace is sufficient
He's the key to all knowledge
And the pathway to every good thing
He's the highway to righteousness
Compassion to indifference
He's the wellspring of wisdom
He's the doorway to deliverance
You can't live without him
And you can't out live him
Everybody knows that's my king
I want everybody know that's my king
I wish I could describe him
But he's indescribable
He's so incomprehensible
He's the most irresistible intoxicant
You will ever hear about
He'll make you wanna sing
He'll make you clap your hands
He'll make you wanna testify
And preach to every man
He'll make you wanna stand up
Their questions no problem
The pharisees couldn't stand him
They all couldn't stop him
Soldiers couldn't scare him
Nobody could make him leave town
Pilate couldn't find any fault in him
Angry mob couldn't chill him
The cross didn't slow him
Death couldn't handle him
And the grave couldn't hold him down
Everybody know that's my king
He's the king of righteousness
He's king of the heavens
He's king of all kings
He's the loftiest idea
In all literature read
He's immortally graceful
He's entirely sincere
He defends the feeble
To the down and wounded he's a shield
He discharges the debtors
He still saves delivers and heals
His grace is sufficient
He's the wellspring of wisdom
He's the doorway to deliverance
As his flesh just hung like rivets
As his face they punched and smacked
All the splinters from the criss crossed beam dug deep into his back
When he did some blood splattered
The prophet looked and said
And as they dropped the cross in the hole they dug
His body convulsed with pain
Through the agony and torment
That never a soul shall find
He tilts his face towards heaven
With full control of his mind
With more love then any human heard
Before that time or since
He made a statement that to this day
And as he gave his life for those lost in sin
The Atoning cleansing blood of the Lamb
Keeping watch over their flock by night
And the glory of the Lord shone around them
And they were greatly afraid
For unto You is born this day
For unto You is born this day
And this shall be a sign to know
A baby wrapped in swaddling clothes
Lying in the manger lo
For unto You is born this day
For unto You is born this day
And this shall be a sign to know
A baby wrapped in swaddling clothes
He will be lying in a manger lo
For unto a child is born
Unto us a Son is given
And the government will be upon His shoulder
And His name will be called
Of the increase of his government and peace
Upon the throne of David and over his kingdom
To order it and establish it
With judgment and justice
From that time forward and even forevermore
And the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this
And this shall be a sign to know
A baby wrapped in swaddling clothes
He will be lying in a manger lo
And this shall be a sign to know
A baby wrapped in swaddling clothes
He will be lying in a manger lo
For unto You is born this day
Unto You is born this day
Moses knew it way back in Egypt land
My God will take care of me
My God will take care of me
And walk me through the valley of shadow and death again
My God will take care of me
Written by the finger of God back then
Written on stone and the hearts of man
My God will take care of me
My God will take care of me
And walk me through the valley of shadow and death again
My God will take care of me
And walk me through that valley of shadow and death again
My God will take care of me
And walk me through that valley of shadow and death again
Names synonymous with the spirit of our country
They wrote the Declaration of Independence
With liberty and justice for all
But something happened since Jefferson called the Bible
The cornerstone for American liberty
Then put it in our schools as a light or since
Our country was founded on the Gospel of Jesus Christ
We eliminated God from the equation of American life
Thus eliminating the reason this nation first began
From beyond the grave I hear the voices of our founding fathers plead
You need God in America again
Of the 55 men who formed the Constitution
Fifty two were active members of their Church
Founding fathers like Noah Webster who wrote the first dictionary
Could literally quote the Bible chapter and verse
These men believed you couldn't even call yourself an American
If you subvert the Word of God
To these war zones we call public schools
The only way this nation can even hope to last this decade
Is to put God in America again
The only hope for America is Jesus
The only hope for our country is Him
So when you eliminate the Word of God from the classroom
America is now number one in teen pregnancy and violent crime
Every day a new holocaust of 5,000 unborn die
While pornography flood our streets like open sewers
America's dead and dying hand is on the threshold of the Church
While the spirit of Sodomy and Gomorrah vex us all
When it gets to the point where people would rather
Come out of the closet than clean it
It's the sign that the judgment of God is gonna fall
And as the blood bought saints of the living God proclaim
That it's time to send the alarm from the Church house
I believe it's time America to stand up and proclaim
That one nation under God is our demand
And send this evil lifestyle back to Satan where it came from
And let the Word of God revive our dying land
For Jesus Christ is coming back again in all His glory
And every eye shall see Him on that day
That's why a new anointing of God's power's coming on us
To boldly tell the world you must be saved
The Bible says these things are all farce
History tells us time and time again
To live like there's no God makes you a fool
And start handing out the Word of God in schools
The only hope for America is Jesus
The only hope for our country is Him
I know the only hope for America is Jesus
We need God in America
There is a spiritual fight
We cannot see with our eyes
Between the angels of light
And the demons from the dark side
This power if you believe
But you got to fight on your knees
In the midst of any circumstance
As long as you are on God side
The power of hell cannot defeat the light
It's war to win your every trial
Now Jericho was tightly shut up
Because of the children of Israel
None went out and none came in
And the Lord said unto Joshua
And the king there of and the mighty men of valor
Thus shalt thou do six days
And seven priests shall bear before
The ark seven trumpets of rams horns
And the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times
And the priests shall blow the trumpets
And it shall come to pass
That when they make a long blast with the ram's horn
And when ye hear the sound of the trumpet
All the people shall shout with a great shout
And the wall of the city shall fall down flat
And the people shall ascend up every man straight before him
For the Lord hath said unto Joshua
The inhabitants of Jericho were perverted by sin and corrupt
Stood waiting for commands of war to come
Trained under Moses righteous hand
And it was Joshua who led nearly
Three million Israelites into the promised land
Now Moses was dead and the real test came could
He simply follow God's word and do something
That to the natural mind would be utterly absurd
Without Moses to ask advice of or an advisory committee
Setting at our disposal weaponry that drops demons to the floor
Something with tremendous power that assassinates fear and doubt
It lifts us above the circumstance and lets God's power flow
The shout of victory binds the Devil with chains that won't let go
So with the confidence of warring angels
Israel stood stone ready to obey Joshua
Speak to their mountain and shout
For God was giving them the city
And the last day they marched seven
While the Canaanites jeered from their evil wall
Israel's faith reached heaven before any manifestation
They looked fear dead in its face
They didn't wait to feel some Earthquake or to see a lightening flash
They didn't need to hear a theatric rumble or a mind blowing crash
They prepared their souls for victory
Now its God's turn to come through
They'd scream their lungs out simply
Because they believed God's word was true
So with the high praises of God in their mouths
And Israel shouted in victory and they shouted in faith
And the walls came tumbling down
Now this is where we come in
Now how many know the anointing breaks the yolks
When the anointed move in spontaneous praise of man
When we worship and when we pray
Are you ready to tear down walls
You sick and tired of being down and out
You ready to ransack the kingdom of darkness
You ready to let some strong holds fall
Then in the name of Jesus Christ I challenge you tonight
And trials you've been in.
To leap up on your feet right now
Make a joyful noise and praise the Lord
Put on the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness
Lift up your voice and sing
Wanna look good I'll tell you how
First gotta paint on you're eyebrows
Spray you're hair with Aqua Net
Get a tattoo to rep your set
Need a gallon of mascara
Thick eye liner in my eye
Got four kids with three guys
Thick eye liner in my eye
Got four kids with three guys
Speak Spanish when they speak
My man's been locked up forevers
When he gets out he'll be mad
That his boy's my baby's dad
Got a blade in my hair when I fight
Thick eye liner in my eye
Got four kids with three guys
Thick eye liner in my eye
Got four kids with three guys
Praise Him in the noon time
Love Him in the noon time
Serve Him in the noon time
Tell me what is this thing that I feel like I'm missing
And why can't I let it go
There's gotta be more to life...
Than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me
Cause the more that I'm...
I've got the time and I'm wasting it slowly
I'm always waiting on something other than this
When the bank was on I cocked a gun from a dope fiend
The beef is back on but I don't really know the reason
So how you wanna handle your biz ya bitch made mark
Leave ya dead to the head in Ocean View Park
Wit artillery in their hand ready start to buck
The Bay Area ain't no joke
The Bay Area ain't no joke
Boom boom boom was the sound that I heard
Ran to the turf to see what happened
In they nuts or they draws pocket a crack sack
So you better listen what I gotta say
And that right there tells you that life's a bitch
Don't focus on the finger miss all that heavenly glory
Take a look around the room and it feels like I finally made it
To the stage where we don't play games now come alive
If I ever want my record to see the light of day
We the creed of a better breed and you never read and
Behold the horse I'm paler to ever be
I rock steadily in the spot ready or not
He ready for Armageddon now wet him in acid
Want me to speed it up motherfucker it ain't Tech
I spray seven or eight I'm alive to aim steady
Might behead ya psyches dead for life he bled
Bright ran away for the night I'm a sinner
Chose to be cold and overload ya with vulgar
Gotta leave a crater in this game before the clock's done
The combination so uncommon a cause of company
I'm headed for oblivion and can't nobody save me
This roll is for a chick and this carnage is for the record book
Paint a picture of pain and pleasure inside a symphony
Somebody told me real see through anybody to hear tech.
I'm ready for all the hatred they about to spit to a stranger.
When I wrote this back in November I was grinding to get my own dinner
Focusing on my earth fire and air to keep my soul centered.
My aura glow when I got that gum and I want that dope next
Lining up on my track so I let my body rejuvenate.
Allow me to elucidate energy flow illuminate
What I need is room and a couple of boxes of matches
Hands for all the people see this one is not a practice.
Walk all around them but I leave them like I found them
Now I'm in the position to turn up the gas and come out the kitchen.
When I crack a can of oxygen hoping to get it popping
The stairs are full of smoke and that elevator's no exit.
I'm back to stay I've been active since back in the day but even then
Plus nothing got these eager fast and never get back to see the kid.
Inner is the primary reason y'all know it exist
I may day before I plus my price ingredient
Even if they wanna know what does it take in
How do I make my pride in many this
And why do the people keep on disappearing
All of that money for me and for mine
We're in tour and we're getting this money
Couldn't stop at a pocket of creamed dough.
Lots of fathers are getting their dreams crushed
I live to seek another thing in a minute and it really gets it for a cream huff.
Take off your blind fold
Not a corridor or screen.
Trapped inside a dream
You can tell me what you want
You can tell me what you need
But love is in the smoke
And we can't even breathe.
And I can not see you
And you can not see me.
But love is in the smoke
And we can't even breathe.
And me shattered into pieces is what you leave
I know when it will happen
Now my passion is for pain and I breathe hot smoke.
Maybe we were meant to be
Now I look for you again
But I still can't see
Baby we can't breathe.
I smell the smoke in the room
She told me that the roof was on fire
We don't need any water.
We can teeter and totter
But you don't need to be coddled
I'm headed down this road alone
I don't want you to follow
Bitches think it's all about the pussy and a spray tan
It's hot as hell out here
She feels like she got burns
Maybe she needs closure.
It feels like the pilot light is out in this bitch
Come up with some work now we're gonna get some cash.
But enemies him gotta exterminate.
Gonna figure out if you get served you make
The same amount of cake that he get for eight week straight.
Now we got a got and I hope that you know
Now we got a got and I hope that you know
Now we got a got and I hope that you know
So when you think the thing gonna crack you know
Who the director when you gonna act your role.
The wrong motherfucker just got killed today
Get over and get it with a black pill
You faced a cold hundred watch it when I spell the name.
King dead before the damn thing hits the ground.
He don't like trouble but he brings it around.
All up on your quit when he spits around
Wet like sweat but not from the buzz
He said cool when the word get to my crew
The same amount that I did working late for 8 weeks straight
Now I got a got and I hope that you know
So when you think the thing gonna crack you know
Who the director when you gonna act your role.
The wrong motherfucker just got killed today
Get over and get it with a black pill
You faced a cold hundred watch it when I spell the name.
King dead before the damn thing hits the ground.
I don't like trouble but he brings it around.
All up on your quit when the thing spits around
Wet like sweat but not from the buzz
I said cool when the word get to my crew
I don't know how I'm alive
Chalk it up as dumb luck
Now I'm bout to cop a ball
And grab another bottle.
He said just keep this shit in check
Please don't let it drown a gift
Call that shit that other crack.
Yeah I love this liquor
Holler at the bartender
Tell her make this one a double
He said he gotta baby in the trunk.
Feels like all I really need
I am rotten on the inside
No one should be this high
Double helix makes knots
Like everybody a shots
If you ain't swill then get gone
Well keep your lady safe.
Feel my vibe radiate.
They try to eat us up
They like the way we taste
They wanna trade me places
But they afraid of fate.
They don't know a layaway
Struggle on a day to day
Juggle when I play with weight
As if you ain't afraid of me
While I sip upon an A to B.
Eons beyond their capability
I question their credibility.
Permanent slumber come from my soliloquy.
Knowing what's around the corner
Well keep your lady safe
I see their shady face
Feel my vibe radiate.
They try to greet us but don't recognize the face
They slip and crumble
They try to play me close
But can't invade in the space
I see their shady face
Feel my vibe radiate.
They couldn't say she ate the hunger in my appetite
To ask me why I'm angry and not bat a eye is asinine
They couldn't classify my purpose for perniciousness
Bout to write the type of shit that makes you want to pack a pipe.
Well keep your lady safe
Feel my vibe radiate.
I see their shady face
I'm trying to find a way with myself and he violate it.
And illusion it's all that the life is and there's nothing to it.
I'll prove it with cubics and cone and now we've grown into a diamond
If I can show it to you know that you will never leave it.
Whatever they believe it's true.
No matter what they see they will know what came to be
Whatever they believe it's true
You'd think that with all the attention that a nigger be happy.
The villain is killing or even ill I'm still on the grind.
Gotta know the half of what was doing in was dang.
And the rest of y'all who wanna came real in the campaign
Hotter than R chain is hard if I ain't swilling them
Believe in what you will while I keep this all connected.
Put me into a peer and quit to find a ladder out.
No matter what they say they don't know what to say to me.
No matter what they see they don't know what came to be.
Pissing these people off while I master my high
I'm walking on the ledge and they don't even notice.
And I made it in for the rave yo
One love to the faithful
Those who take the advantage of good people can stay broke
I served up breakfast's yest that make it look greasy
They don't like the way that put things
One love to the old clique
I trained it all in for mice to twice the emotion
Struggle for energy is constant
Inviting any and everybody got enemy that wants it
The John Lennon to me forever will be conscious
It's gonna be whatever they eat
Now don't come beat two of my precious
Be know what they do me no favors
When I'm come from the jungles scared
All up in they mouth of a hater like a retainer
Heat up in the moment come second to the pain
Picture you for seek so often in my head.
Feel my heartbeat beat pumping in my chest
Everything we're speaking on secret on the phone
We can be together if it wasn't up to me.
Thinking we can never ever fire up a flame.
Smoking in the green room thinking with the blues
Hoping you don't stray because you're feeling so alone.
Keeping covered walls while speaking with a smile
Flipping out on niggers who she don't know how to act.
But they came to be a curse or maybe we should quit.
You apologize and I'm sure it's overdue.
Caught up in the game and affecting the brain and I feel like I gonna have nuts now.
Can't see more with the crew assess and we built this thing from the ground up.
Since matter no money you could pay me
Now I change ways try to be the same in these fast times and these strange days.
Came in the game with a ball in his hand and if they change I'm still working
And in the moment like opponent they can feel me like I was wrapping the ether.
Guess I bet you gotta hit the deck and need dirt with all of these darts flying.
Posted up in that gold mine and my whole mind is on cloud nine.
The snake on the back are back at the back of the building
Give me mine and they gonna tender
Fuck me on the dough and we are all black with millions
Fuck me on the dough and we are all black with millions
Guess I got it deep but first I got to buy that shovel.
And then we got to make that bubble.
You gotta pay the profit to witness to how he rock it.
Hard and you got to chop it to profit.
Fuck me on the dough and we are all black with millions
Fuck me on the dough and we are all black with millions
That's why every time I call he duck me on the phone
Knew the game was shady when I started out
Don't forget about your kid while you're carving out your needs
The part about that is the industry's offended
When I made your labels dusted by a fucking independent.
I bet you don't know nothing about no hundred dollar payments
Fuck me on the dough and we are all black with millions
Fuck me on the dough and we are all black with millions
In the company of more wealthy people I never met.
Red headed bitches for mommy and daddy work ups.
Committing suicide if they put a price on my head.
I was on early gas come to put me out in the cold
Fuck me on the dough and we are all black with millions
Fuck me on the dough and we are all black with millions
Nobody gave a qualm or fuck about the weather.
Got a bunch of stupid shit that I would've been good without.
Could've took the high road but I felt like I had to have it.
As if it doesn't accumulate every fiscal year.
When it comes down to it we are ass.
Nothing is infinite tips scales.
The people every day sharing a similar state of mind.
Antarctica's demise provides the higher tide.
Climate change became societal cyanide.
Earthquake in cities collapse under rubble and ash.
Calamity crept in while humanity slept.
The hurricane sandy effect to get your sanity test.
The television projects more panic and stress.
Waiting patiently for something to go wrong.
Procrastination is slowly paving the way for to this era of consequence.
So I reminisce and all my thoughts just keep on playing.
So fall away with me.
Who shower us with your loving and make it all possible
I'm trying to put into words but I can't explain
Where my time is so short and I can't afford to go fuck
Searching for the rest of me got me up in Sesame.
They can't decide whether we are civilized or enemies.
Caught your eyes and I find you on my mind constantly.
I'm lost and feeling crazy till the day you fall away with me.
So I reminisce and all my thoughts just keep on playing.
So fall away with me.
In pinning this I couldn't tell you where the word's from.
The fellas hopping and picking the bitches just wanna touch us.
Gotta leave a crater in this game before the clock's done
The combination so uncommon a cause of company
I'm headed for oblivion and can't nobody save me
This roll is for a chick and this carnage is for the record book
Paint a picture of pain and pleasure inside a symphony
If I ever want my record to see the light of day
We the creed of a better breed and you never read and
Behold the horse I'm paler to ever be
I rock steadily in the spot ready or not
He ready for Armageddon now wet him in acid
Want me to speed it up motherfucker it ain't Tech
I spray seven or eight I'm alive to aim steady
Might behead ya psyches dead for life he bled
Bright ran away for the night I'm a sinner
Chose to be cold and overload ya with vulgar
I'm on a pilgrimage to the rhyme mecca
And this mind left ya
And if swines ever find the quest to try and test the cleverness
Big wars and not a critic whore
Will begin about you from hungry pumas
It's unfair to be such a motherfucking rarity
Beware that we terminate squares if he dares to be a parody
Of this clarity we dare to be sheriffs swear we need therapy
Down try the make things right
You feel the way I do
Love has changed its course
Crashed upon the shore
I can see it in your eyes
You feel the way I do
Love has changed its course
Crashed upon the shore
I can see it in your eyes
You feel the way I do
Love has changed its course
Crashed upon the shore
I can see it in your eyes
I got no patience and I got no fear
I got no patience and I got no fear
I got no patience and don't shed a tear
I got no patience and I got no fear
I got no patience and don't shed a tear
I got no patience and I got no fear
You know that you are gold
Don't think about what I have told
You know that you are gold
Don't think about what I have told
You know that you are gold
Don't think about what I have told
You know that you are gold
Don't think about what I have told
You know that you are gold
Don't think about what I have told
You know that you are gold
You listen while I talk to you now
I tell you what we're gonna do now
Move your body all around and just shake
Oh that's the way you do it now
Ha you shake it like a bowl of soup yeah
You let it go loop the loop yeah
You put your hands on your hip now
Come on and let your backbone slip
Move your body like a whip and just shake
But if you're ready to roll
You got to do the thing with soul
Move your body like a whip
If you want to really roll now
Got to do the thing with soul
Just let your body loop the light
Early in the morning you're doing the shake
I got it if you want some drank
Your body is my playground
Make you feel the way you say you wanna feel
Are you the type that wants a man to take charge
Hit it until you breathless bust and still stay hard
Are you the type that want a man to pull your hair make you scream folks in the other room you don't even care
Its early in the night
Using all of my might
Pull out the cups to add spice
The beat is D minor but I'm oh so major
I do my own thing so I owe no favors
Can't do it now then I won't go later
Haters wanna see the boy get lost in the sauce
But it's gravy so boy get lost
Hated or not I am great and about to get greater
I keep it real and my ladies do the same
High class chicks that be crazy in the brain
Style so mean swag is vicious
I ain't got no problems with girls out in Harlem but
See I had a dope fling with a girl out in queens but
The Bronx is live that's where my mom resides but
My girl Angie can't be a groupie or whore
She bout getting money in her juicy couture
Do she get bored with the Gucci of course
So the Louis she sports till it ain't new anymore
Ain't seen her in a minute know her ass got fatter
And if you think she bad than her friends are way badder
In church every weekend she need to be a deacon
Maybe she would chill if I would beat it off
Cause no one ever slows her agenda
I ain't got no problems with girls out in Harlem but
See I had a dope fling with a girl out in queens but
The Bronx is live that's where my mom resides but
BK girls down with that ride or die
So I always keep one right by my side
See I love New York I ain't gotta lie
I gotta friend named Shayna
She like Bill Bellamy and how to be a player
Shorty is a player can't nobody play her
Player she do it so easy it's kinda like a layup
She could lay up with your boy with no make up
Even on the road I'm a keep 2 or 3
Bad BK chicks that speak fluently
In the Hamilton language girl speak to me please
Now I can't get rid of any girl for shit
So when they look at me I don't look away
Now let the hook play
I ain't got no problems with girls out in Harlem but
See I had a dope fling with a girl out in queens but
The Bronx is live that's where my mom resides but
So they forever make me get better instead of lose
They can wager it on a battle better believe I'll take it
Great with the hustle till I'm late to a puddle
Do you understand what I mean
I'll beat you with a branch from your family tree
You see the way we get down son you don't want it
They say I talk a little bit fast
Lyrically you are a nuisance but you can't tell
I wanna beat they ass till my two hands swell
My team tight no way my crew can't gel
Me and my team proceed but lean back
No need to repeat the scene I've seen that
They say I talk a little bit fast
You might need to put your rhymes on the trash can diet
Destroy yourself if you've heard it invincible is the verdict
Pop the tool just to remove his medulla
Your resembling feces when compared to the demon fetus
They say I talk a little bit fast
They got a lot of opinions they won't say to my face
I'm pink so why would I stay in a race
And graffiti with the semen when I spray in her face
If my world once should be tarnished
And all my words were garbage
Would you ever take a promise from me
If the world was just a fable
Our lives were on a table
Do you think that you'd be able to see
I live life to the fullest
Fuck a knife or a bullet
My soul is a grenade pin
I'm likely to pull it
Grown up they always told me play nicely
Never good in groups I was born to be a leader
You hear me loud and clear like I was born to be a speaker
The industry's a slut
Get up on and you could see her
I walk through war zones I wore right through my sneakers
The demon seed from heaven
You don't want war with me
Everybody's a race Black and White
Well my race is pink so
See this world is mine I beat the devil in pinball
No bat mask and my message is get lost
Play it back and you get the same shit
If my world once should be tarnished
And all my words were garbage
Would you ever take a promise from me
If the world was just a fable
Our lives were on a table
Do you think that you'd be able to see
The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled
Is the exact same trick that the treble ever pulled
The best way you could ever face a fool
Give him a little bass the think it's dope
Next thing you know they gonna drink the potion
But this is Pink Magic no need to inject it
Just put it in your ears you need to respect it
See my my only fear is being rejected
Only real fear is fear you know me being reckless
Don't believe me you'll believe in a second
Speak through the wind so the breeze is my Lexus
It's more than just a lie
Believe and accept it
I'm a genetic curse perfectly and perfected
I fuck an angel that can turn into a beast when he's tested
Eat through the flesh and proceed to the next king
My kingdom has come your dynasty has to exit
The genius the best kid
Ring the alarm the color pink is a charm
And I'll be damned if I ain't got the world singing my song
If my world once should be tarnished
And all my words were garbage
Would you ever take a promise from me
If the world was just a fable
Our lives were on a table
Do you think that you'd be able to see
I tell them cut it out like Uncle Joey and shit
I don't owe you for shit
That's why I keep to myself
Stay out in Brooklyn for a day
I'm God's soldier boy
God is a Woman when she on her period
That get it sensitive she get mad
And take it out on my penmanship
But she late on my birthday
She pregnant immaculate conception
Dig this shit if it is what it is I live this shit
Show me who you are and I will do the same.
So just let me invent from the top of the head.
Unless it was sent from the devil in a message
Nothing is promise life is basketball
But with that love comes struggle and stress
I take her by the hand
Then we had a threesome
And no one knew the difference
You can have anything that it brings
You can have my absence of faith
You can have my everything
I pick apart my insides
I got no soul to sell
The only thing that works for me
Help me get away from myself
Sick of getting played like a xylophone
My instrument is me with thousands of bones
I need a chick to be kinda dope
This relationship is so dangerous
So I say that every kiss like a sanction
I need cash just to give you a ring
There's nothing right
It's too much my babe I need you
It's too much my babe I need you
Red wine and cheese before bed time
You and I fell in love is the headline
I stay silent and let you chime in
But I hate fights and now I got stage fright
Until I'm at your place at the late night
I love it when you catch an attitude
I want to tease you just to laugh at you
There's nothing right
It's too much my babe I need you
It's too much my babe I need you
I'm looking great but I still feel shame
For real it's the game
No one else can so I'm your man
Your palm reads bliss
You are what I miss and we all need this
Love and affection is all we miss
From the world but with each other
As long as I can call us together
There's nothing right
In New York raining there's too much
I know I'm intoxicated but I don't care
She's trying to figure out why I keep glancing
If your too high and you can't listen
Tune in to the new transmission
Step out of life and make the transition
She screams without a sound she's so profound
Plus I kept envisioning the woman I was taking home
Always get in trouble I don't follow no rules
I got a easy pass so I gotta go through
The funny thing is that a lot of those dudes
Use to be a prick now I don't know you
I'm so cute that I'm hideous man
I'm the truth it's ridiculous man
They all fell in love with the satellite song
The reason her and Dorian would act so mean
I guess that's the reason I rap so free
Never spit the same bar twice... twice
Never hit the same broad twice... twice
Never hit the same broad twice if you hit the same broad hit the same broad twice you that night
If you don't like the new me I'll bring the old me in
And I do it for the kids... nickelodeon
See girls don't really wanna mess with me
Then den seen they friend fall now they wanna do it too
Just know I'm just waking up so...
Who wanna sit behind keys and start problems
I am not Charles Hamilton dot com
I Shut The Game Down Again
I was raised in the concrete safari
You other clowns got hate in your blood
I don't need some new fans endorsement
I'm endorsed by these mad important
Cats with more than enough to buy your life
No strings attached when I sling my raps
Seen in your favorite magazine with a great pose
You ain't catch when I said I put my mack down Like I got a girl's top on my lap now
That was mad hot and mad foul
Mac lip gloss... Mac laptop
How arrogant of me to explain a hot bar from a track I did for free
All the night she keep call me back to the club to see if DJ another bar.
He call me over knowing that I'm taken so I went over thinking he's just a friend one thing led to the other.
My boy friend went to think we were together.
Look to me right tell my man to go home be back as soon as I take my girls home.
Pull one sting and she winds in faster her boyfriend is here that spells disaster.
Just dropping of my new CD sweetie.

Groovy groovy yes yes we

Click my heels and I blink two times
You getting only three or four more seconds of mine
Than wait this one out cause you didn't hurry up

If its really the rhythm let me see
All I feel is warm sensations
And your conversation

You got a little bit off both of them but listen
You didn't like hurry I told you so you gets none
Is there any boys around here who can spitfire
All I feel is warm sensations
And your conversation
Just can't get me babe
Used to talk on the phone to the early in the morning
Under all circumstances you were around
Didn't think it was a major risk
And now it's changed all up into this
And I really miss what we had
And I wanna get us back
You never took it personal before I was your girl
Let's get right back where we belong
I used to tell you everything now I can't say anything
Let's get right back where we belong
And all of the nights you gave me advice
They've all been replaced by the usual fights
And now I don't know what to do to get us back
Right back where we belong
Let's get right back where we belong
Let's get right back where we belong
Smothering me on the time
When I move to the left you're still hanging on my right
And you never had it in you to but how you acted
Now it's like I'm not so sure
And I really miss what we had
So can we go back to when
You never took it personal before I was your girl
Let's get right back where we belong
I used to tell you everything now I can't say anything
Let's get right back where we belong
And all of the nights you gave me advice
They've all been replaced by the usual fights
And now I don't know what to do to get us back
Right back to where we belong
Let's get right back where we belong
Let's get right back where we belong
You were my rock you were my mate
Right up in my face when I was losing faith
You wouldn't get mad when I would say no
You let me be free but now you wanna control
I was for you and you was for me
I'm at the point the point of no returning
Let's get right back where we belong
You never took it personal before I was your girl
Let's get right back where we belong
I used to tell you everything now I can't say anything
Let's get right back where we belong
And all of the nights you gave me advice
They've all been replaced by the usual fights
And now I don't know what to do to get us back
Right back to where we belong
Let's get right back where we belong
Let's get right back where we belong
Let's get right back where we belong
Let's get right back where we belong
You never took it personal
Until I was your girl
I used to tell you everything
Introduced me to to an old high school friend
All of a sudden she was at home with us
She would have to make it through
She ain't your friend
So that I can ask her on my own
Everywhere she ask to go
She would have to make it through
She ain't your friend
Till I saw her try to put a move onto you baby
I'll tell you she a man taker
I told you that she is
I told you what she was
I'll tell you what she is
She ain't your friend
The first time you walked pass my way
But now said you cannot the replace
This is the day will left then had to go
Pray that I would somehow see you once both
And I swear that I will find my way to you
That If we really worth mend to be
Some really has together
And that is it for me forever
How on the watches grow up
And I swear that I will find my way to you
I didn't gave any chance
To give myself to you
For you came and why you gone
And I swear that I will find my way to you
I swear that I would make my way to see ya
And I won't stop until I find ya
This ain't nothing but a summer jam
This ain't nothing but a summer jam
In the heat of the night
Until the morning light
I'm waiting for the day
This ain't nothing but a summer jam
This ain't nothing but a summer jam
I'm waiting for the day
This ain't nothing but a summer jam
This ain't nothing but a summer jam
I ain't go judge ya if you ain't an academic
Even if you hurt my feelings boy I supply you
Baby you don't mean it
You may not determine
What your future holds
As long as we're together
That's all I wanna know
I want you to be my everything
I don't want no secrets between us
As long as we're together
That's all I want in life
I ain't in that category
I appreciate you for who you are
To satisfy my every need
I can't say no more except my love is for real
Five years down the line
Only wanna think about the
I can't see myself with nobody else
You can even be a thousand miles away
All I know is that I need you baby
Loving you is like second nature
Without you I ain't breathing
Feels like I'm suffocating
Ask me to be yours and you as mine
I'm over all that playing
Baby I provide affection
I can see myself growing old with you
You complete my world
All I know is that I want you honey
And Loving you is like second nature
Without you I ain't breathing
Feels like I'm suffocating
Ask me to be yours and you as mine
I'm over all that playing
Words can't explain how and what you've done to me
Don't know what I did to have make this become reality
Sat down about twice to see
If I might change my mind about the way I feel
Just like I guess I couldn't stop coming back to the same old thing
All I know is that I want you honey
And Loving you is like second nature
Without you I ain't breathing
Feels like I'm suffocating
Ask me to be yours and you as mine
Over all that playing
Walked into the club with my partner
One thing led to another
My boyfriend put two and two together
Got into my ride till my man go home
I'll be back as soon as I take my girls home
He stood at the door only in his towel
One thing led to the other
He ripped my clothes up all together
Came through the door with a knife in his hands
But thank the Lord that I had a CD in my hand
But sometimes I don't know if I got what it takes to make the world come alive
But then I'll close my eyes
I put my foot upon the ground
Inside of me I find my wings
Inside of me is all I'll ever need
Sometimes you've gotta take control
Don't know what you can do or what you're capable
It's time for you to show
I'll push myself with all I've got
Don't care if you're not
This world won't give you want unless you take your shot
So give it all you got
Inside of me I find my wings
Inside of me is all I'll ever need
I'm all I'll ever need
I'm all I'll ever need
I'm all I'll ever need
Inside of me I find my wings
Inside of me I find my wings
Inside of me is all I'll ever need
I don't care what you say
Everything just comes my way
Everything just comes my way
I don't care what you say
Everything just comes my way
Everything just comes my way
I can see what you've been through
I'll pull you through
I'm the one you can run to
Over and over for you
Over and over for you
Over and over for you
I can feel your heart beating
I won't stop believing
And cherish this feeling
Over and over for you
Over and over for you
Over and over for you
You play me like a song

All the dogs grovel when I wag that tail
All the dogs grovel when I wag that tail
All the dogs grovel when I wag that tail
All the dogs grovel when I wag that tail
And though it seems we're on our own
And say a prayer to get you home
You're a million miles away
And everything I ever do
And say a prayer to get you home
We've been doing this for years you should know we stump man
For anyone of these up take a ball like a stunt man
Seeing all these other fools fading away
Take your rap for another cool game to play
Play mayhem faith any training day
Beat the half to paint tracks of we
And provide he can go faked in the streets
I put up with the 5th cause real recognize real
And on the real to real my nick is Cash Give
And dog smell my shit I gave to the crowd to dig it
5th was never been rookies coming up
On the tunnel pack your kingdom like a terrorist attack
You must be from Jupiter cause ye make me feel like a man in a rocket
You're so peculiar make me sing make me dance like a puppet now
You're so peculiar just wanna be on your planet forever now
Say hi to the past when he rolls by
If one day he won't fit your house no more
Say hi to the dude with the golden watch
Shake hands with the man who lost his touch
I hope they be fine without me
You must be from Jupiter cause ye make me feel like a man in a rocket
You're so peculiar make me sing make me dance like a puppet now
Do what you want girl
Spitting in the mike in my hand
The sea gonna way wash that symbol
There's no telling about what's the better
You can leave everything
We can leave anything
That fall down. You owe me a smile
Would be checking out your hometown
But I ain't changing my place
I ain't changing my ways
I'll be waiting for you
It's just so you'd relate
It's just somewhere to play
Need a way to say it all
Cause out the two of us you're surely
Please be patient with me
Please just wait and give me time
This side ain't me to awake
This side ain't me to abide
Then I'll try to make it work
Be the guy that you can lean on
Just a bit of time and I can
Get your big smile so we can
Running out of poetry
Don't let it take you down
Scream up from the side
Hoping you lost another round
Nobody's really far away nowadays
And we fulfill our ancient needs
Them we just see her many face
For the mission that they on
And the place that you call home
My fucking legs and feet are tired
For the grass is always greener
Than the garden of Eden
Was a fuck up for a reason
Lets write this once together
And lets not forget to read it
Just a bit of time and I can
Get your big smile so we can
Just a bit of time and I can
Get your big smile so we can
Running out of poetry
Don't let it take you down
Scream up from the side
Hoping you lost another round
Running out of poetry
Don't let it take you down
Scream up from the side
Hoping you lost another round
There's a river running low
They know how this river flows
Cause it goes back in the day and times
Back into the fighting ...
First steps to a story ...
That river is cold and make you wash away my traces back
All my tracks are gone
It takes a million years to find out where I'm coming from
Trying to embrace it all
Even now I'm so much older
Cause it feels like I'm on your shoulder
On your shoulder shoulder
Look around and think about the times that you carried naked
Close my eyes and cast you on the window in a valley ...
You're blocking my eyes and hands if
You're talking directions that you have to walk
Exactly the way that I told you to walk it
I know exactly where I come from
Trying to embrace it all
Even now I'm so much older
Cause it feels like I'm on your shoulder
No matter where I go I know I'm always on your
I don't know that much
Trying to embrace it all
Even now I'm so much older
Cause it feels like I'm on your shoulder
Julie was a girl like no other
She used to have a style that would make them boys stutter
She made me a bit more desperate to be in a band
Now she was in love with the world and in love in the game
No need for desert but a hunger for fame
But then that ball crashed into this guy
And then she kissed all the dreams goodbye
I've been thinking about all the things you could've been
And she became that lady with a belly and a baby
And the man in the Mercedes and she never rocked the stage again
I have to say I wasn't ready for the sudden changes
Love the way she played her cards like all of them were fucking Haitians
And then she kissed all his dreams goodbye
I've been thinking about all the things you could've been
She was as happy as never before
Took me so long just to see it
When I keep thinking about
I've been thinking about all the things you could've been
I've been thinking about all the things you could've been
I got a bed in a room and a house in the street
And a city in the country I know
Where I think about my problems
Cause you want my problems home
Today it was a lot of anger
And people on the planet saying
Other people did them wrong
Now while they think about themselves
Rather than living all together
On a planet that's a ticking bomb
Everybody wants to be themselves
And everybody needs a little love
And everybody needs a little help
Now I've been looking for a little bit of happiness these days
But I've been looking in the wrong places
And I've been spending all my love on the wrong types of ladies
Everybody wants to be themselves
And everybody deserve a little love
And everybody needs a little help
Just a little bit of help yo
And everybody wants to be themselves
And everybody needs to be themselves
Everybody needs just a bit of help
And everybody wants to be themselves
And everybody needs to be themselves
Everybody needs just a bit of help
Everybody wants to be themselves
And everybody deserve a little love
And everybody needs a little help
Go and live your life
I like to juggle with the right amounts of wrongs
As I'm struggling at night as I write another song
Now still young yet feeling old
Now I ain't ready for the so called fields of gold
I fell in love a million times
But man I still don't know
What I wanna be when I grow up
I don't wanna be a moneymaker
Never wanna be untrue
I wanna be just like you
Whenever people talk smart I can say some shit
Like some amazing shit
I'll be that big shot calculating
How much he be worth today
Now still young yet feeling old
I've got some dreams to live before you see me go
I been on national TV
I own a car with leather seats
And when they leave I never weep for that no
I shook the hand of the queen and still
I've got some dreams to live and I don't need regrets
I wanna be just like you
Hy it's nice meeting you
Seeing and I might be needing it
Are you alone than to bring...
There's nothing wrong if you're stepping into the zone
Well that can be a pity if I really give a fuck
I'm hot by your smell and I can't...
I don't know nights like this
I think I wanna kiss you
But I can't cause you already got a boyfriend
I don't know nights like this
I think I wanna kiss you
But I can't cause you already got a boyfriend
You already got a boyfriend
And I already got a girl
I can't afford to pay things like this
I love my miss but I hate to miss out
Our only situation that's crazy like this
See the eyes don't match
But it does what it does
And it loves what it loves
And mind can't really be controlled that much
They don't know that much
I got better ways to waste the night
I have to stop dancing with the devil inside
I don't know nights like this
I think I wanna kiss you
But I can't cause you already got a boyfriend
I don't know nights like this
I think I wanna kiss you
You're so close to me
She loves me and she comforts me
She always knows the perfect things
And I have no gaps to fill
She knows me like you never will
I don't know nights like this
Your feelings I can't resist
m stuck in my limitless
I don't know nights like this
Your feelings I can't resist
I don't know nights like this
Your feelings I can't resist
I don't know nights like this
Your feelings I can't resist
I don't know nights like this
Your feelings I can't resist
I don't know nights like this
Your feelings I can't resist
I don't know nights like this
Your feelings I can't resist
I don't know nights like this
Your feelings I can't resist
I don't know nights like this
Tell me why now people still can't take it easy
People hating for no real reason
Come down hard and crush your soul
People still afraid of freedom
But we had enough of them down the road
I got a message for you
I ain't the kind of guy to waste my time
I ain't the kind of guy to waste behind
I've been looking at the stone heat ones for fuse
I got a message for you
I got a message for you
The kind of love your momma gave you
That your momma gave you
That your momma gave you
I got a message for you
I got a message for you
I got a message for you
I got a message for you
I got a message for you
I got a message for you
I got a message for you
I got a message for you
I got a message for you
I got a message for you
Take me to the streets
It has been clear from the start
Before I lose the touch and listening
And I don't feel I wanna miss what's in your heart
I said follow me but you walked behind
I had no coat on and I walk no line
For the dark on your journey and your bright of your mind
In the bright what you just might gonna find
Before I lose the touch and listening
I don't feel I wanna miss what's in your heart
What's in your restless smile and let the present time
Trying to hide from nowhere
But you don't have to shine every time I come by
I've been working on my success
Trying to learn from my regress
Now I hope I learn all the love I get
Sometimes I give all I have
And there's really nothing left
It ain't a curse it's a blessing
All is welcome and none is needed
Before I lose the touch and listening
And I don't feel I wanna miss what's in your heart
So I don't wanna miss what's in your heart
I don't wanna go what's in your heart
I just wanna hold what's in your heart
You can show me once more
I don't wake up till the day is done
Open my eyes in the darkness
Remember all the bad things I saw
Dreams don't come for nothing
I don't wake up till the day is done
Open my eyes in the darkness
My heart asleep and my days don't end
They have never started
They have never started
They have never started
They have never started
They have never started
Part of my rock bottom
I can't see nor see you talking
Sold your soul to keep on walking
My flow is old and rusty
My soul is cold and dusty
My smile is all warn off
When I'm hot I don't trust me
In this game of fools there are many truths
Watch me bend the grooves
Turn out the music and burn it all
Turn out the music and burn it all
I don't wake up till the day is done
Open my eyes in the darkness
Remember all the bad things I saw
Dreams don't come for nothing
I don't wake up till the day is done
Open my eyes in the darkness
My heart asleep and my days don't end
They have never started
They have never started
They have never started
They have never started
They have never started
And nightmares keep on coming
There's a way in and it has me crawling
There's a light at the end of the tunnel
But if I stay right here and embrace that fear
I can hear my future calling
I got love and I can't be loving
I got hate and I can't be hating
I got stuck in a fake ass comfort zone
I can't run and I can't embrace it
I'm trying but I'm tired of sleeping
I'm tired of sleeping
I don't wake up till the day is done
Open my eyes in the darkness
Remember all the bad things I saw
Dreams don't come for nothing
I don't wake up till the day is done
Open my eyes in the darkness
My heart asleep and my days don't end
They have never started
They have never started
They have never started
They have never started
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
You got nowhere to hide
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
Hardcore carnivore waiting for the Arctic call
Tell them what it happened and ask him what he got installed
If you ain't gonna finish it
Just got angry on McDonald
The cops are busting my ass
I felt my pockets were muffins
I just love it and rub it
But they call me and punch me in the stomach
And I'm coughing them nuggets
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
You got nowhere to hide
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
You got nowhere to hide
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for

Never begged for compliments
Flip that script I'm just a
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
You got nowhere to hide
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
You got nowhere to hide
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
You got nowhere to hide
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
You got nowhere to hide
There is a fine line between the two of us
We can't be talking down that long like intellectuals
We all laughing but not really laughing
We all cashing but not really cashing
Labeled your eyes for Scandinavian fashion
But really we be flipping out waiting in traffic
So raise your glasses with grapes organic
There is a fine line between the two of us
We can't be talking down that long like intellectuals
We used to copy all the right kind of folk
Stop you on the road when you lost control
Some wake up in a brand new Bugatti
Let's wake up in bed with some juicy cocky
There is a fine line between the two of us
We can't be talking down that long like intellectuals
Lost in our own world
Lost in our own world
Know you feel the same
Lost in our own world
I see diamonds in your back
Lost in our own world
But I don't feel what I know
But my mind ain't in control
And it's the heart I need to listen to
And it's been singing songs for tender dreams
But when you sang to help us sleep
And one day I will sing those songs
Sing them till they sleep
Just like you sang to me
From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
In your arms I feel safe
From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
And I'll miss you till I'm old
And love is my compass still yeah
Love will fill the holes I've got
Cause you let us sing to sleep
You let us sing your heart to sleep
And I know that you are with me
And I know that you have peace
Doc's can't fix the shit when I'll be pretty fucking dead
Please don't feed my ego I don't feel that shitty need
I'm a bad seed indeed just let me smoke my weed
The word is a tool fool we have to use it
The final countdown can't wait
Don't be so fucking friendly
When I take the lead I see you catch speed
A long ways from home I bring you another other
I won't stop until I'm through with this
Don't get opened up like a fucking dutch
Somebody call my baby
Somebody call her up real quick
I think I need my fix
Always around to please me
Always around to take control
But she feels so clean
Well she craves affection
And I know she loves me
You're just a little girl now
You're just a girl who misses her dad
And all the toys that she had
Thought I could make you older
Thought I could keep you out of harm
But now you're caught in my arms
But she feels so clean
Well she craves affection
And I know she loves me
Now that we've made it this far
Now that we've made a mess in the car
You ought to give it a rest
But she feels so clean
Well she craves affection
And I know she loves me

And I know she loves me
Somebody call my baby

Spending my time on a girl I know
Spending my time on a girl I know
But she's on the prowl
She grabs all the cash from the paper stash
Spending my time on a girl I know
Spending my time on a girl I know
But she's on the prowl
She grabs all the cash from the paper stash
Everyone wanna get a piece of what I got today
So you can really ball
But you should never try to walk
Until you learn to crawl
Don't wanna hold your hand
But I don't think you understand
Don't you tell me what to do
Yeah I'm going on my own
Don't you tell me what to say
Well I'm going on my own
Every time that you get me on the line it's all the same
So you can really ball
But you should never try to walk
Until you learn to crawl
Don't wanna hold your hand
But I don't think you understand
So you can really ball
But you should never try to walk
Until you learn to crawl
Don't wanna hold your hand
I never hung around with so many nuts
Who doesn't wanna shop at Dior
So come inside and lock that hotel door
I wanna learn a little more
You're my Puerto Rican Pamela Lee
And I'm here and I'm now
And I'm chasing the charts
Now you know that I been locked up in school
And you might be everything that I need
But maybe I just need to get wild
And I been waiting so long that it hurts
I only want what I deserve
All I wanted was to be seen
Let's cut our losses move it along
Spending my time on a girl I know
Spending my time on a girl I know
But she's on the prowl
She grabs all the cash from the paper stash
Time to unwind for a minute
But you're locked away at night
And I hold the urge inside but it's not gone
I won't say something clever
And I beg you please for the birds and bees
But it won't last forever
But those eyes in your head
Well they butter all my bread
And I'm looking for a girl who feeds me well
Time to unwind for a minute
Time to unwind for a minute
Time to unwind for a minute
You're fresh to death
But you've turned your tricks
And the fingers of your mind
Have wrapped around my spine
And made me feel so blind
But my tongue is tied
And no matter what you do
Just please don't say we're through
Always close the blinds
You can say what you will
In a town that is brown
That's suburban flight
Live between her thighs
Well I've been fooled
And I've fooled around
About where I'm bound
There won't be no time to burn
Burn through the night
There won't be no time to burn
The names and the fridge
Are gonna have to wait their turn
Yeah I'm coming for the sun
I've got to get some rest
Won't you cover my face
And it is time to go home
Mother feels so alone
Scared straight to hell
There won't be no time to burn
The names and the fridge
Are gonna have to wait their turn
Yeah I'm coming for the sun
I've got to get some...
Won't you cover my face
And it is time to go home
Mother feels so alone
Won't you make me up nice
Before I get out of town
There is barely a sound
Everybody knows this song
But why did it take so long
Now your children they are grown
Wearing makeup and cologne
Working's tired out your eyes
Days are turning into years
What a wonderful career
Now your children they are grown
And your wife is all alone
It's time to find out where you're at
Always were just out of reach
I'm hung up again on a peach
I try to say what I gotta say
I try to do what I gotta do
Than I ever thought you should know
So maybe it's best if I go
My thoughts are changing
Not shy but rearranging
Can't touch my feelings
Somebody call my baby
Somebody call her up real quick
I think I need my fix
Always around to please me
Always around to take control
But she feels so clean
Well she craves affection
And I know she loves me
You're just a little girl now
You're just a girl who misses her dad
And all the toys that she had
Thought I could make you older
Thought I could keep you out of harm
But now you're caught in my arms
But she feels so clean
Well she craves affection
And I know she loves me
Now that we've made it this far
Now that we've made a mess in the car
You ought to give it a rest
But she feels so clean
Well she craves affection
And I know she loves me
Well she craves affection
And I know she loves me
Turn day into the night
More coffee down the drain
But got nothing yet to show
I had to read the facts
Can't sleep until I'm done
But at that time the sun
You're never ever gonna find me
I need to get some sleep
I'm dying to leave the work behind me
I need to get some...
Turn night into the day
We're cold but we're alive
But got nothing yet to show
That's just the way it goes
And some just stay awake
No time to take a break
Or escape into a dream
There are a lot of lonely people
And even lining up outside the club
And if you wanna meet a girl then you should
And just find somebody's mommy who can squeeze you
So you might as well come play.
Now every time I see a dime I ask myself
No one's ever gonna find us
No one's ever gonna find us
So you might as well come play.
But I know I could be your son.
No one's ever gonna find us
So you might as well come play.
No one's ever gonna find us
Being broke in school ain't really the plan
Money make a bitch fuck a geek on command
But let me tutor you on how to get your math right
You see the law students like to play with they nose
And with the frat boys I hear anything goes
Spot the psych major by the weed that he blows
And you save all the ex for them cheerleader hoes
District attorney or dumb ass
I bet you've never been out on a date like this before
And then you know we're going bowling
You're in my world and
Or continue this inside
But once you get to the door
We're gonna have a little fun
Stay on the bed until the morn
But underneath it all I know you're sexual
So we can start this on the sectional
Show you the bedroom when I see it's time
Then continue this inside
I pop open my cargo hatch
RIP to Jack Tripper better known as Sweet Jones
We so high up in the air that we can't even see home
I'm riding an elephant straight through outer space
There are laser beams shooting out my face
I'm riding an elephant straight through outer space
Got laser beams shooting out my face
Right now its time to have a talk
Excuse me while I kiss the sky
Please pardon my chester French
Animals be understanding you
Riding through one elephant
I don't know if weed enough
In the shower for about an hour
And when I wipe it off
I hardly recognize the face
But I hardly recognize the place
I'm riding an elephant straight through outer space
There are laser beams shooting out my face
I'm riding an elephant straight through outer space
Got laser beams shooting out my face
I used to smoke a bit
But then I got over it
Sometimes its as permanent as a burn victim
Cavemen and tycoons could be seen in a scuffle
While hands with no bodies are so eager to touch you
Ironic I can pull a L but can't push a T
I'm riding an elephant straight through outer space
There are laser beams shooting out my face
I'm riding an elephant straight through outer space
Everyday feels the same
Its time to move away
But me and my girls wanna get it on
Then I just looked up like she said it wrong
This played out in my mind a long time ago
In the hills we all take pills
We even have designer drugs like strawberry sniff
Bitch you plastic your girls is plastic
Everyday feels the same
Its time to move away
Its kinda hard not to get caught up
Lotta fly shit to be bought up
And the ladies act crazy
Cause that's just the way they brought up
And that's when she asked me had I ever did the nasty
Everyday feels the same
The girls I used to chase round
Were nothing but looks
Now I'm reading you Dostoevsky
And you're doing my math
An extraordinary mind
Brain is of a kind so unknown
The metal in your smile makes you shine
Hello how nice to meet you
I wear tiny suits and bow ties
Some might call me strange
Most guys don't enlighten me
But I'm intrigued by you
But now I'm riding you
An extraordinary mind
Brain is of a kind so unknown
The metal in your smile makes you shine
Reading comics in the dark
Love your awkward little walk
Chester French beside me...
Mom walked out the front door
Girl walked through the back
Dick fell to the floor
Parents gone for the weekend
Hit that the first time out
That's 14 days of unsupervised sex
So I say a prayer then I gotta let fun begin
Ain't no parents allowed
Ain't no parents allowed
So New York like a taxi cab
I can't front I'm attracted to all the fake boobs
And see I get it on the monthly
I'm so ill sell water to the ocean
Maybe no parents around isn't such a good idea after all...
Ain't no parents allowed
And you must understand
Get up and clap your hands
Buckle down and feel the seismic shift
Of the party inside my pants
Take a glance at your desperate soul
Lose control and add on my trance
We're here to show you motherfuckers the reason
We get paid up front in bricks of gold
So get familiar with the way that this feels
Open up your mouth and swallow us whole
Ready to lay some pipe
Under my purple lights
I bet you never felt you might hand clap
Shake the shoes right off your feet
We decorate and excavate your house
Put your family back out on the street
We're here to show you motherfuckers the reason
We get paid up front in bricks of gold
So get familiar with the way that this feels
Open up your mouth and swallow us whole
We're here to welcome...
But we must warn you...
Shit could fuck with your mind
We're here to welcome...
But we must warn you...
Shit could fuck with your mind
We're here to show you motherfuckers the reason
We get paid up front in bricks of gold
So get familiar with the way that this feels
We're so bad we know we're good
We're not here to start no trouble
We're just here to do the Super Bowl Shuffle
We've had the goal since training camp
To give Chicago a Super Bowl chance
We didn't come here to look for trouble
We just came here to do
The Super Bowl Shuffle
I practice all day and dance all night
I got to get ready for the Sunday fight
Now I'm as smooth as a chocolate swirl
There's not one here that does it like me
My Super Bowl Shuffle will set you free
I just came to do The Super Bowl Shuffle
We're so bad we know we're good
We're not here to start no trouble
We're just here to do the Super Bowl Shuffle
I just throw my body all over the field
That's why you all got here on the double
The ladies all love me
For my body and my mind
I'm slick on the floor as I can be
But ain't no sucker gonna get past me
Some guys are jealous
Of my style and class
I just get down to The Super Bowl Shuffle
I'm not here to feather his ruffle
I just came here to do
The Super Bowl Shuffle
I fly on the field and get on down
Everybody knows I don't mess around
So please don't cry to beat my hustle
The Super Bowl Shuffle
We're so bad we know we're good
We're not here to start no trouble
We're just here to do the Super Bowl Shuffle
If the quarterback's slow
We love to play for the world's best fans
Your Super Bowl plans
But don't get ready or go to any trouble
The Super Bowl Shuffle
Don't know what they mean
They throw it long and watch me run
Buddy's guys cover it down to the bone
That's why they call us the 46 zone
Come on everybody let's scream and yell
I just came here to do
The Super Bowl Shuffle
We're so bad we know we're good
We're not here to start no trouble
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Bought a big house and a whole lot of rangers
A fresh new couch and a whole lot of trainers
A closet full of clothes and some brand new dangers
Some Mexican floral arrangers
A great big TV that'll entertain us
Some colorful commissions for some high paid painters
Someone to take the wrap so that I stay stainless
A new relationship with a banker
A trained German Shepard that bark when it's angered
To watch my possessions and look out for strangers
A 50 foot yacht with an anchor
Young supermodel that shall remain nameless
The more you try to erase me
The more that You appear
Lifestyles of the broke and famous
Let you know how crazy this game is
Look at all the new beautiful faces
Long for their shot on the TV screens
American Idol never seen these dreams
Just last week they want to see ID
How many people almost famous
You almost remember what they name is
I try to keep that balance
After MTV that's a Real World Challenge
Never to be heard from again
The more you try to erase me
The more that You appear
I bring a burning sensation to the urban eye
But the earth got gas once it burps its fine
Someone around me they talk about the grease
Wrong place wrong time
Look at him no blemish
Egg shell off white like a DuPont finish
Cause who knew that day that man would just
What a way to see the cover of Time
The more you try to erase me
I would've been here sooner
I would've been here sooner
But I was caught up in the hoes
Caught up in the cars
Caught up in the money
Caught up in the life
Hit the court and drop 40
It's hot up in the kitchen turn the fan up
I would've been here sooner
I would've been here sooner
But I was caught up in the hoes
Caught up in the cars
Caught up in the money
Caught up in the life
It's hot up in the kitchen turn the fan off
I would've been here sooner
I would've been here sooner
But I was caught up in the hoes
Caught up in the cars
Caught up in the money
Caught up in the life
Drew the perfect portrait now I'm hanging up the picture
Drinking out the faucet that's equated with the riches
Came from the bottom sewer
Hit the gun range practice aiming at a witness
Boys in the hood still drinking juice
Everything that happened in these streets god planned em
Snatch the soul out your punk ass make you touch grass
Came up swapped the sardines for the salmon
Still watching cameras trafficking the balance
Air your dirty laundry keep your eyes on your hammer
Them shoes ain't your size
Leave with your bitch in Atlanta
Now we be packing arenas
Driven in all of this gold
Then if I do it I don't
One shell fits on cap sizes
For them M's you stack thousands
Pussy ass judge got the nerve
When the coke boy drop make the floor shake
Got the whole block sewn up
Hundred deep inside the club
Head shot paramedics come and get ya
Gone after pills and a couple of liquor
Got the whole block sewn up
Hundred deep inside the club
That's just what they told me
Pull up and we shut the whole block down
Everything designer from the top down
She will open wide like a Great White
With them bird flue was a safe line
What the combination to yo safe locks
Got the whole block sewn up
Hundred deep inside the club
We move that work right from off of the playground
They hit your chest and yo head with that K round
Down to go to war for the spread
We move that work right from off of the playground
They hit your chest and yo head with that K round
Stay on the porch and finish school first
We move that work right from off of the playground
They hit your chest and yo head with that K round
I'll be counting all of this paper
Smoking all of this dope
Told me wasn't no hope
Add the grease to that chicken
Bitch in less than 4 minutes
I got freezer burn on my left arm
Gas hoes like Chevron
Skin made of that Kevlar
Made my way up off them blocks
Talking Coke Boy let's get it
I'm in traffic ducking that sentence
Found that pot of gold and dove in it
Seen the lane and I took it
Dress warm its cold out
Hard top roof fall out
Too fast bitch slow down
We ride through your street
Told her told use no teeth
Came a long way from that bottom
We don't fuck with them in the first place
They know I get the pussy on the first date
I thought you knew that
I left the club with your lady
Came in here smelling like money
Most love the scent of my cologne
Had to shoot him twice in the dome
Sweet under age pussy like an offer
I be acting weird for the money
I left the club with your lady
My plug just gave a hundred pounds of some birds
My whip was a hundred thou
I left the club with your lady
We do this for the mother fucking streets
This shit right here forever
When you staring at a barrel of a nine millimeter
Twenty pointers in the chain
When you staring in the eyes of a young drug dealer
Stacking up the money like I'm Jewish
Pull up in the mint two seater
Roll up to the front all the hoes want in
Got the party jumping when the record hit the needle
Fans going crazy like I came with the Beetles
The bread make the ends I'll be coming through the speaker
Shit gone get lit when I finish recording
God Damn I am awesome
Put you in the creek like Dawson
I'm giving out late abortions
You know I'm not lying
You spit like a goblin
I'm keeping it rolling
That's why my pockets is swollen
And my momma eyes is so swollen
Ma please wipe yo eyes
We hardly can talk on the phone
Because I'm on the rise
I'm busy getting that dough and
So I can get her a new home and
Too much ground to cover
I don't know where to start
Can't find the words to tell you
I don't know where to start
What ya gonna do when them boys come
Knocking at your front door
It was cold on that corner
I know you hear me on your radio
I know you watch me in the video
So we'll sit here in the silence
And watch the sun go down
And wonder if we'll ever
Meet again on higher ground
What ya gonna do when them boys come
Knocking at your front door
So we'll sit here in the silence
And watch the sun go down
And wonder if we'll ever
Meet again on higher ground

Knocking at your front door

To the lessons of professors

Ride round LA blowing them trees
Who sell trees so I can pay rent for her

Took me running from police on the concrete
Without scuffing my Timberland or Nike
They call me King of the concrete
Who said they really wanna get
They just wanna see why
All they girlfriends be wanting pictures
Worth a hundred hundred stacks
Till I hit a hundred sacks
Although that's a given
I ain't even gotta mint chain
I'm just a young fresh fly
And I ain't even gotta tell a lie
From the shoes on the cool
Pimp tight get it right homey more or less
Gotta thank god I'm fresh
Candy paint the rag top
I'm country till decease
I stay up on my creep so to come up
She fine as she wannabe
But she wanna check though
Like the hoes was working with the law

She had to be like a size 5 or 6
She was like ooh baby I don't work here
N she asked if I had a pen

Crushed your heart in the palm of my hands

And girl it's like round and round we go
Hearts will prefer if you left me alone
And now my heartbeat feels like a 808
I'm a walking disaster
Destruction like fire all around you
Crushed your heart in the palm of my hand
If you walk out baby I'll understand
No lights in my bag no eye sight
I've been talking about my new diamond rings
Because my new diamond rings there the shit
But I still take walks in my ends
14 when I entered the game
All I wanted was a little bit of fame
Go mad like shit I forgot my age
Oh chipmunk your so cute
And you usually call this rabbit food
And the sales is custom made
No water involved I pay
Good lord I remember the days
I've been talking about my new diamond rings
Because my new diamond rings there the shit
You going to be listening to them
Aye uh see I'm such a classy guy
Designer shades hide my eyes
I look good with a face like mine
How the hell could I be camera shy
I make it look easy man
Got my middle finger up to the world
I could turn your house into mine
And never let a bitch take my shine
I've been talking about my new diamond rings
Because my new diamond rings there the shit
Cause there the swagger that you see in my walk
Money is the motive everyday I want my grands up
I weren't the kid in class front row with my hands up
But somehow I still pass
Hit yard and still bar
Commercial incredible I mouth off
Time is of the essence you boys can't smell it
I put it down for the wishing
A sixteen verse turn your song into mine
Odd thoughts in my brain
Puff dope at six and I'm still peaking
Pissed off half the game
I never made an album for the cheese
Besides I do as I please
Jeez Louise Julius cease the beat
First link sees the beat
I don't know what you heard about me
But don't leave your girl around me
But I wear with money on my hands
Inc made me I get a hit
And the ice doesn't freeze my drinks
So I put me some in the rink
Ya got money over here
The other thing that I'm in is intelligent
Pyrotechnic I play with fire
And I have everything they require
I'm the head of flash kids
My foot's down on the pedal
So how you gonna finish me
That coke ladder to infinity
And tip toe on top of it
Then I took my sound and spread it over ground
Yes I'm leveling over clouds
I'm on top but holding it down
The kings sat in his throne
My heads to big for a crown
L o l you can laugh out loud
S o s they wanna send out
Oh I'm coming from under the ground
Tonight I'm coming up to take it down
I'm free coming deep from the sleep
I roll around grinning my teeth
Yeah I am the prettiest beast
4 years down the line I'm here
4 years down the line your there
I just laugh at those who strayed off
I became that beast with this heart
I aim for the movement
You hear me and know that the swaggers to hard
They can hear the fire in me on the stations
Oh I'm coming from under the ground
Tonight I'm coming up to take it down
I'm free coming deep from the sleep
I was the underdog on the underground
They was laughing at me then but you tell me who's laughing now
I'm proof that underdogs can make it
If you get that chance then take it
Don't let talent get wasted
I'm the product of the streets
With some anger and some beats
You took me of the leash
Oh I'm coming from under the ground
Tonight I'm coming up to take it down
I'm free coming deep from the sleep
If you can't find your way look for me
And once he goes I'm next
So right like I don't know left
And I ain't trying to be the R E S T
Replace the R and throw me a B
So don't spend ya life trying to find
Something that's in front of your eyes
You can spend a whole life time trying to find the answer
I'll be right here with a helping hand out for you
And if you can't find your way
If you can't find your way
If you can't find your way look for me
Ain't no weave I'm really hair
A wise man told me persevere
To elevate me in my career
I just do what needs be
You can spend a whole life time trying to find the answer
I'll be right here with a helping hand out for you
And if you can't find your way
If you can't find your way
If you can't find your way look for me
If you can't find your way look for me
See I'm the one to look for
You ain't gotta look far
I work hard like stuff the haters
Took all the stairs no escalators
And my pen kept on passing papers
Cold When I Needed One
Trying to keep bringing them hits
Cause my dreams got legs so I'm chasing it
You can spend a whole life time trying to find the answer
I'll be right here with a helping hand out for you
And if you can't find your way
If you can't find your way
If you can't find your way look for me
Trust me I'm the one to put your money on
Yes I clocked every snake but remains social
Unlike some their time won't come
I'll be in this limelight until my life is done
If she's done she'll probably give it up but
Not all decisions made are made by management
There's just a couple man that man don't need around me
True love you got for man then you won't take offense
Prove it but they know who did this
The fits got his pictures
Another eye with the street boy features
You know me I'd rather take it
Them man they're some jokers
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
If I had all the money in the world
And know look I lost me a winner
Sitting there singing this song like
You never know what you've got till it's gone like
Now we're done before we even started
Didn't know how much I missed you
I didn't know how much I missed you
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
And look still I'm here
She left me with no idea
How you took off quicker than my career. it's kinda rare
For a man to admit when he's in the wrong
And I know this ain't helping me change
And I'm sitting here singing this song like
You never know what you've got till it's gone like
Now we're done before we even started
Didn't know how much I missed you
I didn't know how much I missed you
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm too stressed and I'm trying not to flip
I close my eyes and you're inside my lids
So I try not to blink for one split sec
I didn't know how much I missed you
Now we're done before we even started
I didn't know how much I missed you
I didn't know how much I missed you
Young and easy in front of the camera making all the
Lord knows when I started writing bars never ever
I was too fast learning to rhyme now talent got me
Chart topper everybody know my name but the hood
In them history books so you can see how history looks
Watch the sea fly past with a jet pack
Music makes me fly and my friends keep me grounded
There is no doubt we'll get remembered
In them history books so you can see how history looks
In them history books so you can see how history looks
In them history books so you can see how history looks
You can say I made a transition.
You can say I made a transition.
Aiming for the top and I am not stopping
And I was never blinded by the lights
But I've always had stars in my eyes
So whether open or closed my vision's in line
And maybe that's the reason why
Everybody else is just following me
Everybody else is just following me
The vocabs are stubbing
And I was never blinded by the lights
But I've always had stars in my eyes
So whether open or closed my vision's in line
And maybe that's the reason why
Everybody else is just following me
Everybody else is just following me
I didn't wanna be the boy with the rhymes
That spent years in the game but never made no clout
Everybody else is just following me
Everybody else is just following me
Everybody else is just following me
Everybody else is just following me
You know we flying high
Ten bottles today man
Let's drink to and spray 8
Or in a hater's damn face
Might fly to Barbados
I'm running this jungle
Yeah I can rock a crowd
You know we flying high
You know we flying high
Still putting on for my team
And all the girls like me
I keep it so cool but I am no fool
And you know I can rock a crowd
You know we flying high
You know we flying high
You know we flying high
Some people have to learn
Some people wait their turn
Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives
Whenever they say you can't take the c off
I remember when they told me I wouldn't be famous
Now my dream and reality's simultaneous
And there's a higher level than the top
Or even getting lucky
So you gotta fill the hunger in your tummy
I'm always pushing myself to the limit
Making sure I stay ahead
From the words you said
Some people have to learn
Some people wait their turn
I was born a champion
Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives
Some people don't believe
But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion
I used to see my momma getting beat down
And I be lying if I say it ain't get to me
I'm always pushing myself to the limit
Making sure I stay ahead
From the words you said
Some people have to learn
Some people wait their turn
I was born a champion
Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives
Some people don't believe
But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion
Build the foundation with the bricks they've thrown
From the words you said
Some people have to learn
Some people wait their turn
I was born a champion
Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives
Some people don't believe
But I was born a champion
Some people have to learn
Some people wait their turn
I was born a champion
Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives
Some people don't believe
But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion
The clock kept ticking I just moved with the times.
I make it something hot.
My mouth wasn't born with a silver spoon in
Not everybody made it in the hood I grew in
I'm still so young but I've achieved so much
I'm the shampoo above ya
Yeah head and shoulder
All I really know is how to be myself
I never tried to change my image just to sell
I wanted to be famous
I wanted to have trainers
Used to save up for a pair now I buy the whole shelf
A lot of things have changed since back in the day
The best child line I got now is my face
One man soldier in my own now
Check... check it... listen...
I am not and postman prick
I don't need to know what your postcode is
But you can't ask the last man who violated
You are not G's you are not flees
And certainly are not me
And if it ain't CM you got the letters wrong
Cash more ovation we going hard
Fuck the alphabet minus AR
Your hands on the steering wheel
And it's steering me wrong
Can't you feel me here
You know you need to come home
You keep looking at me but your keeping me on
Perfect fit but I'm starting to slip
And I hope my grip is strong enough because
You got me wrapped around your finger
If I'm your woman then be a man
I must have been in the way
Of you keeping your promise
She's running her hand across your chest
I know she feels me close to your heart
You got me wrapped around your finger
If I'm your woman then be a man
Please don't make the biggest mistake of your life
So don't let five minutes undo your commitment
You got me wrapped around your finger
If I'm your woman then be a man
You got me wrapped around your finger
If I'm your woman then be a man
You got me wrapped around your finger
If I'm your woman then be a man
From the age of 10 I used to do a paper round
Just so I could see the paper round
And buy sweets till my teeth would rot
I never knew what I wanted to be
But I knew what the man above wanted for me
Things are different so
Don't you take this shit for granted
When the money's in your hand yeah
I might have to try this out
Good at English but I hate reading
My story's inspirational
And with the right help I can execute this out to the nations
Or my words can lock down the pavement
But damn I gotta make some
Things are different so
Don't you take this shit for granted
When the money's in your hand yeah
If you ever knew what was getting sold
Just so we can pay for videos
Things are different so
Don't you take this shit for granted
And they would all come to lie
If we all have dreams we'd be story eyes
And we would all come to lie
Like I wonder if this company still got my CV
But this pocket full of dreams ain't buying me what I need
They say I should have loved this paper
And they would all come to lie
If we all have dreams we'd be story eyes
And we would all come to lie
But ain't nobody hear my screams
But the Lord's the only person that see me on my knees
Some get left behind who don't move with the time
And they would all come to lie
If we all have dreams we'd be story eyes
And we would all come to lie
Now the reason that you fell ain't because you never climbed
Now you're looking at your legs trying to work out where you stand
Caught up to your imagination running faster than your legs
Now I feel I need to live before I end up lifeless
I'm trying to buy the time even though it's priceless
Dealing with the precious in the game
Like I know that it's my decade
And they would all come to lie
If we all have dreams we'd be story eyes
And we would all come to lie
And I'd be telling you white lies
In the beginning we are seeing we are
In the beginning we are seeing we are
There ain't a bulletproof needed for none of these shots
Or can I get a from the front
Heaven sent bring in hell too
She smelling my neck that's channel blue
Do they smile gully side boo
She said she's got a man a mister break the rules
Might just imagine all the things that we can do
That you're well dress so
Grinding on me like she looking for a beat
In the beginning we are seeing we are
In the beginning we are seeing we are
And them balls to coming on me apartment
I told her wait I miss you tossed in
I'm 6 4 she something sweet
She whispered in my ear she wants me in her archive
Grinding on me like she's looking for a beat
In the beginning we are seeing we are
In the beginning we are seeing we are
In the beginning we are seeing we are
In the beginning we are seeing we are
Never thought id see the day when you wasn't by my side.
Listen I was down for you girl put you first in my world
And I thought you were down too right
Yes it's what I'm meant for
And we ain't quite the same as we used to be
Never thought id see the day when you wasn't by my side.
Listen I was down for you girl put you first in my world
And I thought you were down too right
If it ain't a push forward it's a slow down
It's best that I go now rather than later
I don't think anybody breaks up on good terms
Never thought id see the day when you wasn't by my side.
Listen I was down for you girl put you first in my world
And I thought you were down too right
They always ask me if I'm single in interviews
I was too scared to say I'm into you. moving like a single dude
Didn't ever lie but I skipped the truth
On my own feeling like I've got a point to prove
Hungry but I don't wanna have my cake and eat it too
A musical genius I should write speeches
Anytime that me and Wretch are on the beat
Let the single pop when its chart time
Let the pricks all tell me who the one is
If I never done well you might have never heard the rest
Anytime me and Wretch are on the beat
And there ain't no liar in me
Anytime me and Wretch are on the beat
You gotta visualize this
So that I could freeze the talk I didn't wanna hear
There's nothing you could do to cause a bother
Getting on Lizzie while they getting on me
My teen life wasn't normal so my twenties won't be
Sometimes the negativity hurts
As they all sit and scrutinize my words
Picture me sitting at the window staring off into my dreams
So put me down I'll pick myself up
Loose my hands before I reach out for help blood
Cut my nose off to spite my face and still look pretty
I used to dream to be in this position
But one thing I never lack is vision
Lost myself for a minute but not my ambition
And the only way is up
Picture me sitting at the window staring off into my dreams
Picture me sitting at the window staring off into my dreams
Picture me wishing I could be on top for the world to see
That's what you gotta picture
From hills high in heaven
You see the music business is like the devil's games
If you play then you might adopt devil's ways
It's an eye for an eye a tooth the same
I'm tired of everybody taking shots up my name
I am just shooting for my targets
Look if you've been shooting yourself in the foot
Don't hold me hostage ...
Making what doesn't sell then you complaining when it doesn't sell
I am never going back to the press
Though they wanna see me stress
Counting money and staying relevant
Make me know the difference between family and relatives
I beg the Lord show me a path
Snakes are in my blood line and not in my grass
Not talking to my match
Cut my family in half
If you reap what you sow
Please take me to a level where heaven is above
Try sitting at my past so Heaven is must
With the world on my shoulders I better press the cane
You know the Lord is my Shepherd
So I can't go without praying
The prayers I need them
The good in me is leaking
I only put this pen down so they can see Jesus
To show them I believe in
Little change of maze
Got them questioning my faith
My visions strange when they negatively name me
They couldn't work out my letters so they hung me
I've been fired alive
How could you burn me
My confidence is made of titanium
Especially like I was born in a manger manger
Who is as humble as me
As long as I've got a number
Please take me to a level where heaven is above
Try sitting at my past so Heaven is must
With the world on my shoulders I better press the cane
You know the Lord is my Shepherd
So I can't go without praying
Looking back like look what the deal did
Still with the same circle
And I'm still with Chip
I swear I who share the last pound will
Is the same people I share my mill with
Six zero's in my last mill with
Bread and wine last supper was some real shit
The prayers been sent down and ready
Tell my chick don't leave me now
Tell my feet don't fail me now
It's too late I'm in front of this crowd
I drown in my own sweat before they take me out
Take the jewels take the fame
Take the buzz take the name
But the talent still remains
Tell the hater change of plan
I tell the label drop me still on weeks we all run
Piss off this ain't a big trap
This is seat for a gift wrap
Back from the future you plums
Fighting in advance for the apologies to come
Eat a plate of fame of vomit
Still reaping for the hungry
Heads shots with shots and bullets
Believe me the floors tight but the jeans ain't
You can't compromise these days
I open doors into the blame frame
Its about time I do me and get paid for it
So fuck a market and plan
So pray for me and play your position...
Take your best shot bullets wont stop me
Back to bars now I know you thought you lost me
I keep a pow with a stick no bamboo
I pass through any hood like I'm shank proof
Focus on what you can't I'm proof on what you can do
Second time round I'm going hard making music from the heart pray it wriggles in the charts
To bags a loan and this fly shit I standing
I do it right still prepared to go wrong
They still stumble words when the camera goes on
Listen you don't wanna have it out with me you know I'll strip you for your confidence keep your clothes
Its real friends in a fake business
Team UK we on a mad ting
American girls they love my accent
A thin line between love and hate is what I walk on
And every song I ever dropped was a right move
From the underground but came from the right too
I'm putting power moves for the year
Type of idiot to hate before you hear
I'm always pushing myself to the limit
Making sure I stay ahead
Some people have to learn
Some people wait their turn
Some people but not me
I was born a champion
Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives
Some people don't believe
I was born a champion
But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion
And I'd be lying if I said it ain't get to me
Rules made to be broken like an Oreo in life
I took a dollar to the city of the dreams
When we starving they won't feed us
Couldn't get a booking
Couldn't get a push in when you needed a shove
Or your buttons they be pushing
It's only you believing in you
They turn you into a bastard than moment you rude
Attitude a little out of tune
But that's how champions move
Yeah so go and get it in sunny
Not everybody gets a second chance at getting money
Or even getting lucky
I'm power trip on the long way road
Like kid whatever I say goes at
Means whatever I say moves and trust me
They say prove it ... put it out sweet
... From the streets so you know what I ain't should be
I could tell the ... on a drink.
I'm on a power trip to the place where I go
I'm on a power trip to the place where I go
But I know where I'm ... come vision.
I'm on a power trip to the place where I go
I'm on a power trip to the place where I go
Time for toys and time for cheer.
Please Christmas don't be late.
Please Christmas don't be late.
Please Christmas don't be late.
And they would all come to lie
If we all have dreams we'd be story eyes
And we would all come to lie
And they would all come to lie
If we all have dreams we'd be story eyes
And we would all come to lie
And they kick you when you dancing now the trick is to stay up
Some get left behind who don't move with the time
And they would all come to lie
If we all have dreams we'd be story eyes
And we would all come to lie
Now the reason that you fell ain't because you never climbed
Now you're looking at your legs trying to work out where you stand
Caught up to your imagination running faster than your legs
Now I feel I need to live before I end up lifeless
I'm trying to buy the time even though it's priceless
Dealing with the precious in the game
And they would all come to lie
If we all have dreams we'd be story eyes
And we would all come to lie
The dark it comes to light yeah
And I'd be telling you white lies
The dark it comes to light yeah
Yeah I'd be telling you white lies
16 year old MC trooper
I'm still down for c dot m's
Der no dilly no dally in music
I'm more den hot for my age
Can't stop for a break
Like let alone stop for a day
Ur a spade I'm an ace
I am in a league of my own
But I still move on my own
Swing down sweet chariot
He told that sweet chariot to swing on down
Now this is what we do
Before the shots ring out
People never seen or even heard
Well it's the ninth inning
With two outs I hit a home run to left field like Carter did to Philly
I'm making ladies back flip
Understand it's all about the Sexual eating up your set like a tropical
Twenty One years was ground work
If you wanna get down then we can all just
All my people throw your hands up high and just
All my people from uptown to downtown just
From the Florida Keys to Fiji just
If you try to check for flaws
See I don't care what you people think or say
Don't care about a thing
No one can rock a beat just like I
All my dames in sexy belly chains just
Hard rock's coming but they always come frail
Now look in the mirror
Body looked like it was wrapped in saran
But there ain't nothing wrong
Hitting in morning till we strong grown
And we strong moan and waking up the block
Don't dwell on these minor details
Plus your tight skirt be flashing your thong
And one for this chick standing next to me
See I was peeping your style
So they ready try to score
I chill on the humble in my jeans and steel toes
Body looking strong like Cadillac designs
And then invites me to her humble abode
Says she loves prospects and talks about her fetish
I be closing every night and take it straight to the dome
So we could rule the world or you could stay at home
See this is for my ladies in open toed shoes
And belly chains that make money and like their sex sweaty
Like the sex messy and ready to go
And not afraid to peel off the thong
And not afraid to take it straight to the dome
And for my dogs that make laws and cruise offshore
And take no crumb cake to clear out the bars
Watch yourself girl when you're playing it close
Uh... T dot O to the N dot Y
Can you believe this how we lock y'all
You can spark with or talk with
You talk heartless but game straight harmless
Leave your fingers harmless
Kicked out the Thompson Hall through Apollo doors
Hit you dead in the head now
My hunger gotta get fed now
My style's similar to a fierce knuckle hit
Rap so exact that you can't do shit
Now it's the skinny man dropping this
Wild like the lion's mane walking through the rain
Or walking through the pain of critic suffering
Got my eyes on the prize with the red dot locked
That's to keep it hot
Look into the eyes of the man that will be detrimental to your career
You know they want our type of species to become extinct
Always up to par when I spar
Rap so exact that you can't do shit
Trying to run with the Suave Dogs
I kinda just be floating on peoples
I be looking right at you
I be spilling milk ridiculous indeed
I rock stages low grounds to high floors
You're fucking with the wrong man and the wrong plan
These hating people always trying to put some things on me
But I do what I do I never sway to be no fades
And these ladies with these nice thighs got me hypnotized
To T Dot the O making moves like Rambo
Flow comes heavily now listen
I keep it tight like virgins on they first night
With some brothers who be stressing no question
I turn your bitch ass to hush puppies
But no drama though I cruise right through the paranormal
And give love like dominoes
Understand the fact when I rap it's all about the illy flows
I be with my illy Circle understand it
I cruise now like as if I owned planet
Trying to pull it off like you getting these
Drive Infinites but you standing with your pants at your knees
You mad at me and pushing threats onto me
Still you try to bring me down but I'm higher than y'all
Steady on the gear understand the flow
Silver House and the Girl
I don't give a fuck of what you saw back in 9-5
Up in their face that they be afraid to admit it
So don't be bringing your shit round here
My advice to you is get your ass back
Only use the waste up
Be my brothers underground in the gutters
Submerged under the nonsense
Need to understand paranormal land expands
I say step to the side when young guns blazing
Everybody's got something to say
Everybody's got something to do
Something to talk about
Everybody wants to try and draw cards
They ain't got nothing to shuffle
And if they got some cards they playing with nothing but jokers
Come bitch and complain
And always got something to prove
I could care less about your attitude
And what you think about us
I stay focus cause greedy cats always chase us
Imagine I was unsigned and had more respect
I was gone for some time but still the first on your breath
You haven't done shit
I hate to see the next man rise
Crack your oven but I'm done
When ever I move eyes glued
I drop shit whether it's smooth or hard dude
Leave you all confused
When ever I move eyes glued
Now some cats tried to fuck with big dogs
You was all diet and now your hands reach for my plate
Got a long belly on the industry
Look at me with your long teeth
And more race then cars
This was meant for a few
Some was individualized
I still penetrate like I'm between two thighs
Circle enterprise is the clique
I'm the logo when exposed I come heavily
That make you all envious of us quick to bust
They pose as bad boys up in club scenes
You need to understand
Bucked to the head for all the shit they done brought up
With dark clothes and dark shades
And all around is pure clouds packing rain
He makes a mad dash to the car door
He tells Jermaine to meet him at the docks
So when the time comes for them to meet
Buys his ticket at the International pier son
You fucking with your life boy
All I need in this world is you
All I need in this world is you
I was single with plenty women
Half were plenty chicken
Now she's spending the night
Got condos in the clouds
There's nothing better than flying without trying
All I need in this world is you
All I need in this world is you
Now wishes she's taught
All I need in this world is you
All I need in this world is you
Just like my girl so I got to pursue her
All I need in this world is you
All I need in this world is you
All I need in this world is you
All I need in this world is you
All I need in this world is you
Back to where I still have always stayed
Back to where I still have always stayed
I just grew stronger.
Back to where I still have always stayed
I'll take you back into my teenage years
Man its funny how that shit just stays a trend.
More hard drives on order.
Back to where I still have always stayed
Back to where I still have always stayed
Size 13 feet with the hooks
TORONTO I'll be laid so y'all spread my name.
Back to where I still have always stayed
Back to where I still have always stayed
Back to where I still have always stayed
Well y'all can move if ya want
Picture me just a kid once again
Innocent in this world full of sin
A time took a pull pop's head took a spin
A lesson that I learned from him
Even hard to consider him friend
My moms tried to make these ends
We be poor eviction notice on the door
Will it come to an end
Pimple head kid in a Pope cardigan
Hoping the shots don't bust again
Now their mom hates me and hip hop
Can fathom the loss of your first born
Some kids got a deal with the devil sworn
Just reach for the skyline where dreams come true
Knew the cops would not be on it
Attitudes are well screwed and wanna deal with it
Now mommas crying and babies dying
Earfuls of dudes saying that who's you
Pissed off cause your teen years are through
And old dogs don't want no new rules
Picture a new rapper disrespecting Grand Master
You call up your soldiers trying to make moves again
You're setting up shop but your on claimed turf man
Just reach for the skyline where dreams come true
It's still a snap shot in time
My position is couldn't be better
For a kid in a Sears sweater
But individuals make individual moves
One overseas other VP
But it's the team so it's worth it
On tour almost got into two brawls
It's straight love y'all but I moved on
I'll see y'all when I see y'all
Just reach for the skyline where dreams come true
Grey clouds don't follow no more
No monkeys on the back
Kids with the dreams of a life sentence
And chicks with six kids from six dicks
Spending there days fucking and skylarking
From an office on the corner with a window looking out on Toronto
Sometimes its even hard to get theses words out
Now when good things come to an end
What you learn you take
Then you learn to make
Those moves in this world of cake
Now you own the place
Don't try to calculate what you can't done
It's like the world's on my shoulders
Yo I call in the squad
That comes through like Bush on Saddam
And it ain't the same
Greenhouse battleships leathered out with wood grain
And I changed the game
So you don't salt the next man's name
So grab your wings and fly
Grab your ice and whips
The boss back in town
Bitch don't lecture me bout my state and my mind
Sneak a peek through the peep whole
Give me the blunt back my man
Head down to Hill Top to meet Winnie who be clipping
At the shop that keeps me looking so fresh so clean
Can't forget Block Thirteen
Twin Rivers thinking bout life so much
The East all up in your face
Head to Johnny's on a late night stroll
My eyes stay glazed all day
And now worldwide for ten G's a plate
Her ass built like hard doe bread
Auto Feds really stand for Scarborough kids
I mark those kids with heart conditions
Could give a fuck where you came from
It's all about we and the crew
You know how these Canadians do
It's something that this blue sky does
Get your second plate for free
And later on maybe you can work your drawers
I've been sizing you girl for quite some time
Don't got a lot of money so riches I can't buy
Look like we walk like we on high rise
So chill from the scene
About every hour puff the Al Green
Not even thinking twice
Lambed out in the all black Chevy
With a pistol in position to start thumping all
Don't bounce unless you can put it together
Ladies on the back of the floor
I switched they whole game so the whole time they be following the same damn tree
With pistols in position take flight like fishing
I hear the phone ringing
I wipe the sleep from the tear ducks
The 3 means for me to go an call back immediately
And even got to say what happened
Her body language spoke a new form of rapping
Pussy so tight she grabbed my dick with it and started clapping
Would have taken the time to study it before I hit it
So I choose to peep the G right after we done did it
I'm telling you this because I'm the sweet pussy critic
Or watch your picture
I knew this trick that was similar to yours
Her body looked stolen from a Stacey Dash mold
The cactus had my brain blitzed like I'm smoking L's up in the stairs
I wonder if she'll feel me
Like she could suck the green off army fatigues
You guess you get rock more tricks than the sea
Like to mix and mingle with kings
I'm the type to leave a lasting impression
I let the ladies fell the wrath
Sorry gotta leave but when I get back
You trying to keep up with Mr. Jones
And let her know I'll be gone till June
Whip up a quick joint let it bump the monsoon
But fuck those chickens cause shocks ain't easy
Break my heart with a thing that you do
In case you misunderstood the first time round Mastermind
You dead waste La Too bad we can't see eye to eye
The way my shit keeps you open like your daughter outside
Trying to find the...
Trying to become Linguistic
Within the block stock market
I conduct every biz to the photo finish
Bomb evidence was done
History in the hands of it's writers
Gate keeper squeezing my flow
Under my door can tell me bout change
Crave thinks becoming ya weakness
First down they put up ten yards
You either gonna love me or hate me
I'm the house in the game Quick fingers
Never thought of change I'm referring on a mountain terrain
I dismiss your dissidence and doubt your intelligence
At discuss I disjoint you disc from the dispatch
Dis ain't kindergarten you don't have to go where we go
Discipline yourself before your ego disappears
Thinking about what the hell you're doing
I stand up on my stage and then I rock hard
Grab the microphone and you know I never fall
Yo I get ill no doubt
I smack the taste out your mouth and make your nose menstruate
I'm trying to show these young cats that there's more than this rap than green
Burns with flame or butane for that shit you claimed
Put a virus in your mainframe and rock spots like Sting
Turn it up a notch and let me see them speakers rock
This is for my street misses
The ones who like to creep misses
In the back seat of my Jeep misses
The ones who floss with no doe
Now people say you want to go and bring it to the streets but they realize it's too far
So I want to bring it where they are
Go back playing ball with Paul
And broke they balls to be a star
Take your whole boat off the plank
This is for my street misses
The ones who like to creep misses
In the back seat of my Jeep misses
The ones who floss with no doe
Especially when the roof is up
Plus I only touch girls in Candy Land
Never hawk chicks that could land a man
I take a girl out on a family plan
This is for my street misses
The ones who like to creep misses
In the back seat of my Jeep misses
The ones who floss with no doe
Who won't stop for nothing you want it sweeter
The type of man I am I just don't groove
This is for my street misses
The ones who like to creep misses
In the back seat of my Jeep misses
The ones who floss with no doe
I was made to move mountains
I was born to be astounding
I was grown with a good heart
The type to dive in the waters and deal with the sharks
Just a man that grew up 2 brothers in the go up
Don't mistake my niceness for weakness
I was made to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
I was made to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
The shoulders brushed off the jeans clean
Then hoped in the car with the rims that gleam
And when you feel that way your more appealing
And when your concealed yo your hiding your appeal
And when you hide your appeal your lower then equal
You use your pride as your shield
So learn from mistakes and bandage up your heal
I was made to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
I was made to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
When you feel that pressure going to your feet
And then I look into my kids eyes
And when I look in their eyes all I'm seeing is pride
And when I look in their eyes the reason why I die
I'm moving mountains thirty grand high
Until you in this position wont understand why
I was made to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
I was made to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
I was made to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
I was made to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
Ain't nobody can't bang with us
Ain't nobody can't hang with us
Check the lingo we spread through out the atmosphere
So distinctive no other style comes near
To get a glance to know who is the man with the talent
With these rhymes that are classic
Step in some make on the microphone
Burn to the next destination
Teamed with the best in the nation
School boys treat you like a fantasy
When its in town my peoples know
If you don't ask my man
They make the cash flows indeed
Ain't nobody can't bang with us
Ain't nobody can't hang with us
You heard of killer cats like this
I bring the soul to the front like my alias
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
I know you up in here to release your dealt
I'm the past to the present and the future
Ain't nobody can't bang with us
Ain't nobody can't hang with us
But if you're ready to roll with me
I'm a fine and attractive handsome young man
Girls want to talk to me
Bitch I ain't giving you no lip
See me out on the dance floor with three whores
And planning to go back to see the seashore
It's two buff strokes to shine you belly chain
Girls hold their eyes on the things I say
So call me the long dick brown skin hornet
Ladies jam on it and shake that ass
I got you under control from army to mob boy
Now I hope you don't mind if I sneak a touch
Got my own shit and I got my own game
All you ladies got to do is dance
All you ladies got to do is dance
All I want you ladies got to do is dance
All I want you ladies got to do is dance
All you ladies got to do is dance
You need to recognize
21 years of pure bullshit
It makes me wanna bang my head on the walls
And do some shit like all straight swarms in the malls
When you see red and white lights break the night skies
Reflection of a mad man in the tear
Mothers knees start to buckle up
And fall when they see their child outlined in chalk
Cold steal interrupting blood streams
That swat fights happened at Nathan's Square every year
Never seen my dad since grade 9
Maybe years before or after I don't know
But I know that time flies
So I just rely on my family
And try to be strong through the hard times
All my life I kept my eyes on the prize
But every time I reached for the prize it demised
I gotta keep my head and I gotta stay strong
I try to cover the worry and sad
And shit we never had
And g's for some lead
But people nowadays be acting unruly
I surpassed through Oz
Not coming home in bullet wounds or in some squad cars
Screwdriver's in the car
A mark of an assassin
But all the latest fashion
Custom made links and shit
Is this where fate wanted me to be
My thoughts out of control
The point of no return
I walk into the future on a narrow path
But every step I take it gives me flashbacks upon the past
Like the part I got stabbed
So fuck the picket fences
I know where I wanna be
And with the sound press on the prodigy
Parents leave a child stranded
So they grew up and to be bandits
I can't manifest Richmond Crew
Come and take a ride on the paranormal side
Come and take a ride on the paranormal side
Forever seeing things you can't see
To throw a show an clock the reds and the browns
Peace to Julie Black who lives out in North York
You got no credentials or potential to step into the realm of the sexual
Now first things first
Bring it to your face brother or to your chest
Got you in my grips like vice
And I'm known to keep a hot spot
Flows like blood clots
From a to z including p's and q's
Like Parker Lewis can't lose
Your lacking a smacking
Stop acting like you're shifty
This lyrical hit can dis the
And make a grown woman miss me
Ha ha ha I laugh when I kick ass
Sometimes I wear my contacts sometimes I wear my glass
And tone dark skin body shape slim fast
Sit down and wonder how a brother like I
Can stick out and penetrate like I'm between two thighs
Smiling on people think they rule like Castro
They run around the board but they never pass go
Now this be the fifth verse different from the first
Use me innovate your thirst
I'm bright like the sun with the flavor ready to burst
I run with two in this rap game
This bomb shock heavy loading explosion
You know you like being spoiled
The same climax of elevation
Yeah check out my stats
I throw more bombs than quarterbacks
Only facts freestyle on a daily is my aerobics
No impaired vision clear focus
Stick to your tricks and porno flicks
It's like cocky style 1-2-3
We roll by the trio east coast
One day for now we chill and pave the way
Memories that make me happy
Yeah reminisce like Mary J
It's all that real love in my blood
That keep my lyrics tight like my butt and my nuts
I'm all eternal like your guts
Oh let me get my groove on now
Burn the word tomorrow
Watch the way I catch wreck
Now who I be is someone who you can't see
Forget the nonsense it's all about shocks
Got some ladies that'll go downtown so fellas hush it
They either hate it or then ya love it
Some girls say they don't do it
Come and take a ride on the paranormal side
Come on rock the spot
Come and take a ride on the circle that's inside
What does it take to make it
What does it take to make it
My style will lock you down and get your brain stimulated
Decapitating people while my pen orchestrated
Mad flavor on the paper
And Ill Behavior be favoring some sky scrapers
I be looking over sides like snipers
When my shots ring to bust up a cipher
And lighters be flicking
Causing mad casualties
And made your doves cry
So people check my slang
The Borough Side Representative's who I be
For all your propaganda
Without knowing the ramifications
Conceited for the fact that all these people around town with
Blown heads got depleted
What does it take to make it
What does it take to make it
Forget the nonsense that ain't real
I don't talk about no guns because guns I do not carry
They pass like breeze
Or maybe leave like trees
Some rappers wonder how I do it
But I still come back
They try to be on the wrong side of the tracks
But got licked by the train
What does it take to make it
What does it take to make it
What does it take to make it
They got me in the jail that I copped
All you know it all looked good
I paint it if the shit look live
The Butcher... Lex Leonardo...
Take it one day at a time
Combine all the thoughts from the mind
See through y'all like a Australian hundred
So y'all can just party ya way out
So when it comes time for me to put it out
I get my point off what I'm about
To be the best weapon on earth
If I die my lyrics are legible
Educate all the people amongst me
My whole state asks me to stand on my shoulders
I fuck with hos from videos not then again I read
Respect ya for not me I be superficial
My whole state asks me to stand on my shoulders
I fuck with hos from videos not then again I read
Respect ya for not me I be superficial
I write rhymes on backpedals of dusted cars
Trust these bars to get high enough to touch the stars
My dreams far to big for a box
And got the latest devices on my head
It's all here as far as this rap shit
Set my watch to crisis
Twice as much you wanted first is what you get
This the whole enchilada
Go harder to the paint of stained glass artists
This battle see what the big apple think
Kitty cats be jocking when they catch me in the hallways rocking
Just when you thought you had all forgotten
Cooler than water rice from Rita's
Your daughters fight to meet us
Folks notice me both locally and oversees
Vocally ain't nobody approaching me
You know the three Mountain Bros and we flow with ease
When I school kids I'm cool and ruthless
That like huge tits dipped in Cool Whip
If I had a dime for every time a lady caught feelings
Your chance of beating me it's really close to nothing
My custody for private investigation
You cry in lust to see the sky kid to test your patience
And took the devil's place and get strange
We on a rise to meet all challengers
Who in the world want war
With this thorough Philly boar
Underground like the earth's core
I took the elevator up to the first floor
I'm an MC you don't wanna have a problem with
Spitting vomit that's thicker than mucous
Paint oil pictures of the future clearer than George Lucas
To the day that we all become human computers
The flow that I spits is not to be confused with
Commercial radio rap put out for your amusement
With this thorough Philly boar
So much vital information you could find in each verse
Before I die I bury my rhymes beneath the dirt
Catch me in the Library of Congress doing research
Q dimensions stay coming off
Like female porno star's panties and bras
I'm two thousand and two tons of lyrical art
That'll crush your heart and discourage your courage
We the current that circles through the underground circuit
Fill the streets full with serpents that feel life is worthless
Drown in the depths of the sounds of these verses
I'm down with Chops from Philly
Brought back a couple platinum plaques on the plane
Brought back and sold you to change the game
The lyrics in my heart I can't restrain they real
I swear to God I wish I had a dollar bill
You are watching a master at work
Take notes how I stack these bank notes
Take notes how I get their throat wet as rain coats
So they ain't never gonna be better than me I'm too nice
Mine top 10 potential before it leave my lip
My shit stay banging like that clip on my hip
That bastard really not a factor
None before and won't be none after
You better get your henchmen and try to get that lynching charge
And take some off you head like a bad shave
They don't need to better they need to QUIT
I used to take beats and break beats
My bass shake seats to the point it make freaks
Wanna take me and make me straight beat
I can talk about my jewelry and my two cars
That bastard really not a factor
None before and won't be none after
You gone scream like you seen a bad dream
Or you can be the groupie let me autograph that booty
You bought me some Gucci but I don't really wear it
So gone get it wet DRIP DROP
So I can take my pistol out the holster
I wanna see you next to me
Can you get my dick harder than the SAT
You feel a tingle down yo spine as I work my way down
My way or your way then I eat it like some gourmet
I like to play wit you make it so you can't resist
This why every kiss seem like the first kiss
Momma must have gave it all to the daughter
From the second that I call her to I pull up
And if sex was a major I'd have a degree
Every grind ain't a slow grind
Understand this here daddy
Sometimes you really gotta handle your bis
This what I get in my dreams sometimes
That you can't see me
Ain't what you thought you saw
People I used to know
But everywhere that I go
Who got people they know
Down South Cartel baby
I'll be all around the block
Come on in and make some room
We have a special guest tonight
After half a million downloads
Countless sold out shows
Shovel in hand I dug from the underground
They used to run they mouth
First photo shoot was my ultrasound
Always caught disturbing the peace
Cause my flow is sharper than Excalibur
Gladiator in the flesh
Swinging for your fucking neck
Slicing up these beats
While you bitches can even cut a check
Werewolf with a full moon in the dark
Tear a fucking human apart
But my music made a westward expansion something like Lewis and Clark
Climbing up the musical charts
That's like Bullseye from Daredevil losing at darts
I'm just a crazy motherfucker
I'm lyrically inclined
Put my spirit in my rhymes
You can hear it in my lines
That's just how the cookie crumbles
Mark my teachers words
They told me that I should be mature
But now that my pockets beefed up
To be on my level your gonna need a step stool
Always been a troublemaker gotta break rules
Full bred pit with a little Maltese
I'm just doing what I do
Murder any beat I put my mind too
Thought you knew that's what I do
Through and through that's what I do
L ride around town and be back for lunch
Got a full plate of beats and some Captain Crunch
Life's short so you know I gotta live it up
I'm just doing what I do
Murder any beat I put my mind too
Thought you knew that's what I do
Through and through that's what I do
Double tap X with a shot to the brain
And fatality anybody who shits on my name
Fully transform bout to take over the game soon
I'm just doing what I do
Murder any beat I put my mind too
Thought you knew that's what I do
Through and through that's what I do
Up at the stadium where the lights lime
Round trip on a magical school bus
Put in the groundwork now it's time to cash in
I don't know about you but I know one thing
I ain't gonna wait around here to make it
Anybody with a dream got to feel the same
And disappear into the skyline
And they ain't ready for the shit that I'm about to do
I don't know about you but I know one thing
I ain't gonna wait around here to make it
Anybody with a dream got to feel the same
And disappear into the skyline
If you got a dream you should follow it
As a kid no one could figure me out
Live my life to a whole new beat
But all I see is the skyline ahead of me
I don't know about you but I know one thing
I ain't gonna wait around here to make it
Anybody with a dream got to feel the same
You see I'm here to save the day with this music
For Sale signs go up soon as I show up
Making history from the second they flip the lights on
I made it off being business savvy and street smart
I'm just playing what I'm dealt
Shit it's been a long road but I got a lot under my belt
So I know I'm gonna make it in the long haul
So I'm gonna reach up for the stars and I'll pray for the best
And that's how it's gonna be until the day of my death. Word
Just play and tune into this music
Have no fear I'll save the day with this music
Say hello to the new guy in town
Then go ahead and spit that semen on a petri dish
With this fire off the top like Sweet Tooth in Twisted Metal
I respect your damn opinion if you don't like my music
Just play and tune into this music
Have no fear I'll save the day with this music
Say hello to the new guy in town
Not even Gatorade replenishes electrolytes
And half these rapper idiots aren't even literate
Fire in my eyes and a hunger for success
Just play and tune into this music
Have no fear I'll save the day with this music
Say hello to the new guy in town
Get these letters in my brain and cause a chemical reaction
With enough force to level a continent
Go bananas like Johnny Drama and Andrew Dice Clay
Say good night to the bad guy
I'll be here until they bury me and that's why
They know to run when they see me
I'll be here until they bury me and that's why
They no to run when they see me
You can catch me where the wild things be at
With the physical strength of a Neanderthal
I been the hottest dude under the sun
So bow down to me or get eaten like sushi
Say good night to the bad guy
I'll be here until they bury me and that's why
They know to run when they see me
I'll be here until they bury me and that's why
They no to run when they see me
So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am
So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am
So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am
So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am
I'm through the roof like St. Nicholas
But I don't got no Christmas gifts I'm only here to spit this shit
I'm out in the mysterious beyond
Tatted on my ribs so CT with it
Skinny as a motherfucker still I rep the Huskies
I'm through the roof now bitch no one's above me
So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am
So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am
So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am
So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am
Got my light saber in hand
That's how I've always gotta be
So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am
So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am
So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am
So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am
That I can't get no higher than I am
That I can't get no higher than I am
That I can't get no higher than I am
That I can't get no higher than I am
I can't get no higher than I am
Carry so much tree that my pockets turn green
Cleaner than the cut on school picture day
They can't even see me with a telescope
So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am
So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am
So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am
So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am
That I can't get no higher than I am
That I can't get no higher than I am
That I can't get no higher than I am
With the speakers to the maximum baby just let it bounce
Let it be said a bit with the excellent rhetoric
I'm such an animal they kicked me off of Noah's Ark
With the speakers to the maximum baby just let it bounce
Started off small now I do it for the masses
Now these new college kids think that they can match it
Being modest isn't in a single molecule
With the speakers to the maximum baby just let it bounce
I'm a beast why would I compete with these chumps
Bad to the bone you can check my damn skeleton
Designed to just be a menace
Let me pop a pill and witness me defy the laws of physics
Tell Newton I really did it
No losing so let me get it
Maneuvering with the quickness
I'm the reason that my local pharmacy is still in business
Now they see me as more than just a gimmick with tattoos
I think I got another doctor's appointment to pencil in
Buckled in on whatever shuttle they try to land me in
Unable to see straightly wherever the E takes me
Even if the doctor says I'll get a hole in my brain
A drug induced animal posted up with the lights low
And find my mark like Magellan with more lines than Corey Feldman
Take me home now bitch
Take me home now bitch
The world was falling on me when my back was in a jam
My best friends are not strangers
These are the motherfuckers I hang with
We speak the same language
I'm the sameness and fuck being famous
Fame dreams are for groupies
What I mean is I'm truly off the hook
Take me home now bitch
Take me home now bitch
I kill it quickly and always keeping the realest with me
Keep your chick with me as long as she give dome
The infiltration of the game
Born from a central hatred of fame
A pencil shaking with pain
An injured stake in the claim from the wrath I became
My whole career's a robbery that they could never scoop me from
Take me home now bitch
Take me home now bitch
I started in the game on the grind and I still am
All of it off a sweat on my back without a deal man
Gotta stay focused in the land of opportunity
Prepared for any twist and turn that anybody threw at me
Grew to be a beast learned it all up in the cypher
I grew up decapitating anybody who battled me
On the go hard diet I burn calories
I've lost my marbles somebody should straight jacket me
Latch it and throw the key in the deepest part of the blackest sea
And still I'll make it back and make every hater a casualty
And shouts to everyone who supported me on my path to be
Successful in one way or an other cause grammatically
They know no one could fuck with my metaphorical masterpiece
The good die young someone show me where the casket be
I keep on moving forward
With my head held high
I do this shit forever or at least until I die
Ain't no use in stopping
I got nothing left to hide
I do this shit forever
You couldn't stop me if you tried
Me with a microphone is like Bob Ross with a paint brush
I don't need a cheap shot to leave your raps laid up
I keep on moving forward
With my head held high
I do this shit forever or at least until I die
Ain't no use in stopping
I got nothing left to hide
I do this shit forever
You couldn't stop me if you tried
I keep on moving forward
With my head held high
I do this shit forever or at least until I die
Ain't no use in stopping
I got nothing left to hide
I do this shit forever
The bars are on me all night
If they wanna go bar for bar we can do it on sight
Everyone got an opinion but they won't step up
Can do a fucking handstand still got no leg up
And half the game be softer than what Ben and Jerry are making
I'm a transcendentalist with literary arrangements
Vocabulary is like a dictionary replacement
But they only talking money and they last time I was checking
And convoluted messages is really what you're messing with
Where's the dope shit what happened to that
Had this devil on my shoulder during catechism
Staying high from the purple and the hash I'm hitting
Scrubbing all the blood out the trunk of the Grand Cherokee
In need of therapy but the doctor's scared of me
The reason women say that chivalry's dead
Staying blunted with a fifth to the head
In a hatchback running people over till your body parts are stuck in my motor
And now I know that anyone that stomps at me will tremble in my hands
Comfortably stand right where I'm at
About to rise to be a mother fucking titan of rap
Give them pieces of my soul and put my life in a track
In the game where people quick to put that knife in your back
Gotta teach yourself to move like a wolf or get preyed on
Fuck blowing up the real challenge is to stay on
You must be fucking stupid if you take on
Let it be said a bit with the excellent rhetoric
It's that evil rap nemesis second coming of Hendrix
Open your eyes and see the headlights running over you driving
Over and over and over it on the road that I'm riding
Of everything your parents told you not to be probably
Taking shots out the bottle and now Alcoholics Anonymous
Practicing karate kicks on people back in the audience
Let it be said a bit with the excellent rhetoric
And you mother fuckers better get the cameras ready for action
Shit is bound to cause a deadly reaction
Jimmy Hoffa the fucking beat and leave them in landfills
You can feel it in your cavity filling
I'm just trying to get some money till it stack to the ceiling
With all these motherfucking tracks that I'm killing
Then we cook them up until I toss them in my tummy and my brain is dysfunctional
Let it be said a bit with the excellent rhetoric
Eyes low from the weed we roll and I'm in my zone
And we came to get down right
Eyes low from the weed we roll and I'm in my zone
And we came to get down right
Eyes low from the weed we roll and I'm in my zone
And we came to get down right
Eyes low from the weed we roll and I'm in my zone
And we came to get down right
The dude who fucked your girl last Summer
And I ain't even smash with a rubber
So if your kid look like me
Don't even ask motherfucker
With a bottle in your hand
And a blunt to the head
But I think the doctor gave me something else instead
Real life Billy Madison
Until I see those fucking lights on the cop car
Sloppy drunk in that VIP
Ever since I had a fake ID
You could be just like me
I'm so high that I'm reading shit backwards
The next shot of Jack in front of me looking risky
And I'm feeling like I'll never go to sleep
With all this shit that's in my system
I'll be up for a week
With a cup of vodka and some ice cubes
I be living in the left lane
I be living in the left lane
I be living in the left lane
I be living in the left lane
When you be living in the left lane
Fucking monster call me Frankenstein and Dracula combined
I be living in the left lane
I be living in the left lane
I be living in the left lane
I be living in the left lane
When you be living in the left lane
But if they be coming at me bro
I be living in the left lane
I be living in the left lane
I be living in the left lane
I be living in the left lane
Only my booking agent know where I'm about to go
With a pretty young thing and an ounce to roll
In a different city every night like I was on the run
But I made it back to shore and I'm next on deck
Always got a little sexy brunette on text
Always been the under dog call me Fido
Either that or I'm going to go down swinging
Shout to Sap always killing a track
And until I get a Grammy I'll be doing just dandy
The black sheep's now the bread winner of the family
I only think about it when I'm looking back
To the kid I used to be writing lyrics during class
Back when I had nothing but ambition and a dream
And a composition notebook full of rhyme schemes
And gave it everything while I was working on my come up
And now I came up and baby I won't stop till I'm done
All these years of hard work are finally paying off
There's really only one direction to go now
Used to show up to the spot and they would stop me at the door
Now my name is hot so they be acting like they know
And they leading my right through those velvet ropes
And my fans be getting them tickets quicker than pissing in public in Times Square
And I light it up and I breathe it and my blunt be full of that four leaf
You're a disappointment and blame everybody else that you never got where you hoped to be
Used to show up to the spot and they would stop me at the door
Now my name is hot so they be acting like they know
And they leading my right through those velvet ropes
Hanging out my window like
But my plates are good and I'm fucking dry
Then head back to my parents house and get drunk until I run out of beer
Used to show up to the spot and they would stop me at the door
Now my name is hot so they be acting like they know
And they leading my right through those velvet ropes
Living life up on the stage and it's like I'm on display
And the fans coming through when they know every word to the songs that I fucking play
Bang the speakers out plus tears are leaking out
And now they ain't ready for this crazy white boy
Running through the rap game like Donkey Kong
I'm homegrown and I grew the roots and it's about damn time that I flew the coop
So mother fucker let me show you what this dude could do
Going through the roof and I'm gonna hold my own
Got my foot up on the pedal till the sun goes down
I just hop up in the driver's seat and
Sitting first class on a flight and I still got fight
And set the world on fire when I give it a light
You never heard of one like this in your life because I go so hard
Is back to the smack the world off it's axis
So I'm telling you all the ups and downs so you can see the world I'm in
Looking through my eyelids
Got my foot up on the pedal till the sun goes down
I just hop up in the driver's seat and
Even harder for me not to wear my heart on my sleeve
It's hard to describe the feeling when somebody telling me that my music got them through when they were feeling like giving up
Player wishing to sleeping like 20 times in a row
Look at my dressing room
1,000 miles away they want an autograph
He said he like my deep records and my party tracks
I scribble things across the bottom half
Got my foot up on the pedal till the sun goes down
I just hop up in the driver's seat and
Cannonballed off the deep end and swam further out
Put one in the air like Super Smash pulling Kirby out
And get fucking intense like Native American sex
That's why I'm still in Connecticut where my chariot rest
Watched too many people run with my formula and get famous
Put my life up on the line for the glory that I've been chasing
And cut the snakes out like Medusa up at Super Cuts
Never once did I suggest that you should try it
I remember being lost and hopeless in my parent's attic
And the weight of carrying the fucking state up on my shoulders
The jealous ones developing resentment for the crew
Without knowing what I've been through
So come and step in these shoes
Independent and continually making fans
And they hopping right on to the band wagon
With this puff the magic dragon stuffed into a gram bag and
Only way to get me to shut my mouth is to murder me
Go balls to the wall like I'm fucking y'all through a glory hole
I'm still underrated and overlooked
But fuck it yo I feel terrific
We've already made it further than anybody predicted
Tapes on tapes with a handful of crazy tours
Pour up a full cup and chug it down
I can do this every single time I come around
I'm just trying to do some shit that makes my mother proud
And they said I could make a million dollars if I dumbed it down
Thursday to Wednesday I be so crazy
It's not what I try for but it's my business
I couldn't lose my mind more
Jumping out the window on the 9th floor
Now they're saying they gotta send me to the psych ward
That be like seeing Drake and Rampage in a cage match
And I've been put up on this planet to ramble and raise havoc
With a bottle and an eighth a day habit
Cold as the toes of a penguin
Feet up on the throne that I've settled in
Running off of adrenaline and unprescribed medicine
So it's time you met the man behind the curtain
I'm killing this game since it ain't love us
Yeah I'm about to set if off
Yeah I'm about to set if off
Yeah I'm about to set if off
Yeah I'm about to set if off
Never graduated from school but I made it this cool
Right to the top like I'm defying gravitational pull
But still rolling with my dogs when I'm homeward bound
When I see Sap at the back of the weed spot
Then we turn it up so loud that the back of your seat rocks
From the very second that the beat drops
They be sweating when I be walking through the door
I'm about to set it off
Stay writing while rhyming and stage diving
I been patiently waiting but learned that it takes time
And now I got the same look in my eye as a caged lion
Since I used to battle cats for they lunch money
They be sweating when I be walking through the door
I'm about to set it off
Yeah I'm about to set if off
Yeah I'm about to set if off
Yeah I'm about to set if off
Burning more things than calories
I'm about to open an abortion clinic right next to your local church
Jerking off until my motherfucking shoulder hurts
Shit I'm pretty sure she's dead but you can check yourself
While I run her wallet and spend all the money at Taco Bell
Anyone this deranged should surely be locked in jail
But busted while I was half inside her
Then I woke up in the morning and had a reminder
That she's getting plan B for breakfast with an apple cider
I don't need a reason
I'm creeping up like sex offenders with binoculars on a beach in bikini season
Stomp you to death then throw my Nike's back on the shoe rack
Somebody told me orange is the new black
So I scrub my white T till it turns the color copper
And use some Tide detergent and throw it up in the washer
Drinking till I'm buzzing like my phone's on vibrate
Taking another shot just to clear my mind state
So I'd like to welcome you to Project X
All you need is that 5 dollars for a cup and you can party till the sun comes up
And I don't wanna push my luck
I've been trained to be a weekend warrior
There is no other option
Even if the memories we make are all forgotten
I'll be sipping my concoction
And mature at my own pace
Cause for years I've been living this exact same way
Reach into my back pocket and pull a bag out
Then finally the herb come around
Blunt ride back and burn the fuck down
Have some fun with it yo
C Web in the booth and I speak it real
Got another beat to kill
And I be roasting motherfuckers
Rest In Peace Patrice O'Neil
Roll up another blunt
Now I'm off in another dimension
In need of an intervention
Cause these drugs are too fucking expensive
But I'm feeling terrific dude
Banging these broads with no fucking protection
I wasn't paying any fucking attention
Living it like a pirate man
Always got me a barrel of booze
Puffing until I can barely move
Hipping and hopping and rambling shit
Cause these pills I've been popping have got me confused
I'm not the one you want a problem with
Swear I'm ready for whatever standing in front of my mirror
Supporting my confidence
The problem is we won't acknowledge it
Now I'm playing like a kid on the black top
Got the juice with a flat top
I guarantee that the crowd go crazy
Traveling and taking shots
I need a nasty girl to taste the cock
Somebody pass the god damn liquor
Roll one up in that Swisher Sweet
Flowing double time when I freak the beat
Holding up mine when I hit the street
Killing the spot from the moment
Getting mine while the price high
Burn it down till it's hard to see
I'm a keep my brim low low low low low low low low
So I'm a keep my brim low
I got a dutch rolled full of that greenery
Joint papers up in the wallet I always have one
My veins run green from all this weed
I'm so damn high I can barely even see
Now I got my energy and I'm still blasted
Marijuana makes life so fantastic
Until you take that last brain cell and I go crazy
Burn it down till it's hard to see
I'm a keep my brim low low low low low low low low
So I'm a keep my brim low
I'm a keep my brim low
I'm a keep my brim low
Burn it down till it's hard to see
I'm a keep my brim low low low low low low low low
Making money off of shows but can't even make a payment on a new whip
But the fans keep me motivated I know I can do this
But how much would it hurt to show a little love back
I been chilling in the basement underground
It's bullshit I've been doing this my whole life
They he's good but he's no slim shady
In my humble opinion Marshall's the best that's ever lived
So many damn shows I'm basically on tour
You hear that it's rap
And here are the facts
I grind harder than most of these dudes do
Poseidon with the flow
So close I can taste it
Haters smoke a blunt by yourself and just face it.
When it feels like the sky is falling
And the world is crumbling down
Listen deep inside your body for that
Boom clap clap boom clap clap boom clap sound
That's what we do when the king in the building
That's how we do when the caps start peeling
That's how we do when the I'm smoking on my gram yeah
Tell me what you mother fuckers really wanna do
Wanna run around the track while I run around it too
Run run run like me hit that rip that
Let me put in the pipe let me pack it in the bowl
Let me run run run run run run run
Like a motor bike racer running this show
I'll never really get upset all the way to the point
Where I feel like these no holding back now
Try to get a good outlet try to reroute
All the thoughts that's are weighing me down now
All it seems I need is a big bag of weed
And a couple shots of lets say crown
Few dope beats and I'm taking to jeep to a mt top out of town
So I don't blow my top off and explode
For me to come back in piece body whole
I now that you know or at least I know that you relate
Put your song on your headphones and know that your not alone
When it feels like the sky is falling and the world is crumbling down
Listen deep inside your body clap clap clap clap clap that
Everybody it's time clap that clap that clap that sound
Everybody it's time clap that clap that clap that sound
Zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom away zoom zoom
Web hit them with that boom clap sound
Need apple juice cause everybody on the track
Continents that made up Pangaea
A medical from a dispensary in Los Angeles
Can't handle this amateurs get devoured in
Got no manners kid Wayne and Garth in the building
So lifted off the ground that they think we're extraterrestrials
Everybody in the area spark it up so they lose there minds
And I rep for the 2 to the 0 to the 3
Never hold back with the words I spew
Through my mouth aimed right at you
Through and through I'm that
You don't wanna try that
Can't see me like ya own eyelash
Kill the track with the excellent words
Always drop the hottest
Higher than a rocket orbiting the rings of Jupiter
I'm the psychopathic illegitimate son of Lucifer
Kill anything that I go and do
Come at me once and your dead
In the afterlife you'll be 0 and 2
It's fantasy to imagine me in a sober mood
Winnings what I chose to do
And I did and now it's game over dude
I'm the next white boy just to let you know
I grab a hold of the beat and I never let it go
Then say that I don't do drugs
Never been a day that I gave a fuck
So shut your mouth and tape it up
I've lost my mind I'm surprised I still have my head attached
I get my razor in hand and you know I shred a track
I'm rap... back to attack the store kill my mom's bedroom
... Spent in... baby everything I said...
First agree murder beats with the best skill
I just try to hate but can't compete...
... Kid... scratching.
I kill a bee mother fucker better grab a medic
From the past to present I get attacked revenges to... like a... crack dependence
Try to get my money and... and spend it
And take my competition... just like a...
Never smart to play with me
The flow is never rated G.
My style is indescribable
So nobody can label me.
Then I'm prepared for war.
So you know I'm down to carry a sword.
So my competitors stare at the score.
But I spit that heat.
And I stomp that beat.
Don't even know if you want that beef.
I get loose like the crotch of my jeans.
So complex when I rap.
Can't even tell what a lot of it means.
By any possible means.
With that audio crack rock
So get ready for the show
Baby gather your friends.
It's that foul mouth white boy
Everybody that I can.
Never air to my words.
And I rep it for sure.
Anybody and everybody can tell
The best in the burbs.
But I'll have a pack of animals
Stampeding through your lobby.
Play the roll of Tommy.
Than complicated origami.
I'm the opposite of Gandhi.
I'm sending you back.
You'll be lucky if you leave
With your head attached.
When I attack the nervous system
With these venomous tracks.
It evolved to something new.
And bring out the damn tanks.
So get ready for the show
Baby gather your friends.
It's that foul mouth white boy
Everybody that I can.
Never air to my words.
Anybody and everybody can tell
The best in the burbs.
Which ever way the wind blows
With these glasses that can shelter my eyes
From the life I live yo
Now I'm caught between both Jekyll and Hyde
Which ever way the wind blows
With the fucking world watching every movement through the windows
It's a cold world and it predicts snow
Thinking back to when I started as a kid yo
Dreaming that one day making music be what I did for work
Of the camera every fucking where that it follows me
Now I'm stuck in the middle
Which ever way the wind blows
With these glasses that can shelter my eyes
From the life I live yo
Now I'm caught between both Jekyll and Hyde
Ever way the wind blows
With these glasses that can shelter my eyes
From the life I live yo
Now I'm caught between both Jekyll and Hyde
Till my bank statement reads 27 million
They said I couldn't do it so you know I gotta get it done
I hit the fork in the road and took a detour
Blow minds when they heard the rap
Make bass lines sizzle when I burn a track
Yo I'm nice better learn the facts
On the day before thanksgiving yeah I drop a lot
Of shit stealthy in the game like an ocelot
I'm a train passenger all I need is a track
The best and I just don't stop... an animal
My manager found me up at Pet Supplies Plus
Without expending any energy effortlessly
And a hometown throne in the 203
They better tuck and roll
So I'll wear a rubber bro
If I have a kid I'll get disowned by my mother yo
On another note nobody can step to me
I think I may have told you already but with my memory
It's hard to remember anything after all the ecstasy
But still they can't touch me like I got a case of Leprosy
Roll a J and take one to the head John Kennedy
Even at 45 with a beer gut
Untamed understand the flows
HBO flow with a Band of Bros
And a chick with an ass fatter then Amber Rose
Another weed song from me
So high flying through space with Jimmy Neutron
You would think I had a mother fucking pot prescription
Just break it up and smoke that la la la la la
Now twist it up and smoke that la la la la la
Now light it up and smoke that la la la la la
The way this weed hit your chest should invest in Kevlar
Everyday I got the best bars
In my own entourage smoking like Turtle
But that's just how I do
And then we stay around more trees than Fern Gully
I rip like a beast when I hit the beats
Till we start to see shit like Joan of Arc
That's why you can't see me like a poltergeist
We all get to that point in our life
Shit really hits the fan
And everything seems like it sucks
Everything happened for a reason
But once you make the choice you're forced to live with it
Some people never get it till they live it
And then when the live it it's not a chance that they ever could forget it
You wish you could switch you weight on that lawyer visit
The way I have been living my life just wouldn't cut it
Head always in the clouds
And surely I figured out thoroughly that that was only hurting me
Now I need a purposely to get my life back on track
And leave some things in the past
Its as simple as that
Some people say that I'm not worth it
I make mistakes but no body's perfect
I guess ill give it a try
I got one last chance
To get myself together
Can't lose no more time
And I try to remember who I used to be
I got one last chance to get myself together
Sometime you need to realize
You got one last chance when the outcome of your life
Rest within the judges hands
And I'll never understand how one man with a gavel
Can decide if you future is worth being unraveled
And send you right down shits
For as long as the dude sees fit
You could find yourself in prison over one wrong decision
It's difficult to get this shit out of your mind
Wish you could just press rewind go back in time
But I've accepted that I need to find the bright side
Cause off to the dark is the only thing inside
I'll find that silver lining
One set back wont stop me
I'm still here breathing
Believing that even this shit happened for a reason
Some people say that I'm not worth it
I make mistakes but no body's perfect
I guess ill give it a try
I got one last chance
To get myself together
I can't lose no more time
And I try to remember who I used to be
I got one last chance to get myself together
Ooh and I don't wanna be misunderstood
I got to take this chance and make it into something good
Some people say that I'm not worth it
I make mistakes but no body's perfect
I guess I'll give it a try
Can't lose no more time
And I try to remember who I used to be
I got one last chance to get myself together
I got one last chance
You can always bounce back
This is my inner struggle
Fighting through the game with every hit they cue the thunder
Feet don't fail me now
Would you believe what I've been through
Sometimes I wonder what I get into
The mind plays tricks on a young artist
Like why they going the furthest but I'm working the hardest
Bombarded with comments by fans
Write songs to find my way through the darkness
I promise you don't want to start shit
Looking like I barely started but these rhymes ready for harvest
Office job wasn't meant for me
I'm meant to be on stage and the kids will scream
Lyrics don't let me get to sleep
I partner and forget what I did achieve
History repeats itself
And I'll repeat myself
Until the day they fucking get it
Not to mention I ain't never had a plan B
A lot of goals but it's feeling like I can't reach
Can't speak on a lot of things
I'm hoping that they all work out
I was feeling burnt out
Now I'm feeling like it's go time
I'll never be trapped in a box
This is my inner struggle
Fighting through the game with every hit they cue the thunder
Feet don't fail me now
Would you believe what I've been through
Sometimes I wonder what I get into
Felt suicidal like I want a vein to be split
This the third job I done lost
I ran out of reasons for breathing
Can't let all the bullshit defeat him
My kid can't eat those raps
I need a moment like Kodak
If I had a time machine I'd go back
Girl think I'm out here fucking these whores
I'm out here grinding
I've done been through enough stress
It's a must that I progress
The other day I was hopeless
Chasing my dream till I catch it
This is my inner struggle
Fighting through the game with every hit they cue the thunder
Feet don't fail me now
Would you believe what I've been through
Sometimes I wonder what I get into
Give a fuck what I can or I can't say
Cause my end game looking so bright
That these people got to cover the microphone up with a damn lamp shade
Better learn not to take it personal
Back up before I murder you
Not with a gun though
I'm a god damn monster
Coming out when the sun's low
I've been out here grinding
No cosign but I kept on climbing
Had enough of never having my cash up
Now I got the momentum of 20 mack trucks
And it's finally getting recognized and that feels
Every step I just kept shit real
And really what more can you ask
Even if I'm not your musical preference
You gotta respect that
So just watch me as I live my dream
Pull up a seat and relax
Enjoy the show and watch me go
Yeah anytime I step I blaze it thoroughly
No one seeing me I need corrective laser surgery
Hotter then the summer bitch you know I got it covered son
Get it done when I get up on a beat and I tear it up
Cause all I got in this world is my word and a pair of nuts
With lyrics sharper then the claws retracted in a leopards paw
This rapping is a sport to me
Break it down importantly
Whiter then a kilo bitch I'm bringing Boston George with me
Rambling answering the hate and spitting gorgeously
And yes I got the force with me
Torture be have them all asking where the chorus be
Bitch I'm good money and nobody affording me
I got my competition saying our fathers
And every fucking hater running scared like Paul walker
I don't fire deadly shots
Never with a semi cocked
Just light up heavy pot and spit venom call me eddy Brock
So steadily I'll get to the top
Clever as ever so watch the bass and treble will not
So fucking loud it's like getting hit in the head with a rock
When I spit I'm a rap rebel
With my size 10 Jordan on the fucking gas pedal
Ain't nobody messing with the rhythm I flow
Then I roll it up and hit it till that's ash
Then my drug dealer gonna get a call back back
On a track accurate that's the reason I'm so relaxed when I rap
Cause the facts are the facts and the fact of it is
Dog I'm ripping more beats
Carrying the game just like a baby in the storks beak
I'm doctor robotic it with knuckles in my pocket
Toxic so fucking dirty you should wash it
Spitting it with flavor
Ripping wisdom on the paper
Bitch I get the block popping
Just like tiger was my neighbor
Precision like a laser no one playing with this
I just throw together words and I rip shit ill
Spit with skills bitch this real
Brain slow down on proscription pills
Need a deal damn straight make the fucking land shake
Ari go looking for me since he seen the fan base
All you do is Google me and haters keep they mouth shut
Now what like a deer hunter all about bucks
If your trying to burn with me you'll need at least an ounce plus
Its in my nature I guess
I'm fucking meant for this
Ain't no type of censorship equipped for all my sentences
The booth is like my octagon you don't wanna enter this
I'm Anderson silver so step in here your getting leveled quick
Popping stars and I'll be raving until I'm sober
I'm not afraid of shit I'm as brave as the little toaster
Cocaine and some baking soda
I'm crack next up to bat
Griffy junior to these losers
No one's fucking with the stats
Pupils fat and got a bag of molly in the pocket
It but spit so fucking flawless they can't help it but to jock
The big new thing read about me in the comics
Under high and low its rhyme and potent lyrics better watch it
Now I'm back and I rip it up and spit it so nice
Ain't nobody messing with a poltergeist
So far ahead that I'm out of site
Hat I'm down to fight
There never been a night where my pen don't write
There never been a night that I don't rap nice
When I'm on the right weed and rolled up tight
Who could ever mess with him
The medicine you get it then
Show them I'm never settling
Fucking paper shredder em
You wanna step your chances are looking extra slim
Grinding every day reaching the top
And I'm only a step away you don't believe me watch
There's nobody left to help you
Hop in the whip... and roll.
Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me
Got my mind on my money but I still don't have a stack.
And when I get my turn I swear to God that it's a wrap
Still like a kid but I'm newly 22 though
They know me as the chew from CT to Pluto
But I always had it in me I just needed to apply myself
And rap's all I've ever loved besides myself.
Then you'd be cocky too.
Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me
Got my mind on my money but I still don't have a stack.
And when I get my turn I swear to God that it's a wrap
And though you grow up you still hang on to the past
Being young was a blast and you clean up your act
That's what I did and shit I'm all right
Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me
Got my mind on my money but I still don't have a stack.
And when I get my turn I swear to God that it's a wrap
Soon enough I'm in a two door drop
So I dare you to go and find a dude more hot
Of the skinny white boy with a scratchy throat
I got an army of ninjas across the US
Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me
Got my mind on my money but I still don't have a stack.
And when I get my turn I swear to God that it's a wrap
I'm sure I'll settle down one day.
I'm just trying to have a good time.
Living in the moment and what not.
It's seems like every week
I get some girlie's number
Always looking for somewhere to put a bone.
Bitches looking like Sloane.
I just really want to see them panties
Your girlfriend sweats me.
Right after she's left me.
And I'll be it to my death.
So if you at the play
And then she make me say...
Where it ought to be.
All I gotta do is spit game
Just don't expect my phone to answer
When you're calling me.
Check my paternity test.
And burning the best.
While you kiss on my neck.
Just give her the chance.
While I'm trying to figure out
How you fit in those pants.
On the road every night
So you right across the party
And I like what I see.
Well tonight you a freak.
And brought me right upstairs
And then she make me say...
See life's a crazy thing man
For all the shit life will leave at our shoes
On the door step like the daily news
Whether or not I'm the popular sound
The radio station on public opinions
Just turn the volume high and then vibe to it
But step back and let me do just that
Just turn the volume high and then vibe to it
Drive real slow with them seats down low
But this life of mine is like Life of Pi
Ain't no time taken stressed out
And burn another from my fresh ounce
Just turn the volume high and then vibe to it
I can't go every day with being sober
To either heaven or hell every second I get older
Till I'm dead or in a coma
You're supposed to live every day like it was your last
If this was my last twenty four
I'd probably spend at least three of four praying to God for twenty more
I'm looking in the mirror at the man in front of me
Like I know everybody goes but I'm twenty three
I'm getting my money's worth every second
I'm not sober all the time
You bring me down at least you try
Until we see this eye to eye
I'm a nineteen year old rebellious fuck
Living each day like the next I might not wake up
That's why I always stay puffing a blunt with a full cup
Popping pills out the bottle till it's hollow
And if I'm not here tomorrow light an L in my memory
Gotta know I made a mark on this short time on Earth
With his hands in front of him
Just waiting for some shit to hit the fan
I may not be in tune with reality but my music is sick
And I'm so high that I defy gravity
Live life and enjoy it
I like dancing in the dark
Spend all my money on clothes
Wear make up to go to bed
But I only sleep naked
Say anything in my head
Put my hands up till you hang loose
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo oh
Not being like you is what I happen to be
Uh all my sanity is stepped away
I got cartoons tatted all over my whole body
I got two pet turtles and a frog
A gravity bomb and a fluffy white dog
Living in the attic in my parents house
Transform running when I hear the beat
Even if strange is what I appear to be
I give true to myself and its clear to see
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo oh
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo
All my weirdos stay and listen
Saying that I'm not normal is accurate
I walk around in boxers half the day
But they still press play
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo oh
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo
Ain't no tee ball but its still easy to hit them
Look there's a laundry load full of wife beaters and socks
But I can step a straight line just to follow a buck
12 beers deep and I'm the life of the party
Really its silly that you know this dude's nice
Standing under the fountain.
Different from your surroundings.
Ain't no doubt about it... beautiful with a balance.
Next thing you know you're broken.
He came to give you life and it more abundantly.
If you would just believe it.
It doesn't cost you nothing.
You can be made brand new.
He can restore your wings.
Standing under the fountain.
Different from your surroundings.
Ain't no doubt about it... beautiful with a balance.
You've got a world to conquer.
Take up your cross and follow.
You are the called and chosen.
Standing under the fountain.
Different from your surroundings.
I don't have to duplicate
There's an expiration date
I don't have to duplicate
There's an expiration date
Now I sing as a friend
I don't mean to offend
Rather choose not to pretend
Were gonna make some mistakes
For our freedom is in
I don't have to duplicate
There's an expiration date
Now I find it disturbing
We're dying from words
That we speak into our life
Such a powerful thing
Of our verbal suicide
Call it a trend or fad
So come out from among them
Living what we must live and breath
I don't have to do or say
Anything to duplicate
What this world has got
I don't have to compromise
What I got I don't despise
And I won't think twice
Sure I feel so good about it now
I don't have to duplicate
There's an expiration date
I don't have to duplicate
There's an expiration date
Hiding their true colors graffiti under the bridge
They wanted two summers but autumn caught them again
They house fell with the fallen now they gone with the wind
As luck would have it I would be good on my own but ain't enough four clovers
So Romans seven is what we left with
Many got saved and questioned where there flesh went
Like did it really pass away
No it gets better every passing day so whoever got vendetta got a plastic face
Every king and kingdom will pass away
I touch my feet on the ocean
Walking into the fire
Marching around the city
Healing the deaf and dumb
Playing away the evil spirits
And I can feel myself drifting away
And be honest as I call on your name
Because your the same god you were back then
Yes I can feel the reign
Preaching until they stone me
Looking out for the dove
Praying for the sun to stay up
Praying for the reign to come
Reaching out for your garment
Leaving my shame at the well
I can feel myself losing my head
I need your forgiveness
And be honest as I call on your
After the father that came
Oh I can feel the reign
Yes I can feel the reign
Take me from this desert
And I need to feel you praise again
Surrounded by my selfishness I don't know where to go
Quench my thirsty soul
Quench my thirsty soul
I'm all good for a rendezvous
You give me the time and place
We just need to set it straight
To get them out is the only reason I'm in this
Curiosity killed you like 9 times
Devil on the bottom. shining my shoes
So it might as well be Him
Couldn't keep it a hundred if you had 20 hands
Cause Hip Hop made the best of us act fools
To clear the air of this dust called us
We got beef in the Body and we keep getting haughty
And I ain't spend 10 years plus sleeping on my dreams like a narcoleptic
Who eats the bread of life
In the kingdom of God
You're invited by the king
All is ready in the kingdom of God
So he sent me out to show you to your seat
But the first one said
And the second one said
I just bought yoke of oxen
I gotta go and check them out
All these excuses made
He said to go through every city
Come on and dine with us
Just come exactly as you are
To come and dine with us
He said to go through every city
Come on and dine with us
Just come exactly as you are
To come and dine with us
But there's nobody here
Is filled with empty seats
That eats the bread of life
In the kingdom of God
There's an open invitation to the feast
But the first one said
And the second one said
I just bought yoke of oxen
I gotta go and check them out
All these excuses made
He said to go through every city
Come on and dine with us
Just come exactly as you are
To come and dine with us
He said to go through every city
Come on and dine with us
Just come exactly as you are
To come and dine with us
And I will give you rest no
To come and dine with us
It's the last of evil days
The elect shall fall away
There's still time for you to be saved
Just come exactly as you are
To come and dine with us
I don't mean to be ungrateful
But you know I gotta plateful
But the truth is all this time I've never known You like I thought.
I would be remiss if I continue
To go another day not knowing You.
I'm running after You...
Precious moments feel like heaven...
So let me take you to the start
And I'm not just looking for attributes
And I'm not just looking for attributes
Hearts they can break
They're not strong enough
They lie all the time
There's so much you still don't know
So I strongly suggest that you
Listen to me when I tell you
Things are getting shorter
I've been running wild
Completely out of order
You can take my cares
Standing in the need of prayer
I'll need to slow down
Listen to me when I tell you
Why do we even worry about yesterday
Knowing Christ could come tomorrow
Stay here forever on the Isle of You
Give you your roses while you're still here
Baby He knows I'm no good alone
And you bring out the best in me
Let me tell you about the way you make me feel
Stay here forever on the Isle of You
Give you your roses while you're still here
In the age of marriage we can take our time
Some things really last forever
Smell the tenderness of intimate passion
And every rose has thorns
But we can bleed together
I'll always treasure the Isle of You
You are my heart until the day that death do us part
I am staying on the Isle of You
So take me where no one else can go
You are my garden I'll help you grow
Until forever I love you
For the rest of my life I'm gonna be right by your side
Just a little bit of loving in the making everyday baby
And I'm going to cherish it until I'm gone
Just think of me as your soldier I'll always fight for ya darling
I want you to be everything God made you to be
I feel like it don't matter anymore
Getting used to the way the world turns
But I must say it spinning really fast when I look at her
If I was just a few years younger
Girl I could be your boy wonder
Got a ring on my finger
But it feels so guilty to get to slip it off when I fold my hands
I just wanna give you my number
And call like snow in the summer
I keep it undercover but I
Gotta call heads or tails
Throw my nickels and my pennies and my dimes in a wishing well
Wanna be your triple digits
Be a millionaire for a minute
Make some lemonade with these lemons
But I could barely pay attention
I don't even know why I'm signed to a record label with an artist and repertoire
But I don't wanna swim in the mainstream
Told myself to please stay strong
She ain't going home and I
Don't you think of me anymore
And please stay close
A song of a siren caught my iris
Slow wind from her island just crashed into the
Coastline and Poseidon attacks the new me
And she just wanna thrill a man
But when Gilligan's on the wheel again
Like in the willows and spinning like ceiling fans
She just wanna share my light
Got a wife and daughter
Aiming for the fence but the game is dangerous
Told myself to please stay strong
She ain't going home and I
Told myself to please stay strong
She ain't going home and I
I wanted to make love
She wanted to break up
I was ready to try again
She wanted to be friends
But I thought we'd always be together baby
And everybody looking at me like I'm crazy
It's ever so Cupid how we fell for the weather tho
You leave me no option
You distorted the portrait
You've been more than important
Blazing the trail was pointless
It's been more of a Jordan shrug for me
But nowadays ain't much more than a hug for
Enigma why I ain't cried yet
Gone till November and then some
Gone till November and then some
Gone till November and
I don't wanna start all over
Took me too long to grow up
I feel like I don't know even her
Hear them whispering in my ear
That's just the way it is
We exchange vows from I do to adieu like we
Invisible document of entitlement
Dancing at fast speed
It's like Heaven seems colder
Cause love is what made us
And I'm still ready to try again
Cause love is what made us
I wish I had it figured out by now
My fair lady's in a dungeon
My lovely London bridge is falling down
Watching from the distance
Wish I could make a difference
But I just make it difficult
I've done enough damage for the both of us
Thinking I should hit the road
You just may be gone forever
And I can't leave you here
We gone disappear together
The ship was never really safe at bay
I learned to love your shining armor
Don't forget to let me lead the way
Watching from the distance
Wish I could make a difference
But I just make it difficult
I've done enough damage for the both of us
Thinking I should hit the road
You just may be gone forever
And I can't leave you here
We gone disappear together
Now you mad at me and it's tragic
And I'm more of like a whale in that well
Rather a faucet or Titanic
I promise you I won't vanish
You just may be gone forever
And I can't leave you here
We gone disappear together
She used to think that she was ahead of her time
Waiting for a chance to romance with somebody in her league
Every fella that ever tried to tell she Cinderella
They find out she's walking on glass
And right now a pauper is a feasible offer
Maybe I'll just have to fake a smile after all
It may be a lonely evening after all
He used to think he was headed to the top
And it was only just a matter of time till he makes it
At they had since he was born
And all the while he sees all the problems that can come with blowing up
And wonders what he's still fighting for
Maybe I'll just have to wait a while after all
And maybe I won't keep dreaming after all
Maybe it won't be easy after all
Maybe I'll just have to fake a smile after all
Maybe it won't be easy after all
I don't wanna be fooled
Into falling in love with you
It seems like we were just getting to know one another so well
Hello always means goodbye
I won't stop telling you everyday how much I need you a round
I know you're up in the sky but I don't know when you'll be back down
I wake up looking for you but I guess it depends on the day
Just tell me which one to say
My mother's voice was soft rain
And my daddy's was more like a hurricane
Saying son you better learn to pray
I been gone for a while
And my daughter's days have been blue and gray
I can see the same story in her eyes
I won't stop telling you everyday how much I need you a round
I know you're up in the sky but I don't know when you'll be back down
I wake up looking for you but I guess it depends on the day
Just tell me which one to say
I won't stop telling you everyday how much I need you a round
I know you're up in the sky but I don't know when you'll be back down
I wake up looking for you but I guess it depends on the day
Don't know where I'm going or how I got here
Excuses that I'm human
And I've been doing this for so long
Uh uh ain't gonna happen
Uh uh I've been the Charlie Chaplin of rapping
Time to open the caption
And I'm in an alley with matchboxes
Until I disregarded my God and we had problems
Don't know where I'm going or how I got here
Excuses that I'm human
And I've been doing this for so long
Let me give you a vision I was a boy
Taking care of the family
He was always employed
He's in love with Leann
She was always his joy
I still hear the tune
Developed a good shot with bad form
I'm looking back for him
Don't know where I'm going or how I got here
Excuses that I'm human
And I've been doing this for so long
Well it's easier said than done
All of these options I don't really have a clue
All of this thinking and really I just need to move
Don't know where I'm going or how I got here
Excuses that I'm human
And I've been doing this for so long
Hands in my pockets like let's play it cool
Bottle of cologne on my dresser
I'm sentimental as ever
As if I live for the aroma of sweet dreams
King of getting off Scott like Coretta
When I mention it was later grow early summer in May
You said you'll never forget me
You only keep me around
When you're all alone in Eden
No church in the wild
Never would've thought that we would get caught up
It's so wild in the church
I speak about the past like it's the present
And the present like it's the past
I wanted to tell my dad a couple days ago
Trying to blame it on you like they hooked onto umbilical cords
I know they live for the Lord
Some of them women in war
Trying to use they spiritual sword
I remember when y'all met each other
When I see the all the pain and the tears on your face
You only keep me around
When you're all alone in Eden
You only keep me around
Your scars are safe here with me
But I can't keep chasing a heart that don't wanna be caught
There was hope for you and me
Take my heart out for a drive
Guards down now we're rolling
There's danger in the road ahead
Your scars are safe here with me
But I can't keep chasing a heart that don't wanna be caught
There was hope for you and me
Take my heart out for a drive
Guards down now we're rolling
There's danger in the road ahead
Set foot in this door again
Floors still creeks beneath me
And I don't wanna wake the demons
And the heat is rising
Everything inside is screaming turn around now
I said it's now or never
And I hear it calling
But I don't know if I have the aware of thought
To come back down those really cold corridors from the basement floor
In the hands of my greatest mistake of my darkest secret
Saying goodbye to you is like tearing my heart in two
I gotta close the door
I gotta close the door
I gotta close the door
I gotta close the door
Sorry that I have to leave you here
I gotta close the door
I'm no good when I'm around
I gotta close the door
When the fantasy is gone
When the fantasy is gone
Never coming back again
Never coming back again
I gotta close the door
Even second guess is having issues
Your eyes are windows
I see everything I remember
So I'd have roses in December
Still bleeding from my own thorns
Pedals falling in the rain
Still looking for the rainbow
I can't wait till the sun shines again
I feel like I been looking for love you see on TV
Sometimes I know I make it hard to understand me
But I won't give up it's too hard for me to walk away
And I'm working hard to love myself
Before I love anyone else
Still feel like I'm looking for love that we see on TV
Sometimes I know I make it hard to understand me
But I won't give up it's too hard for me to walk away
You're so easy to love
You're not perfect but you're easy to love
I know I got a long way to go
And I don't want to go alone
You can hear all the whispers like a song in the wind
And I don't know where it's coming from
I only know where it's been
It's like my mind's been disturbed and lately
Sometimes I know it may be hard to understand me
But I ain't giving up I ain't walking away
Even when it's hard loving you
Even when it's hard loving me
Even when it's hard loving me
I just don't want my heart to turn to stone
So I let myself forget that you've been gone for a spell
And well it's been quite some time
You left when I was young
I lay in my bed reciting songs you never sung
And I only knew you as the phone that never rung
And I told everyone I was loved by a ghost
I told everyone I could feel you almost
But you never called me and you never wanted to
I used to have your picture in my phone
I'm used to making decisions on my own
It's not easy never having you here
I guess I got used to only seeing you in the mirror
And I told everyone I was loved by a ghost
I told everyone I could feel you almost
But you never called me and you never wanted to
That can conquer every fear
It's like another one leaves me
Every time I wipe my tears
And it's so hard seeing your face in the mirror
But I'll tell everyone that I'm loved by a ghost
I'll tell everyone that I feel you almost
The way I wanted you and more
Stone they all rejected
Still you did the unexpected
And stepped down from the throne
Lower than the angels
No one else can save us
I spend my days wondering where I belong
Any more these tears are memories
I see a dim reflection in the mirror
And my lungs are filled with guilt
Effecting how I breathe
On the ring upon your finger
I've been married to this dream for so long
That I've forgotten what it means to remember
That I'm nothing on my own
I still don't see the worth
But you would trade the world
Now my hands are waiting
Just to touch your face
As the distance between us disappears
In the final hour I'm in search for the time
Just to capture this moment of forever
A thousand words later
The picture is worth so much more
And I know that I just can't explain myself
Stone they all rejected
Still you did the unexpected
And stepped down from the throne
Lower than the angels
No one else can save us
Keep fighting the thorn piercing flesh through the bone
I wish that tomorrow was already told
Entrusting the Lord with my heart and my soul
Giving Him praise for this ride till it's over
Dodging the darts that seem to come my way
I guess I'll wait to find out what glory looks like
Swaggers just overrated
Sliding in my lane and I'm kicking the door down
Swimming up the river I know that I can't drown
Plus I ain't no good in my home town
High thoughts bringing the saints low
Bright lights turn into faint glows
Once upon a time the people pleaser in me would hold back
Till God said this message is much bigger than rap
Preaching at people with no love
Stay looking at sinners with cold shrugs
The like minded get met with warm hugs
If you don't agree then throw a stone
Thinking who's who it's the attack of the clones
I'm at the final table when cards is being shown
Gotta keep my hands folded
And Lord if I'm doing it wrong then please stop me
And Lord if I'm doing it wrong then please stop me
And I already know I'm not untouchable
God said love your neighbor like you love yourself
But when a man wants a man then he's on the shelf
She say she feel like a man and just wants some help
So I apologize for the Paul disguise
We been wearing without solving the Saul inside
And Lord if I'm doing it wrong then please stop me
And Lord if I'm doing it wrong then please stop me
I think it's time for me to turn the mirror round
I'm fighting to believe I'm free
I do it for free if my grass will still grow
I'm wrestling like Jacob
Wondering what I'm made of
And Lord if I'm doing it wrong then please stop me
I don't want to fight with you any more
Don't you wave the flag I'm not over you
Just another love roller coaster
The closer I get you lock the door
I don't want to get involved so I'll keep my guard up
Open up these doors you'll get more than you wanted trust
You'll have me going crazy if I let you have the key
I just can't get in so I'm feeling like you
Don't want no wanna know what you're thinking
You won't tell your secret it's only me
I don't want to get involved so I'll keep my guard up
Open up these doors you'll get more than you wanted trust
You'll have me going crazy if I let you have the key
Oh my lord I feel this sinking in
I never want to be just friends
You'll have me going crazy if I let you have the key
I'm not afraid to watch you go
And I'm not afraid to watch you leave
And I'm not afraid to set you free
It's one in the morning
And I'm trying to ignore it
But this problem isn't going away
I'm tired of fighting
And I'm tired of writing
So hard to find the words to say
I'm not afraid of the games that we'll play
Or afraid of us fading away
With the ups and the downs we've been through
I'm so afraid of the way I love you
I can't explain what I don't know
With all this pain I love you so
As long as it ends with you and me
I don't know what I'm doing
And this problem isn't going away
I'm tired of fighting
And I'm tired of writing
So hard to find the words to say
I'm not afraid of the games that we'll play
I'm not afraid of us fading away
I'm not afraid that you'll always be true
But I'm afraid of the way I love you
But I don't want to see you go
And I don't want to watch you leave
I'm giving up on all my pride
So I can give you all of me
It's three in the morning
The problem isn't going away
So I'll keep on fighting
Till I find the words to say
I'm not afraid of the games that we'll play
Or afraid of us fading away
I'm not afraid that you'll always be true
But I'm afraid of the way I love you
Than being afraid with you
Than being afraid with you
But the thing that's better
Than being afraid with you
Since the first day of school and such
Skipped study hall for extended lunch
Wish I only had to ask for your forgiveness once
Wish I only had to ask for your forgiveness once
And Julian has been my Uncle Dutch
He was saying I shouldn't be in a rush to add friends
And he knows how I can be like Don Draper
Should be looking for an alter pleading for the blood
All day getting offers and even after dusk
Wolves as sheep are quick to eat you up for dinner
Send you on your way sinner
Man I gotta watch who I'm amongst
Lord knows I'll be the first to announce my shame
Before you know my business though
First order of business bro
Please properly pronounce my name
I feel like the whole world waiting on me
Seen a number in her phone I don't recognize
I seen a brick wall when I read her eyes
Not a one not a Ray unless I'm blind
To come back to the ground
May I borrow your state of mind
13 dimes all at the same time
Her demeanor was indeed one of a kind
13 dimes turned to 13 ghosts
Now everybody worry like how will he survive
Please come clean before you compare
And I feel like the whole world waiting on me
I'm telling you the whole world waiting on me
50 shades they don't know me well enough to catch me
So dope to see you the other day
Your music is coming from a nice well sir
You know sometimes I can't believe it's you
They used to think that we in different lanes
We knew this could be dangerous
And I can't do what people do
Just for the sake of making it
It's such a love and hate relationship
And man I don't want to be like nobody else
I'll still be cool with it
Long as my album don't stay on the shelf
But I know this life is beautiful
Too many things almost made me forget
That this is what I'm called to do
You know this game ain't for the faint at heart
I try to remember everything you taught
I hope you like the picture that you painted Art
And mom I know you wanna play your part
It's difficult to point this gun at the man I hope I don't become
A wise man once told me some words worth repeating
He said in this life glory is fleeting
I can see the light at the end of the tunnel baby it's been a long road
It's been a long road
Baby you know it's been a long road
Not much time is left
Used to live up north from the Hudson but east side is home
Marlo knows I'm the art work that art work to preserve sins
I was born living lightly and versed
Now I'm older and think I'm a perfect mix
This God given talent was always a challenge of mine
I try to explain it but really its harder to find
I'll never conform to the way they think I should shine
Counting pills with my crew top billboard and when my album came out I was still employed
Sorry this ain't no pity party love my wife for her mind and not just her pretty body uh
My God not to mention my daughter got that swag like that mama looking just like her father I know
I tried to explain but really its harder to define
You know the funny thing is I think they know me now
Running through my city I think they know me now
Feel like it took forever I think they know me
My family rolling with me and I won't let you down
If there's one thing I know true love will never change
Already gave my heart away nobody else could take your place
There's nothing I want more than for you to understand
I'm trying to get that up for you just tell me what to do
I think you're looking for something more than gratitude
The feeling we had some time ago we both want it back lets take it slow
I'm not in a rush but I want to make it clear
I'm trying to get that up for you baby it takes two
Love that only you can satisfy
Maybe this was worth the wait
And with this love we'll live our lives
World so cold everyday
I feel so alone and far away
Then You came out of nowhere
Though you came out of nowhere
And brought me to You
Though you came out of nowhere
And brought me to You
I feel like falling and I reach for Your hand
Then You came out of nowhere
Though You came out of nowhere
Though You came out of nowhere
And carried me through
Though You came out of nowhere
And brought me to You
But why would I leave when You kept me from harm
You brought me to you
Though You came out of nowhere
And carried me through
Though You came out of nowhere
And brought me to You
But things got tense when they couldn't get the pretty house with the white picket fence
But don't you know that where he came from they don't have those things
It took him long enough to save up just to buy that ring
She hears him singing no one knows the trouble that I've seen. She grew up in a happy home he had to make it own his own
She seemed a little nervous on the way home got a lost no signal on the phone
They put a call out for a suspect that looks just like him
Around his height around his weight and he's got darker skin. Sir I need you out the car I'm calling backup and
Is it something that we do to ourselves
Its hard I know and you deal with it everyday
Trust God be strong he'll never lead you astray I'm hear for you no matter what comes our way
Monday night in the living room caught chills when they turned on the news
Missouri full of misery had to kiss his wife on the cheek
They'll get over it after awhile is more concerned about what to tell his child
Is it something that we do to ourselves
Let me talk about the One
Who taught me how to love
I saw Him on the water
He was bidding me to come
With every step I hesitate
And my faith ran away
You're everything I need
You're right next to me
I follow You through the darkness
Will You take away my fear
I will follow You when the sun shines
And the shadow is drawing near
Down the long and winding road
You'll always lead me home
If the water looks too deep
And the desert looks too dry
With every step I take
I feel the weight go away
When I didn't think of you
I follow You through the darkness
Will You take away my fear
I will follow You when the sun shines
And the shadow is drawing near
Down the long and winding road
You'll always lead me home
You still remain unshakable
To come in from the rain
I follow You through the darkness
As you took away my fear
I'll follow You in the valley
As You wipe away my ears
I follow You when the sun shines
And the cloud have disappeared
It's been a long and winding road
This about report to the commissioner
To all the critics that had me counted out
To all the cynics I fought and Thought they had me figured out
Who opened doors on 32 tours
38 countries in the name of hip hop
Political rhyme practice
I gave cause you lack this
And to be judged by a hit
By some counterfeit click
That's some bell curve shit
Relax the saluting arms carry on and carry on
My record speaks for itself I never stopped the hip hop
And I never jumped backwards or kissed myself
Public Enemy number one
If you don't know me you can call me
Can't win without beginning it
Heed the word of the brother and the voice that got muscles in it
Rhymes without education equals butter from the gutter
And you say ho hum another story to bore me
The last Bohemian but you'll never see me intoxicated
By bones in drug zones I hate it
The rhymes can hurt and do work
Is down down to the one and shoot
Public Enemy number one
Public Enemy number one
If you don't know me you can call me mister
I don't care for Range Rovers
Cause the price is too high
Low budget I am believe me when I speak it
Limousine ain't a damn thing unless they let me keep it
Public Enemy number one
Public Enemy number one
If you don't know me you can call me mister chuck
Yeah some of y'all flip like wills never got
We gonna do a song that you never heard before
NO comeback stories NO corny
Choruses No glories NO hallelujahs
Who begin wit ends and end wit NO ends
NO stress beams NO accusations
Cop chases or court cases
Shoot outs and NO sellouts
NO thoughtless flows NO woes
NO volunteers getting peers of career
NO solutions NO problems
NO more vinyl revolving
NO happy campers NO offense
The easiest and the hardest word to say is NO
Only takes a second to say it
The easiest and the hardest word to say is NO

If I can't change the people around me
I change the people around me
They don't know what's next
Who didn't recognize how great and
Clever some of those rhymes be
Mad vocab to silly crabs
Your ass like taxi cabs
Hit my toll free number
To hear bombs I dropped
1st time rhymes played me off like Sacramento Kings
3-6 for the 9-6 1 move my rhymers with the times
Wit no crimes or pantomime
No great pretender spenders
From the rear old school getting theirs
It is on and on and 3 steps ahead
Hot topics shock in the house
Getting burned while you learn on a hospital bed
Jack be nimble on the brain
But the sound remains insane
Round and round here I go
Putting this sound down
But some a y'all got fears and scared to get
If I can't change the people around me
I change the people around me
They don't know what's next
They don't know what's next
Now I'm the one who flew over the Cuckoo's nest and tested
And wasn't ever bullet proof vested
Resurrection of the one man vocal section
Spirit in your dark ass direction
For your mind body and soul protection
Reality checks keep it real
On and off the road been through
Those influenced under the influence
Getting mad hits from truants
A million doomed consumers
Who say they know they black
Threw they medallions back
In exchange for 40 dozen six packs
It's getting ill so many funerals
I didn't know under fros
We got so many black Italians
If I can't change the people around me
I change the people around me
They don't know what's next
They don't know what's next
They don't know what's next
They don't know what's next
Class of 78 sunset strip
But the love we shared was for the art of noise
Dump puff a smoke make me cough
But I'm not a chimney
So you can't call that shit soft
Swore their breath stunk
Now a style is your hair or something you wear
Till your brains polluted
Won't be the last time
Cause it ain't the first
Where did that come from
Only the labels can explain
But they play dumb while they take from
Tell me what have they done for me lately but hate me
So they can't stop me
The rhyme animal has resurfaced
It all comes down to this
I give a damn so I curse
So do I dare disturb the universe
See I always been a rebel
Now I got my own kind blind
Brain trained on the devil level
You don't measure a man by what he got
A brother like me annoys em
Everybody wanna be Big Willie
Ruff stuff to the babies spread like ravens
To the heads of heads but I ain't crazy
Chorus to the chorus verse to verse
Crazy I'll plead insanity
Just to save humanity
Be good like no Johnny
Not their imaginary Rocky
Get me then acquit me attack me
Here here watch a brother duck the chair
Upstairs who got no pears
I'm not part of the click
Many times rhymes forget
Some ain't heavy like others
But they still be my brothers
A chip off the whole block
I shock and get the word in
Maybe that's why a brother like me shoulders the burden
I smells between the white sheets
Don't front step to the circle
Mad at the man no doubt
Mad at the man no doubt
Mad at the man no doubt
But to the rest it's a nightmare
Spending more time in the air than
The rhyme got winded on the way up
On what I thought was a lay up
These two cent criticizers can't size
We don't realize we all under a microscope
Of a nation of other folk
Attitude have we forgotten
So that the younger gees and bees
Think all we can bees is a big dreamer
Some stuck in that 96 Lexus per minute shit
That head of even heads
To some I'm prophetic
To the rest I'm pathetic
Against the feds and point spread
There once was a time
We fought the power with a rhyme
Mad at the man no doubt
Mad at the man no doubt
Mad at the man no doubt
But to the rest it's a nightmare
We don't need to be no Big Willie
Last verse check it out...
Got more hits than Pete Rose
Can I get down like Craig Mack
And brought it to a different level
Against the so called devil
Who had the nerve to throw a bell curve
Lemme go let I grow no
I've been through the afro
It's been a long time so my childhoods
That was swept under the rug
Not what you thought it was
Mad at the man no doubt
Mad at the man no doubt
Mad at the man no doubt
But to the rest it's a nightmare
Mad at the man no doubt
Mad at the man no doubt
Mad at the man no doubt
That studio session you set up 24 extincts today
I already called to set it up
This beast prepared a horizontal feast
His enemy is going public
He going public about this vertical snowflakes
Just give me just one more hit
Just give me just one more hit
Just give me just one more hit
Brain on a wide so train
Brought to you by the ultimate sin
Peace this is Griff...
And we bring it full circle
See my rhymes be hot like soul food spots
I don't give a damn Jenny Jones
To be some known folks
Between soap operas and bras
Gossip by their own admissions
Failed smoke emissions
Cursed the nation the doom generation
The next voice you hear
If you know what I mean
He say she say they all got beef
Bad things is some of them think its cool
But in real life they live in projects
And trailer parks all the bullshit they talk
Makes me wanna spark L's
Looking at channel zero from hell
The poison that they feed in this my mind
On my big screen TV believe me
They do it for the greed of the fame
Following the trends of the Hollywood game
Looking like fools on the tube
Just to get the damn cream
Talk show host really TV evangelist
With lies they can't handle it
Mad Drama trauma coming at you out to harm ya
Infect your mental with an infectious type of insomnia
Lies in disguise about women who really guys
And guys who really women like that's such a big surprise
Best understand black man is infinite potential wise
Realize TV amazing confusion type illusion
Brought to your brain cell
It's all brain wall syndrome
Sending you in a cyclone
Plus had for your health so best leave it alone
Bad things is some of them think its cool
You say lemme try this
Way back when medicine
Scaring some of our children
Soul brother number one
Is back in black in you kitchen
Hotels and airplane tickets
Embarrass our asses and degrade
End of the day ain't that a bitch
Bad things is some of them think its cool
Talk show created the fool
Little is known why I beckon and moan
After the math the drug lords brought the wrath
Of those of us who once thought we needed to be weeded
I remember came after
What looks like fire is ice
Catch it twice like Jerry Rice
Against odds I recognize it in the cards
Hard to be played back and black the jack of all spades
Ash to ashes blunts to blunts
I hope they around next year but I fear
But what good is the rhyme without substance
Now back to the underdog
Who they least expected
Who they least expected
The rhyme never thanks
Now I can't use my name
But one thing I can do is finger roll
The hit list grows like Pete Rose
As I rise above who you recognize
I wanna know that disguise
I don't know where you come from now see how you run
First on a verse I gets vertical
Flip works like a grammatical gigolo
A head from many years ago
Never claimed the best
Nor was I great at finesse
But everything is everything
And everything is real
It appears I shift gears
To the ears of my peers
I'd rather be the underdog
Who they least expected
Who they least expected
Ashes to ashes blunts to blunts
Who they least expected
Not another nitwit you can get with
Thinking now that later
I get ill on a beat track
Make me wanna go back
I rather be the underdog
Who they least expected
Who they least expected
Who they least expected
Who they least expected
We had indentured bond servants
But take our black slave sir
Now you wanna kill me
Now you wanna kill me
Cause my lyrics be true
Some of y'all slept on yourself
Next time you hit the mirror black
Turn you back on yourself
I wouldn't trust some a y'all
I'd cut it off at the wrist
Like you name was Benedict
Bout their master crackers giving out
Disasters in the hood
Phony honeys be gone when they moneys be gone
Now you wanna kill me
Now you wanna kill me
Cause my lyrics be true
Shined and simonized foreclosed
Bit they grills be rotten
Fuck the preacher he don't reach
Now you wanna kill me
Now you wanna kill me
Cause my lyrics be true
Brother Isac drop it on the groove one time
Then you know where you need to go
Come together and survive
It's time to learn to love again
It's time to stand out and be near
Think about your history
And free it from your misery
Learn... to love again
It's time to learn to love again
It's time to learn to love again
It's time to learn to love again
As you witness I'm surrounded by 2 more emcees
Introducing my Doberman
Through battle zones of microphones
I'd even room with Dr. Doom
Executives in suites eat dinner and discuss
I step forth from the jungle in fatigues.
I'm sitting on grenades
Little women squirming from the 12th down to 11th grades
When they see me in the magazine
Upon they wall they stick the page
But you're too young I'll take you mom
And shacked from shells and bombs
Uncle Sam make brothers Uncle Toms in Vietnam
Up in the lights form them days in
Her man got a death wish
Battle zones on and on
Battle zones on and on
And ah... I wanna hear Dow Jones
My name is Dow from the clique about to die
Others call me John Conner and perhaps
I'll tell the reason why
While Hiroshima blackens up the sky
I will lounge inside my shelter as you fry
As you're incinerated
I'll come around again forget me not
I had to shine with darkness for a minute
From the men without hats
I seem to be triple teamed
I stress the position
At the top of the slop
Like saltines out the box
Hot 97.5 on your dial
And another state of mind
They used to call me a rhyme animal
I try a new style refuse to get wild
On the B side because I still got my pride
The pride comes from another time
My father and mother plus God
Born in 1960 seventy suckers quizzing
Me what was it like before everybody
Tried to be like Mike
Back in the day when our peeps had to fight for our rights
But there is no is without a was
No about to be buts or because... I got the
Reminiscent of another time
See it wasn't just about the fro
It was what was underneath that fro
Black power for the powerless
I was in third grad when Dr. King got slain
And if I had to read a book about
Would be overlooked look
What I had learned in my youth
What a difference a score and a
Decade makes mistakes and super bad
I ate the food in the lunch programs
And now I see the young strung out on
Grams so I work on a go on
And so on and soon communicate to
Get the young straight
Woodstock to Kent State
Music of the time for the mind
Assassinations Presidents
Now in order for us to know
Who we are we got to know
Who we was and once we know
Who we was then we know who
Put pride inside plus taught karate
Fed heads in many ways many days
Now today the old must spread it
If they don't communicate then the
Problems have to be solved they
Won't go away so man what
You say and don't sway
Harlem that is black gold
I reserve the right to be nothing
We reserve the right to be nothing
We staked out your shit last night
Feeling the vibe for death
To make you strangle on you blood fluid.
Sleep walking with the machete saying
Mr. Machete telling you bitches I'm ready
Never nervous behind the barrel
Trigger finger stay steady
It's the only way to survive the ride
I dedicated this to all you insects
My tracks be fat got them attracting like crack
Come one come all my shit be smoking like echo sauna
The underground went with digital
Toe to toe or pussy to dick
Head chicken heads practice on carrot
Spinach flips my lips
Sit on top of crystal bottle tips
On a rapper that a serpent
Luxury in his raps ain't facts
Keep it on the low black
No raps or Kodak just stacking cheese
Murdered human bodies executed vicious
Lift spitting and twist just
Flesh confronted nobody want it son
Son slaughter rip shit
On tracks that I eclipse with
No remorse a different flow continuous
Blends with no resemblance
Money and power till it's vengeance
One of the seven they couldn't hang
The last brother alive
But you look don't acknowledge
The mix with a quickness
Suckers fall and crumble
Freestyle what's the use
Record companies get the money
While you style for free
They talk wild for a fee
While you never ever recoup
They'll never give ya respect
Who'll sit down and show ya
Instead a some rich bitch lawyer
Against the curse of grain and submitted brain
Trained to submit the corporate reign
Migraines created by megabytes
The universe with new universes within
A world within a world saving the world from danger
Showing no love to thugs that rub me the wrong way
Nothing but cold nights and long days
When the woman ain't got nothing on me
Long after you're put to rest I'll still be here
Keeping the truth from the vocal booth
Then your chest and open you
Knowing a few will only make the grade
The court is now in session
Some only in it for the money
In the world turned upside down
A back lash hit the black fast
But pull my people for a track
Look forward to the black reparations for us to get the money back
Minds get lifted like the cross nails is broke off
My man Son Slaughter bout to slam
My first begin blended with strength vain to strike earth
The Son Slaughter mission will finish script
Strictly number number number number
My son rises at the east off Kentucky Fried streets
Get used to me though like a fantasy
Strong in reality molded from clay in the alley
Whether the whole world was a stage or a ring or a alley
Stood up for the hood of a power to the rally
Stand up for rights left the Congress
Right heres to the man who never left
Muhammad Ali don't take no mess
Black inspiration to the whole rest of the nation
And the rest of the world shook up the world
God is good and God is cool
That's all that is just don't get it confused
Talks too much yeah y'all could call it what you want
Can't feed me then you don't need me
Don't squeeze me can't house me but never doubt me
Till I'm gone to the break of dawn
Revolution in the house uh rock on
Down goes racism gotta beg my legs
Thin line between a athlete and a slave
Beyond a box changed the whole game
Refused to lose talk too much to lose
I'm in no circumstance see a damn thing wrong
So here goes the Ali circus closed circuit
In order to lead the people you gotta love the people
To save the people you gotta serve the people
To teach the people you better reach the people
Can you get with this swung arm slip you happen to miss
They converted to those that never heard it
I like that from the people up top
Rock rock rock rock rock rock the the the the the the
Rock rock rock rock rock rock the the the the the the
Rock rock rock rock rock rock the the the the the the fun fun fun fun fun
How can you be sitting there
Telling me that you care
The people suffer in the suffering
Some people got ways and means.
Some people won't wait for long.
I got so much trouble on my mind
Hear the drummer get wicked
I got so much trouble on my mind
Hear the drummer get wicked
What I have is not enough
Home boy I cut you up
I got so much trouble on my mind
Hear the drummer get wicked
I got so much trouble on my mind
Hear the drummer get wicked
I can't take it no more
This economy's out of control
I kick down your door
Put the weapon to your jaw
This time heads gonna roll
Come back and save my soul
Never settle for the silver muff
Let's see if you paused on 4
I've taken mine now it's the time
I be fighting for my dream my whole life
It's the west coastal going postal
I got so much trouble on my mind
Hear the drummer get wicked
I got so much trouble on my mind
Hear the drummer get wicked
My turn to take your grains
And what I bring is gonna swing
The world like a hurricane
What it feels like to go through
The war that I've been through
How it can make you mental
Gotta break these fucking chains
I got so much trouble on my mind
Hear the drummer get wicked
I got so much trouble on my mind
Hear the drummer get wicked
I got so much trouble on my mind
Hear the drummer get wicked
I got so much trouble on my mind
The world has never seen a million black men in one place
Open your eyes get wise and look alive focus your attention
Crosses of the colored man who claims he holds the keys to the safe
You tell me brothers got no options today
Gas and dope bullets and coke ain't the way
And we can leave the component alone
To raise up the black dead slaves like Lazarus
When I catch rays through the blaze holy essays
No more death days and vexed slaves possessed in caves
Brothers walk around dumb different and blind
Pregnant Earths always carry eggs
I pledge to never fall off the ledge
And blacks remain family like Sister Sledge
One two three I'm a G
But the God inside is that G I chose to be
The world is a stage and everybody plays a part
When I say black man you say go
Black man GO black man GO
Whatever happened to that forty acres and that animal
And that's a million black men in one place to set it straight
So black women applaud the black God
Damn that's how you know the world about to end
Rain hail snow earthquakes and a million black men
Upon the God indivisible
With liberty and justice for all cause y'all done made us miserable
Well we about a million deep on your front lawn
To get this out in the open the only way
Is for us to declare a black holy day
This shit we go through
Sometimes the drug's too
Seems like I need an escape
Most people ain't use to
Hearing shots when it's dark
Flashbacks of memories from everyday fights
But not for this long
Everything I do is wrong
And sometimes I don't even know what to do
Except in the day watch my skin bloom
Got trouble with the law
I got violence outside
In my dream to be a star
Never thought one person could
With a smile so bright
It always brighten my day
That drugs keep me sane
How can someone you love
I thought I saw your photograph
Having such a laugh in a magazine
But the walls came tumbling down
I thought I saw your photograph
Having such a laugh in a magazine
Annie and you were made for the big time
But the walls came tumbling down
I can't help but reminisce
Everyday I'm getting high
Make a dollar till I'm rich
See that money comes quick
But it's quicker to leave
And in the hood we so hungry
Makes us regular thieves
Live a life fueled by greed
Chase material things
Drink juice and smoke weed
Annie has us locked down
Just the feel of her skin
So many Annie shot down
That Annie came touched
Just a little too early on the block
Little sibling stay tough
Better days are far off
Keep your hope and stay up
A little heart is enough
I know these times is so hard
Trust me I feel it to
I pray to God for my people
Hope they making it through
Make a person fuck Annie
Just to see what's next
I thought I saw your photograph
Having such a laugh in a magazine
Annie and you were made for the big time
But the walls came tumbling down
Every night we hear the thunder
As it echoes through the building
When the kids come and play
Bullets rip through our children
It's a fast way to live
But in the hood it's uncanny
They can see me in they TV
But they'll never understand me
Took the soul out of life
It's kinda hard to make an empty bag stand upright
I know we gonna make it through the struggle
We gotta escape through the muzzle
Do the best for her child when the fathers not there
We ain't looking for no fucking handouts
But at least understand what our lives are about
There's no need for your remorse
Unless you living like we do
You'll never know it of course
I thought I saw your photograph
Having such a laugh in a magazine
Annie and you were made for the big time
One day at a time I see pain passing by
If I was to run away and life didn't last
So many questions and worries all in one
I wonder if happiness could be within a gun
Show me that I understand everything I wanna
So I'm sitting down thinking of where I lie
The words in my head is to live or to die
Your the man I'm holding on
With a breath I sing a song
Will the people cry in sorrow
I don't know if I'm alive or dying
But alone I be here crying
But I know one things for sure
Stripped from anything I ever loved most
Handled my stuff all these 17 years
Lived my life with death overcame my fears
I started as a nobody now I'm somebody
Life is full of is but with pain you gotta bear
This life I live could be lost within a stare
Always wondered which people I could trust
And when I rest my soul and my heart goes cold
Will my voice still live and tell the things that I told
Will my name still talk or will I be forgot yo
Your the man I'm holding on
With a breath I sing a song
Will the people cry in sorrow
I don't know if I'm alive or dying
But alone I be here crying
But I know one things for sure
I wonder if my brothers and sisters went away
If my family is dying then you'll know I'll put a fight
Nobody is forgotten every time they see a light
I'm gonna watch the world through my eyes or through words
This girl may be small but I'm still in this world
When you live like me you know deaths around the corner
Everyday of life I live to be a goner
Weather or not I make the game make the fortune
It's like every time I'm close I get farther
Your the man I'm holding on
With a breath I sing a song
Will the people cry in sorrow
I don't know if I'm alive or dying
But alone I be here crying
But I know one things for sure
U could call this the end you could call it good bye
Can't wait till I die see me rotten deep in hell
N if you think life is easy then son you must be blind
But reality cursed my life with full of stress
N it seems I always part from the people I love
Its more than I can bare
This is ma life that isn't fair
This song will be my last
I guess now it's my time to go
Each step I take closer see the darkness as it falls
Its more than I can bare
This is ma life that isn't fair
This song will be my last
I guess now it's my time to go
Don't give a fuck what anyone says we ride on any men
This is how we living chin
Finch town we move it silent deres no need to start no riots
What this hood shits about when really they just soft like baby food
But the police start bringing heat so now I'm forced to do just rap
But love ain't forever
It was almost 18 months and we spent it all together
Through whatever problems we faced we stayed strong through the weather
When it never really mattered we were so strung up in love
And I don't mean to be corny you're my angel from above
You showed me how life's supposed to be without the hate and drama
The memories of living this heartbreak gotta live it
This love is coming with it but nobody to give it
I never wanted to end it like this
I guess you gotta let go to know what's being missed
And I still do wish that things could all be different
But what's the point of being one if we always distant
Baby goodbye my lovely wife
Baby this was my last chance
I may never get to hold your hand again
I can say that I'm a better man
I'm so sorry that I tore your heart apart last night
And I'm sorry if I startled you again today
I didn't mean to take your dreams and make them seem so dry
I didn't mean to take your dreams and make them seem so dry
It's just a dream so I'm living on
Or make you do some more or times when no body can
I'm not celebrity best.
I ain't different from you.
It's just a dream so I'm living on
I do it for my people that speak without a voice.
It's just a dream so I'm living on
The fellas who's been
Who just had their fucking
Suffer from heart breaks
From promises to lies
To every tear drop that we cry
From struggles at their worst
So why do I feel lied to
Then I think I've had enough
The bullshit and the drama
All the smiles that we have
Is a story to be told
Nothing in this world
Could make up for all this bull
The problems that we face
Was something just reaching out
We should of took the hint
I mean what were we thinking
All those times we were together
Did you really think that
At this very age we shouldn't
The pain I can't explain
The pain I can't explain
Through these past few days
It's the first time i
Couldn't understand what we had
Was it all a waste of time
Now it's all this shit combined
To erase all our memories
It always feels like you fooled me
Nobody to blame but myself
I've been told by my sisters
How these guys are all the same
But you had me so convinced
That my world suddenly changed
U always made me smile
But a smile isn't forever
I thought we worked it out
Like those other times before
But the truth had to reveal
We can't live a lie no more
My dreams have disappeared
The pain I can't explain
The pain I can't explain
Who've gone through breakups
Who have felt the pain
And who has lost all hope
Living in the projects rubble but still we call it life
Get by with what we have although it's never much
N the dreams that we after only come out of the mouth
Now all I see about is the kids that love their music
And as the world starts changing
How can they know my troubles
If they can't see my struggle
What gets me through this life
One thing because music is my life
Sometimes I lie down and spark a bogey to my face
I was filled wit an anger that I couldn't control
Raised up being poor soon changed my life's sights
That where I'm from is a place where struggles all grew
That where I'm from is a place where struggles all grew
And as the world starts changing
How can they know my troubles
If they can't see my struggle
What gets me through this life
One thing because music is my life
What it is to slow jam is all about.
I see the world within your eyes
I can't believe my mind
And a girl that is so fine.
Now I wanna make you forever mines
Girl I want you to know
Girl you know I love you
Girl you know I love you
And it's crazy how it was meant to be
Nothing can ever change that
Living good bomb sex just to be exact
And I don't wanna ever let you go
See I still remember baby wen I picked you from the lot
But wen things got out of hand you was ready to explode
N believe me baby nobody in this fucking world
See my little little baby don't you know you drive me crazy
Ur the first thing I touch wen I wake up in the morning
U make me feel excited wen I'm still up yawning
But baby listen you know we can't ride no more
Still remember that day they threw you straight on to the floor
N I regret it baby you saw the tear from my eye
Oh girl I'd be in trouble if you left me now
How I depend on you to give me love
When I need it right on time you would
Girl there's something in the back deep down in my heart
I didn't see it at first but I knew it from the start
My feelings were distorted how could I connected
All you wanted was a man what you got was disrespect
But at the very same time I longed for a wife
A troubled kid from the block always looking for love
Seems like me and you girl we fit like a glove
Got a hug from a friend all you needed was some healing
But when we touched we got that very special feeling
You caught me from the back and I had to pop the question
I had a guilty face yes I was turning red
When you said those three words I had no more tears to shed
I laid you in the bed then I held you in my arms
Promised you the world girl and keep you from harm
I know I got a guilty face
Don't know where to go who to see yeah
I ain't never been the type to fall in love and that's true
But damn baby girl I'm infected with your flu
And you smile so beautiful it probably cure all the blind
And fuck being friends I got a million already
But I need a special girl for my own to be my lady
And you know you my baby and you got my love girl
You my diamond my wife my lover and my world
Ain't a single fucking girl that would ever catch my eye
The way my eyes dart on your breast and your thigh
Ha I'm just joking babe you know that I love ya
I wanna be with you forever kissing of ya
That way I show the world whose my mother fucking queen
You the reason I smile through the bullshit boo
Oh girl tell me what am I gonna do
I know I got a guilty face
Don't know where to go who to see yeah
I would travel into space just to bring you a star
And see the look on your face when I bring you to far
Some say the sunrise is the beautifulest thing
But I say seeing you is more precious than a ring
Its okay dry your tears all I got for you is love
When I hear your voice girl it's like an angel from above
Ain't a single fucking thing can never match my love for you
We had our little struggles but our love will never part
Trust me when I say this is coming from the heart
You're my equal my partner my smiles and my laughs
You my wife my life also known my better half
Just read my lips girl what I'm saying is true
You ain't lived till you love that's what they seem to say
And I guess I'll die happy knowing your love is here to stay
Oh girl I guess I'd better go
I could save myself a lot of useless tears
Girl I gotta get away from here
And I don't I don't know how
I would never imagine myself to be so blessed
With an angel from heaven
You're the first thing I think about when the sun shines bright
And you're the last thing I think about when I sleep at night
And I won't hesitate to call you the girl of my dreams
And how much you soothe my soul with a simple touch
You will never know just how much you mean to me
But I got the rest of my life just to help you see
But as long as I'm alive I wanna spend it with you
When I have you in my arms and I close my eyes
I wouldn't care if the whole would pass me by
Just to see you smile
Those late after noons together when the sun just sets
To those early morning talks
Girl you are the best
I'm so amazed that you're psyched
I ask questions too like how can a guy like me deserve a girl like you
I feel so blessed but at the same time so unworthy
I trust you with my heart
Everything about you is perfect
I cherish every hug and kiss
And I can't wait for the nights when I can hold you tight
Next to me with you as my wife
You're my hope when I'm helpless
When it's dark the light
I give you all that I have
And that is my love and my life
I would drop everything just to spend a second with you
I'll be right here for you
Even if times get rough
You hold the key to my heart
I would do anything for
Looks are great but your personality is so perfect
You're my perfect match
You're my infinity on a scale of one to ten
I mean every word that I say
The love that we share is never made to die
I just wanna make you happy
I'll forever love you with all my heart and soul
There's a time for everything and everything has its own reason
There's just somethings in this life that we can never control
An answer to a question that I never seemed to ask
N its funny how now we can both smile at our past
Behind this forced smile is a heart that ain't steady
But I do regret the fact I could have been so much better
But how can something make you smile while it brings so much pain
The only reason why I'm sitting here writing this song
N I accepted the decision even though its hurts me to
I feel so screwed now
It's what to choose now
True life is through now
Hood shit stuck in my heart
Just make it through here
Long gone innocent smiles
Good friends some that are lost
Loved ones don't come and check
Finch block Jane is set
Not knowing that nobody's near me
Fast lane come to a stop
All them days that I rocked early December
Days is slow to breathe
Feels like I can't see
No smiles right now it's true
But we going to make it through
It's just what surrounds me
There ain't no plan B
And then they blast ya
You're by yourself here
This ain't about fair
It's like a drought here
I know will come soon
Days is slow to breathe
Feels like I can't see
No smiles right now that is true
But we going to make it through
Days is slow to breathe
Feels like I can't see
No smiles right now that is true
A little something for those people that could never believe
N everyday I'm on the grind wish I could turn back the time
How the fuck can you judge my life if you never been through it
N one day ill change the world so deres no struggle no deprived
The sacrifices that I make in order to fulfill my plan
I got to many criminal records my life is so screwed
Live this life the hard way for I'm determined to make
To open eyes to a new era from all the songs I create
These 10 pussies with guns still not enough to break me
N wen I wake up in the morning its just weed that I spark
I'm sorry about the pain I made you feel.
I look for the sun but its raining today.
But I didn't know that I made everything worse.
But you didn't care when push came to shove.
Then you wouldn't have hurt me like I ain't shit.
I don't know how I could do you so wrong.
And now I can't believe that my love's torn apart
You were my everything and I really miss you
You were my everything and I really miss you
And play this with your new man.
And then sit and laugh as you're holding his hands.
It breaks in my soul when it tears me apart.
Now I wanna hold you until I can't hold you.
You told me you love me as you would hug me.
I can see clearly my love is not blind
You were my everything and I really miss you
You were my everything and I really miss you
I thought maybe you did too if you understand.
You'll always be my baby.
I remember all the times that I had with you.
You looked like an angel wearing that blouse.
But now I can't take all the pain that I feel.
I don't wanna hear that you no longer care.
Now on the inside it feels like I'm dying.
You were my everything and I really miss you
You were my everything and I really miss you
I just thought we were meant to be.
I guess now we never know.
There was not a thing that I could do
And each day passes I get stronger now
I seldom think what I must allow
Well it's probably my turn to hurt real soon
Well I don't know how that feels
Touched by hands that make me feel alive
All these thoughts well I can justify
Teach me all the things that I don't know
Well it's probably my turn to hurt real soon
Well it's probably my turn to hurt real soon
You are she who kills me
I never thought that you would push me into this hell you call me
You are she who kills me
I never thought that you would push me into this hell you call me
I never thought that you would push me into this hell you call me
But it doesn't really matter to me that much
You need a dollar sign
I'll pay your price to make you mine
Goddamn you taste so sweet
The taste of you just can't be beat
Spread for the camera's eye
Pop a pill so you don't cry
Just give yourself away
It's the way that you touch me...
I want you to be the star of my video
I want to hear you scream on my stereo
And I can't wait to get you in bed
Get down on your knees
Goddamn you taste so sweet
The taste of you just can't be beat
Spread for the camera's eye
Pop a pill so you don't cry
Just give yourself away
It's the way that you touch me...
I want you to be the star of my video
Hide your guilty conscience with my taste you are...
I can't wait to watch you steal your life feeding on me now
I know all about your disease
You are going to hate me
I'll hide the lie you protect bleeding on me now
It is yourself you neglect
This is going to break you
I know that you'll do anything for me
For now I'm your will to live
Like a starving child you'll beg for me
You are a credit to your addiction
You are going to hate me
This is going to break you
You better be ready to go
I will bring the weed and whiskey
And you can bring your blow
Hang on tight or bite on my dust
I don't need for you to tell me why
That this car is what gets you high
The needles pushing 105 and I think that I need more
Open to susceptibility
Or you will crumble down inside
You can't breathe you think you're smothering
Here for you now tell me everything
You may think that it's too late now
Open to susceptibility
Or you will crumble down inside
I question what you say to me
I am inside your mind and I will remove this
Systematically remove this
Take a look at the walls around
I've been locked in here for 13 years
Let me tell you what it's like for me
All my days turn into weeks of boredom
I've made my bed but I just can not get to sleep
Always wondering what went wrong
Changing me from all I've known
Take a look at the walls around
I've been stuck in here for 13 years
Let me tell you what it's like for me
All my days turn into weeks of boredom
I can't believe that I'm still alive
And I can't seem to kill what's inside of me
Helps me decide what I want to be
But this life only gives what it wants to give
Is this the life that I want to live
Is this the dream that I want to dream
Will you be there when I need to scream
I've always known that I needed you...
Is this the life that I want to live
I can't believe that I'm still alive
But this life only gives what it wants to give
Is this the life that I want to live
Is this the dream that I want to dream
Will you be there when I need to scream
I've always known that I needed you...
Is this the dream that I want to dream
Will you be there when I need to scream
I've always known that I needed you...
And I can't seem to kill what's inside of me
Helps me decide what I want to be
But this life only gives what it wants to give
I am hanging on your words and slipping away
And I am honest to you
Always I knew there's enough for me but not for you
Tear down the walls deep inside to bring me into you
I know I've got my problems
I just need your light to guide my way
Careful of the things I hear well I've already thought that twice today
Help me to understand
I wish I was slightly different
Take all of me and come back again
Search the world and found that I wish I was slightly different
I can feel your love and lust
Hoping that you know what's best for you
Help me to understand
Take all of me and come back again
Search the world and found that I wish I was slightly different
Take all of me and come back again
Search the world and found out once again
That I hope you'll be around to see
I cannot hide all my shame
No we should not hide
I cannot hide all my shame
No we should not hide
My goodies not my goodies
All I need is a few seconds or more
You can tell the lady to bring my lap
And I ain't coming back
So you can put the car right there
I'm the truth and I ain't got nothing to prove
And you can ask anybody
Still gonna have a pent up in a fabulous room
You may look at me and think that
I'm just a young girl but I'm not just a young girl
That's the way I gotta have it
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Looking for the goodies
Just because you drive a Benz
I ain't wit it so you already know
That's the way I gotta have it
It's just how I gotta have it
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Looking for the goodies
So damn hot but so young
You ain't got milk in your tongue
You don't play the game
I'll show you what bad is
Bad is when you capable of beating the bag
I've been working at it ever since
I came to this planet
I ain't quite there yet
But I'm getting better at it
Let me tell it to you once more again
Ain't one chick in here that I can't have
But these goodies boy are not
And I don't want your number
I'm not changing stories
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Looking for the goodies
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Looking for the goodies
Goodies make the boys jump on it
And I'm sophisticated fun
I eat fillet mignon and I'm nice and young
So you can hear my invitation
La la la... la la la la la la la la la
Now what I want you to do is come through to the crib right now
La la la... la la la la la la la la la
So don't ask me what I want
And get over here and see me
Act just like you need me
You always make me smile
Now my parents are gone
La la la... la la la la la la la la la
I know that you don't have a curfew
La la la... la la la la la la la la la
Now don't move too fast
But don't move too slow
Baby catch the rhythm that I'm giving you
Beauty should be your name
Tell me where you been all my life
Like to make you the one
I got some conversation
I can be your operator
Cause you are so fine
I can be your operator
Don't tell me anything
Man I want you so bad
Gotta make you my man
You what I need in my life
Baby there's no time to waste
I said all I wanna say
Anything for you and I
I got some conversation
I can be your operator
Baby you should call me later
Cause you are so fine
I can be your operator
I got some conversation
I can be your operator
Baby you should call me later
Cause you are so fine
I can be your operator
Handle it ladies bag it up
I don't even think I need to speed
Turn it up and make the speakers bleed
Handle it ladies bag it up
Handle it ladies bag it up
And I'm becoming best friends with the dial tone
I've called your cell and you're home and still I sit here alone
I know you see me on your caller ID
I said it would be nice if you could called somebody
And let somebody know that you all right
Like your on the other line
Why don't you pick up the phone
I know you see me on your caller ID
And let somebody know that you all right
I know you see me on your caller ID
Cause everything about you

You got my attention and it takes a lot
Baby say it's all good
So act like you hear me
So act like you hear me
I can hold ya down if you let me
You can live without her

You're like a brother but my lover you my get right

Here we are once again
I don't now why I'm here
Although you look so good to me
It's best that I leave
I'm scared of being next to you
Because of what I think I might do
I don't want to disturb the flow
I want somebody that's here to last
This moment is so tempting
Maybe if we just embrace
I kinda only make things worse
I just wanted to leave
I shouldn't wait for long
When you don't have to say a thing
I think it's best that I refuse
I'm scared of being next to you
Because of what I think I might do
I don't want to disturb the flow
I want somebody that's here to last
Would you open up a window
I think that I should go now
I'm scared of being next to you
Because of what I think I might do
I don't want to disturb the flow
I want somebody that's here to last
I'm scared of being next to you
Because of what I think I might do
I don't want to disturb the flow
I want somebody that's here to last
I'm scared of being next to you
Because of what I think I might do
I don't want to disturb the flow
I don't need me a basketball player
All I need is somebody that's down for me
And he don't have to have money
His love is just like honey
He can have everything in this world
But he'll sacrifice it all for me
And I made up my mind
I'm in love this time
And I know that he won't break my heart
And I know that we won't ever part
It's time for us to say goodbye
And I wanna be with him forever
They can say that I am crazy
For making him my baby
But it's how it's gonna be
It's gonna stay the same
I can have everything in this world
But I'll sacrifice it all for him
And I made up my mind
I'm in love this time
And I know that he won't break my heart
And I know that we won't ever part
It's time for us to say goodbye
And I wanna be with him forever
And all of the things that you do
They don't know how I feel
And I know that he won't break my heart
And I know that we won't ever part
It's time for us to say goodbye
And I wanna be with him forever
And I know that he won't break my heart
And I know that we won't ever part
It's time for us to say goodbye
So lets... keep it real...
Just forget about them other chicks.
By the Days when the song used to make you say
I'm day dreaming bout your love everyday and I must say that its on and its crazy...
Just forget about them other chicks
After we can make it hot so baby come on

That makes me feel the way you make me feel.
To let you know this is what I want
Baby let me know if you want me to be the one.
To let you know this is what I want
I ain't come here to play wit y'all.

Now he stay in some drama
Can't take him home to mama
Flirts with every girl that he meets how he would do that to me how he make it not matter
So charming and clever
Now I know that this ain't smart
But this is the best thing in a while that's ever happened to me
I don't care what other people say
Don't want him to go away
I'm hoping that he'll stay right here with me
Let's go now... now ladies...
Looking out for everybody else...
Cruising on the highway
The night went calmly
And made some arrangements
Someone that's replaced
That's when I call my girls up
You can miss me all you want
I'll call you in the morning
Tonight I'm having fun
Tonight I'm going out
That's right I'm gonna blow yeah

Security codes on everything
On vibrate so your phone don't ever ring
And another one he don't know about
I wish we could switch up the roles
And I could be that...
But when you call I never get back
Had a thing on the side
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy
I wish we could switch up the roles
And I could be that...
Front with your friends
Keep a straight face when you tell a lie
Always keep an airtight alibi
What he don't know won't break his heart
I wish we could switch up the roles
And I could be that...
Tell you I love you...
But when you call I never get back
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy
Told you I was with my crew
When I knew it was true
Walk a mile off in your shoes
Dose of your own medicine
You wouldn't like that
Had a thing on the side
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy
When I listen to the radio I feel like music is so different to what it used to be... and because of that I was inspired to do something different than that

The past four years in my life have truly been a journey...
Don't wanna be this way
But I'm hoping you can change
I trusted him with everything
Never held back anything
But suddenly he took his love away
I know I been holding back
But he really hurt me bad
I don't wanna take my past
Really hope you understand
I don't know what I'm gonna do
When I think of what he did to me
It makes it hard to fall in love
When I think about just what I need
It makes it hard to trust someone
Don't wanna miss out on love this time
Gotta leave those things behind
You call it ours send flowers
With love you keep me showered
You see what started out so simple
All flew out the window
There I go comparing you to him again
Baby you can be the the one for me
Yes the only one for me
And I don't want to lose a good thing no.
I know I been holding back
But he really hurt me bad
I don't wanna take my past
Really hope you understand
I don't know what I'm gonna do
When I think of what he did to me
It makes it hard to fall in love
When I think I find just what I need
It makes it hard to trust someone
Don't wanna miss out on love this time
Gotta leave those things behind
Too many mistakes in love I've made
I can't come with all this baggage
Thinking hes gonna have it
See I know I'm being selfish
But I gotta let it go
Faith in love is all it ever took
That's why I never gave up and I never gave in
I know I been holding back
But he really hurt me bad
I don't wanna take my past
Really hope you understand
I don't know what I'm gonna do
It makes it hard to fall in love
When I think I find just what I need
It makes it hard to trust someone
Don't wanna miss out on love this time
Gotta leave those things behind
I've been so many places
I've seen so many things
I've seen so many faces
Been called so many names
Kept getting into fights
Just for staying in my lane
Life's full of adversities
You're real when you can stay the same
And be the one that carries the hood on the shoulder
And I'm the CEO call me the owner
And I can do anything that I wanna
And I never thought that I'd rather be flying high
You can call me Hollywood
And tip my heart and see my home
Now tell me what you see
Now when I'm going home
Your screaming do your thing
Doing commercials now
I'm on the movie screen
And all my fans are going out to buy my magazine
Never though a million years I would blow up
Be the one that carries the hood on the shoulder
And I'm the CEO call me the owner
And I can do anything that I wanna
They said that I would try so hard to change my way
You could call me Hollywood
Cause in my heart I'm not the same
Now tell me what you see
Now tell me what you see
Because its time for you to live your life
I believe life's what you make it
Let me tell you about destiny
Its one thing I've lived by
Never though a million years I would blow up
Be the one that carries the hood on the shoulder
And I'm the CEO call me the owner
And I can do anything that I wanna
Now tell me what you see
Now tell me what you see
Now tell me what you see
Now tell me what you see
So I tried to prioritize
By deciding what I know is best for me.
You try to catch yourself before you hit the ground.
But nothings promised.
To give you strength and build you up when you are down.
So I set sail in motion
And I'm so glad it's over.
After all that I've been through
With someone who truly cares for me.
I'll accept the time I know God has for me.
One day I'll be the perfect wife.
And I won't be afraid to try
Though it's always...
Love that tries to trip you up
But nothings promised.
I'm not gonna give it up
Just because the last one let me down.
So I set sail in motion.
And I'm so glad it's over.
After all that I've been through
Taking care of my needs.
It's time to start living.
Can't be afraid of change.
Demand it till your satisfied.
You gotta live your dreams.
So let them know that you can stand up.
Learn to express you mind.
It's your life so don't you give up.
My life's moving forward.
And I'm so glad it's over.
After all that I've been through
After all that I've been through

I'm used to men approaching me
Drinks to diamond rings
Just then it came as a surprise
When I looked into your eyes
Never walked up to a guy
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna make you mine
Wanna play with you all night
So tell me what your name is
And I know I'm acting strange
Girls ain't supposed to talk this way
But I can't let you slip away
So tell me what your name is
I see you sitting all alone
And he said I don't have a girl at home
Just then it came as a surprise
When he looked into my eyes
Never walked up to a guy
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna make you mine
Wanna play with you all night
So tell me what your name is
And I know I'm acting strange
Girls ain't supposed to talk this way
But I can't let you slip away
So tell me what your name is
Tell me what your name
Tell me what your name is
Tell me what your name
Tell me what your name is
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna make you mine
Wanna play with you all night
So tell me what your name is
And I know I'm acting strange
Girls ain't supposed to talk this way
But I can't let you slip away
So tell me what your name is
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna make you mine
Wanna play with you all night
So tell me what your name is
And I know I'm acting strange
Girls ain't supposed to talk this way
But I can't let you slip away
Try to focus but my mind ain't right.
Something I did made my baby go away.
That I had on yesterday.
I need to talk to somebody.
Something I did made my baby go away.
That I had on yesterday.
I just don't remember.
From beginning to the end.
I kinda remember a kiss there.
That I had on yesterday.
I just don't remember.
You ain't go never love me
If you know he love ya
Tell the DJ play this song rite here
If you know he love ya
If you know he love ya
It don't matter if you by yourself
If you know he love ya
If that boy don't love you by now
If that boy don't love you by now
But I can't help this jealously
Without you by my side
I feel like I can't eat or sleep
Gotta come down to earth I don't
Gotta let you go but baby I don't wanna
I can't help but fantasize
Wondering what it might be like
You and I sound so right
But I'm a let it go tonight
Ain't gotta see you more than twice
Gotta come down to earth I don't
Gotta let you go but baby I don't wanna
If that boy don't love you by now
Now normally when I'm paper chasing

State troopers and interstates

She can do damage by herself
Ms. I don't need your paper

Let's go and I know that you see me.
Sit back relax enjoy the show.
Yeah I can hang and I think that why they call me...
Ooh they couldn't stop me if they wanted to
I can take to the floor and sit back...
Nasty girl keep on the low
Do a little trick and then I scrub the ground
Sit back relax enjoy the show. Yeah I can hang and I think that's why they call me...
Ooh they couldn't stop me if they wanted to
I can take to the floor and sit back...
So I can speak one more word of unique lines.
If he say he can beat me then obviously he lied.
Them other girls just ain't that hot.
Ooh they couldn't stop me if they wanted to
I can take to the floor and sit back...
If you make the traffic stop when you pop
If you work for your money
Blow his mind and you keep it hood
Like a real live woman should
Ooh they couldn't stop me if they wanted to
I can take to the floor and sit back...
While I was doing that you turned up your swag
You can try but you still can do it like me
I hate it when they talk about me
But I love it when they talk about me
Madder than a motherfucker
I can lie a bitch madder than motherfucker
Back up out my phantom
And tell you aunt for me I'm all wired up
Before I fell in love with you
Picking up the pieces of my heart
Fancy clothes and fancy cars
We go that far but turned to misery
I can do whenever or however you want
They love the way I ride it
They love the way I ride it
They love the way I ride it
They love the way I ride it
They love the way I ride it

More than just a girl
She always had big dreams
To see the whole world fall in love
And do what her heart believed
Everything ain't what it seems
I had to go through the things she went through
I now know what it means
I'm a bad motherfucker
A lot of these bitches
They came and they went
Please don't act like you ain't heard
You heard what I said
I'm a bad motherfucker
Know that you like that
Know that you like that
But I might just go with you tonight
Know that you like that
Know that you like that
But I might take a few shots for tonight
I might get messed up
But I might say I love you tonight
And I know what you want
Explore your private parts in a private place
But life is a deck of cards
And when the time's right
I might call up my friends
Hang out if that's how I feel
I might drop it low and pop a cartwheel
See me popping and popping
We got a drink so chill
Them chicks all right
Don't care what you say
Know that you like that
Know that you like that
When I'm sticking that ass out
When I'm sticking that ass out
Know that you like that
Know that you like that
It's not what it seems in the land of dreams
Don't worry your head just go to sleep
It doesn't matter how you feel
Life is just a Ferris wheel
It's always up and down
When you wake up the world will come around
When you wake up the world will come around
Its just the sweet weather and the peacock feathers
It's not what it seems in the land of dreams
Don't worry your head just go to sleep
When you wake up the world will come around
When you wake up the world will come around
Besides there's jelly beans everywhere
It's not what it seems in the land of dreams
Sweat dripping from my body
We both at this party
So come and show me your moves
I got some things I can teach too
Do what you need to do
It's about to get hot and heavy
You're getting close and the lights are off
Your body's in sync to the beat of my heart
And I can feel your nature rising while I wind on you
Let's dance like we're making love
If we're down just maybe
We dance like we're making babies
As soon as our song comes on
You wanna get crazy out on this floor
I hope you sure this is what you want
Cause once I'm turned on
You can't turn me off
You're getting close and the lights are off
Your body's in sync to the beat of my heart
And I can feel your nature rising while I wind on you
Let's dance like we're making love
Let's dance like we're making love
Let's dance like we're making love
Dance like no one's watching
Let's dance like we're making love
Let's dance like we're making love
I've got this feeling down
That I just can't lose
And the way I feel now I guess
I'll be with you till the end
I wish today it will rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Praying but I think I'm still an angel away
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got their guns out aiming at me
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start coming and I start rising
I bet you start loving me
As soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
As soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
As soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I love you but I won't be a fool for you
I mean I would stay if you could tell the truth
Is that your bitch over there giving me the ugly stare
I bet you start loving me
As soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
As soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
As soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start loving me as soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me as soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
All the way one hundred
I bet you start loving me
As soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
As soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
As soon as I start loving someone else
Give me love like never before
And it's been a while but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go
You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
Never knew what I was signing up for
Knew it was hard but not this hardcore
Wanna give you everything I never had
Love you and teach you good from bad
Build a life for you with my own two hands
Hush little baby don't you cry
And if you ever need a friend
And if you're feeling down or weak
There's nothing in this world that I wouldn't do
It all can get so out of control sometimes
Till you don't know how you're gonna stay alive
And this world can throw you over the track sometimes
Your friends can stab you in the back
Sometimes you just break down
It all can push you over the edge sometimes
Make you wanna jump off the ledge sometimes
Make you wanna stand up and scream
Make you feel like there is no one listening
This world can put a hole in your soul sometimes
Put you at the end of your road
Sometimes you just break down
I'll be there to stop the bleeding
I'll be there to start the healing
I will give you what you're needing
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I'm supposed to believe that
They're asking you if you're home
I weren't born yesterday
Can't get that over me
But I won't be a fool for you
Is that your bitch over there
Giving me the ugly stare
The one with the silicone ass and the Brazilian hair
Now you ain't really scared
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
There was never a day that I wouldn't say that
I took all I can take
If I know one day no one ever will love you
Tell me why I should stay
While you're lying straight to my face
I never wanna walk away
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
Gonna take to keep it
All the way one hundred
You won't get it till I'm gone away
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I'm singing this song
Cause now I have to find someone else
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
Somebody better than you
Somebody other than you
I bet you start loving me
I bet you start loving me
I bet you start loving me
I bet you start loving me
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you

I see a red door and I want it painted black
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes
I see a red door and I want it painted black
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky

With that rattle in your trunk

We like that knock you can hear up the block
With that rattle in your trunk

But spend my life with u
Nothing left but memories
The sacrifice has hurt my life
You don't know what you've done to me
You said you're sick of all these lies
This plan did not realize
That you got in mind baby
Was it worth to sacrifice
To break my promise of my life
You call me crying like a baby
You took my air to breath
No chance to deceive so why you're missing me

Drinks to diamond rings.

Never walked up to a guy.

I don't need a Lamborghini in the garage
Those things won't last forever
What I got is so much better
You and me on a summer night

I wanna celebrate and live my life
And it goes on and on and on
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
I wanna celebrate and live my life

Put your hands in the air

I wanna celebrate and live my life
I wonder how they sleep at night.
Just stop for a minute and
Got your shades on your eyes
And your heels so high
That you can't even have a good time
Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
We're paying with love tonight
Forget about the price tag
Forget about the price tag.
Money can't buy us happiness
If we all slow down and enjoy right now
Guarantee we'll be feeling alright
Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
We're paying with love tonight
Forget about the price tag
Forget about the price tag.
And take the cash back
Just give me six strings and a half stack

So we fight and sacrifice
So we ain't gonna stumble and fall
Waiting to see a sign of defeat
So we gonna keep everyone
So bring back the beat
And then everyone sing
Forget about the price tag
Forget about the price tag.
Forget about the price tag
Forget about the price tag.
Being the way that you are is enough
Everyone else but you
That's what makes you beautiful
Everyone else but you
That's what makes you beautiful
You don't know you're beautiful
Catching tear drops in my hands
Only silence as it's ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
And untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better
All my windows still are broken
But I'm standing on my feet
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
But I am closer to the clouds up here
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Don't care about the presents
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
I just want to keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the north pole for saint nick
I won't even stay up late
To hear those magic reindeer click
Holding on to me so tight
All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
And we can take it if you want
You got the whole world on a wrong
Time for us to make a sound
And the whole world's standing next to you
And the whole world's watching over you
But it won't always be that way
But it's closer than you think
Time for us to make a sound
And the whole world's standing next to you
And the whole world's watching over you
And we can take it as you want
You got the whole world on a wrong
Time for us to make a sound
And the whole world's standing next to you
And the whole world's watching over you
And the whole world's standing next to you
And the whole world's watching over you
All right All right I'll admit it
I like the way you rock it out You're like my first big break
You know I love what you're all about
You give them more then you take
You've got me thinking
There's a reason I never felt this Way about anyone before

California born and raised

Bright lights in the USA

Grew up in a suburb that was right outside of Sac Town
I can still feel it shake as I'm stuck in the back
In the middle of his friends while he drives too fast
This is the way we live
This is the way we live
They turned up dirt lot into a teenage memory
It's always a good time when we get together
This is the way we live
This is the way we live
I don't fit in with everyone my age
This is the way we live
This is the way we live
This is the way we live
With the backwards hat.
And these are my friends
And these are my friends
And these are my friends
And these are my friends
And these are my friends
And these are my friends
I'm stuck think about you
Then I saw your car driving by my street
Who's that girl in your passenger seat
Tell me why can't you see
Got your music up so loud
But you can't hear me
Now I'm walking on street like it's runaway
I'm on a mission like 007
Can't you see you're with the wrong girl baby
That girl should be me
That girl should be me
I gotta stop thinking about you
I'm stuck wishing I'm with you
Since I saw your car driving by my street
Who's that girl in your passenger seat
Tell me why can't you see
Got your music up so loud
But you can't hear me
Now I'm walking on street like it's runaway
I'm on a mission like 007
Can't you see you're with the wrong girl baby
That girl should be me
That girl should be me
I'm gonna make you see
But you can't hear me
That girl should be me
Now I'm walking on street like it's runaway
I'm on a mission like 007
Can't you see you're with the wrong girl baby
That girl should be me
That girl should be me
They try to change me
They try to package me but girl
I don't fit in that box
I see that look on your face
But girl I'm bout to wipe it off
I'm not wasting my energy
I'm not your puppet on a string
They try to change me
You're not gonna phase me
But you don't know my story
You wanna shape and mold me
I'm sorry you don't own me
I'm not gonna stop being who I am
Won't stop doing what I love
Say what you want about me
I'm not wasting my energy
I'm not your puppet on a string
They try to change me
You're not gonna phase me
I got the strength inside that's good for me
They try to change me
You're not gonna phase me
They try to change me
You're not gonna phase me
This renegade's not changing
The number of inches around your waist.
So many things you never show.
Baby you're more than your mistakes.
Don't have to do anything to earn it.
And realize you're worth it.
Scars will never hold you back.
So many things you never show.
Baby you're more than your mistakes.
Don't have to do anything to earn it.
And realize you're worth it.
Baby you're more than your mistakes.
Don't have to do anything to earn it.
And realize you're worth it.
I'm gone when I'm with you
But I'm better than ever
You just take it all away
You're acid rain in an endless drought
But you make it all okay
Take me to your place
You tell me it's okay
While you burn me alive
You just take it all away
You're acid rain in an endless drought
But you make it all okay
You tell me that you want me
But we both know that's not true
And I'll never be good enough for you
Think you're addicted to the chase
Think I'm addicted to the pain
And you play me like a game
I'm addicted to the pain
Cause you don't have a piece of me
And you're never gonna change
You are never gonna stay
No you're never gonna stay
You are never gonna stay
I sat alone in the cold
In my room that night
My face was red with the tears
Of a thousand and one lonely nights
And yet everything was alright
As I sat there in my loneliness
Wrapped my arms around my knees
I could feel my heart beat
I feel because I'm alive
Sometimes it's not easy to
And I don't want to feel
But if I close off and just be numb
I feel because I'm alive
Wanna feel every single thing
Our phone calls got shorter
And the nights they got longer
And I saw you with her
You tell me you miss me
I feel special for a second
But then you turn around and show me that you didn't meant it
And I bet that you don't remember leaving it
Maybe sometimes things just have to end
Maybe sometimes there's just no explaining it
But you could've let me know
You'd be moving on before Octobers gone
I heard all the rumors
I didn't want to believe it
You barely mentioned her once
I didn't think anything of it
Sitting there on my driveway
Said you could listen to me all night
Now you're the boy who never meant it
And you made it official with her
Maybe sometimes things just have to end
Maybe sometimes there's just no explaining it
But you could've let me know
You'd be moving on before Octobers gone
On that October night when I let you go
I didn't know that you could be so cold
Like the Minnesota snow
Somehow I always knew we'd end up this way
And I hope you feel happy someday
I just wanted you to open up to me
But now that's on the list of things you never did
Maybe sometimes things just have to end
Maybe sometimes there's just no explaining it
But you could've let me know
And for a couple seconds I don't think I can breathe
I know you love to keep me waiting
There's no way out of this
And you know exactly what you're doing
And you know I'm so done
But I can't let you go
You know you're so confusing
I should have already said goodbye
But just when I'm about to lose it
I tried to dodge this bullet
But you got me all figured out
There's no way out of this
And you know exactly what you're doing
But I can't let you go
You get a little closer to me while you push me away
You always leave me hanging when we make conversation
I know the things that you say to me
Mean absolutely nothing
There's no way out of this
And you know exactly what you're doing
But I can't let you go
It's three in the morning
And I've fallen so hard I can't get back up again
It's like I feel so much that I can't feel anything
I can't remember the last time everything was alright
I need some shelter from the storm inside
And life is so lonely but I am not alone
And that is the only thing I know for sure
So I fall to my knees
Tears falling down my cheeks
I can't believe you give it all up for me
And I will rest in your peace
You'll never let me fall
No you'll never let me fall
No I don't understand why this is in your plan
I know there's a reason
Something you're teaching me
And I will not give in this time
You will not abandon me
You have not forsaken me
You won't give me anything I can't handle
You will always set me free
So I fall to my knees
Tears falling down my cheeks
I can't believe you give it all up for me
And I will rest in your peace
You'll never let me fall
When I have nothing left to give
I will give it all to you
I will journey through the storm
I will walk through the fire
You are the strength in me
Lord you are the strength in me
So I fall to my knees
Tears falling down my cheeks
I can't believe you gave it all up for me
And I will rest in your peace
You'll never let me fall
No you'll never let me fall
And I will never walk alone
You are the strength in me
You pick me up before I fall
Always there when I call
You're with me through it all
The streetlights were gold
You were standing by my car
I jumped and you caught me
I'm hanging on your every word
And I can barely breathe
And your so tall when I'm next to you
I look up at you and try to hide a smile
You walk me to my door
I pictured this a million times before
I'm sitting on these stairs
But I can't see at all
Wish I could have this my way
But I know you can't stay
You stand there in my driveway
You're a red light on a highway
And I'm drowning in the sound of your name
Between late nights and mistakes
I can't stand in this earthquake
Here comes sunsets and heartbreak
Sunsets and heartbreak
Sitting in my car today
It's like nothing even happened yesterday
If you were here right next to me
I swear I could replay it all day long
When I sing that song
This little town is magic
It's making me feel things
I never thought I would
My name's in your phone every night
Wish we could just stay here
But I know it's not real
You stand there in my driveway
You're a red light on a highway
And I'm drowning in the sound of your name
Between late nights and mistakes
I can't stand in this earthquake
Here comes sunsets and heartbreak
I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna say goodbye
Maybe if I close my eyes
Maybe if I hold real tight
I won't have to say goodbye
You stand there in my driveway
You're a red light on a highway
Between late nights and mistakes
I can't stand in this earthquake
Here comes sunsets and heartbreak
Sunsets and heartbreak
Late nights and mistakes
Sunsets and heartbreak
I put on my jeans with the holes in the front
You in that plaid shirt could give me a heart attack
Thinking to myself this could be trouble but sometimes I like that
I can see my breath in this cold night air
You put your hood up you look so good that you know I can't help but stare
I danced across the parking lot
So nervous but I laughed it off
Now I can't stop looking at my phone just wanna see your name
When I close my eyes all I see
Is me right there in his front seat
His headlights pouring down my street
I try to forget but I can't lie
His words keep me up at night
If it's four thirty and I can't sleep
You don't have to guess
What's keeping me up at night
What's keeping me up at night
I love that you drove all the way out here just to get closer
Last night our phone call lasted for hours
Before I go in take a second just to breathe in this moment
Maybe I don't like your shoes
And you might think sometimes I'm rude
When I close my eyes all I see
Is me right there in his front seat
His headlights pouring down my street
I try to forget but I can't lie
His words keep me up at night
If it's four thirty and I can't sleep
You don't have to guess
What's keeping me up at night
What's keeping me up at night
I couldn't stop this if I tried
When all the streets whisper your name when I go by
When I close my eyes all I see
Is me right there in his front seat
His headlights pouring down my street
I try to forget but I can't lie
His words keep me up at night
If it's four thirty and I can't sleep
You don't have to guess
What's keeping me up at night
What's keeping me up at night
You're keeping me up at night
I let them get the best of me
Lying on the bathroom floor thinking there was nothing left in me
And there's a pain that comes when I look up and see that I am alone
My own struggle I am drowning in
And you should see the nights that I have lived through
The scars the screams the fights I let myself lose
But still the one thing I can't deny
Screaming in my veins
Is that life is worth living
I've still got a purpose
When I can't see the reasons
There's still something inside of me saying
It's only gonna make me better in the end
I'll take this broken heart
I'll pick it up every part
It's never too late to restart
But that won't change my mind
I won't let this take me down tonight
And I can make it through tonight
Even when it's killing me just to breathe
I know I can make it out of here
It's only gonna make me better in the end
I'll take this broken heart
I'll pick it up every part
It's never too late to restart
But that won't change my mind
I'll keep my voice strong
Even when it feels like there is nothing left in me
I won't let it get the best of me
Bow my head and say a prayer
Breathe in the words and say
It's only gonna make me better
I'll take this broken heart
I'll pick it up every part
It's never too late to restart
But that won't change my mind
Rub it in your skin like lotion
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted
Rub in it your skin like lotion
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted
Yes I'm about to go get lifted
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted
Yes I'm about to go get lifted
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted
Yes I'm about to go get lifted
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted
When I react on tracks I make necks snap with raw rap
Underrated too much but critics I don't follow that
You can't even dream of looking through my eyes
And be compared to the same guy
Cause how the fuck you gonna play this game
You took it far enough my turn erasing names
Now you falling off plus your peoples like domino
Classified saying same shit that he did back when
Well I'm pissed off and ain't getting no better
Motivate myself to keep the rest of y'all inspired
Looking for these individuals to verbally commit
Talk about experience but never played the part
Rappers entering this game biting like a vulture and saying fuck the culture
Talking image like that's how you portrayed
Now drop the eloquence I never had it in me
So pop the great white and let's have a drink or two
Never had no pressure in my life to push me
Staying focused on the topic at hand
I'm so sick with this microphone I feel ill
Like I got 30 different people wanting shit like I was retail
I'm done giving favors give back the pad and pencils
Cause you ain't got the heart or drive
You can talk what you want I'll emerge with a darker side
My marker glides covers wide spread
Bringing pleasure to these ears of these hip hop heads
Now fuck it Class bring it to everyone who is not dead
Set and stand out cut the band out
And let my hype man out
Deleting competition and still stand proud
Constructive over your head still productive
Got you hanging off my words class be seductive
Ya had enough kid relax and listen
First off ill make a few things clear
Don't be yapping in my ear bout some stupid shit ya hear
Take it from the source class no other
I'll bring it to your face to keep your mind from getting cluttered
Second to the people disrespecting
I'll cuss whoever wants to step to this essence
Now feel my presence in every sentence a message
That's my third problem never meant to lay it on ya
Looking at the large few still ain't seeing shit
Got me wondering what's the reason for my rhyme
And exercise my past days to see what things was relevant
Wonder if I'm dissing ya I'll tell ya if I do it
It's takes the best of men to overcome the rest of em
What happened to commitment dropping sequel after sequel
Was I the only one that wanted to finish what we started
Was I the only one that had the guts to work the hardest
Ain't really caring what ya do my glass will never shatter
My pockets ain't no fatter from yesterday
But at least I got paid dues all over my resume
I ain't the one to point my fingers at the man
Avoiding people holding back like it was laser tag
Feeling trapped like I'm stuck in this obstacle
People saying think straight but kid I can't think logical
Used to be about the money not the business
But times change so I modify the tactics
While others coming phony I'll be off can't control me
I ain't lying ask her what was her response
Did she say anything about activity on the lawn
Probably not cause your girl don't kiss and tell
I'm like the conscience that watches the steps you take
I'm like the teacher in this game that makes it levitate
Never once dropped my head and ran for cover
When I react on tracks I make necks snap with raw rap
Underrated too much but critics I don't follow that
You can't even dream of looking through my eyes
And be compared to the same guy
Cause how the fuck you gonna play this game
You took it far enough my turn erasing names
Now you falling off plus your peoples like domino
Classified saying same shit that he did back when
Well I'm pissed off and ain't getting no better
Motivate myself to keep the rest of y'all inspired
Looking for these individuals to verbally commit
Talk about experience but never played the part
Rappers entering this game biting like a vulture and saying fuck the culture
Talking image like that's how you portrayed
Now drop the eloquence I never had it in me
So pop the great white and let's have a drink or two
Never had no pressure in my life to push me
Staying focused on the topic at hand
I'm so sick with this microphone I feel ill
Like I got 30 different people wanting shit like I was retail
I'm done giving favors give back the pad and pencils
Cause you ain't got the heart or drive
You can talk what you want I'll emerge with a darker side
My marker glides covers wide spread
Bringing pleasure to these ears of these hip hop heads
Now fuck it Class bring it to everyone who is not dead
It's all about politics
It's all about politics in this game
Gotta make them know the last name
Or gotta have a steady back frame
Just to keep yourself up
In my position no one else will help me up
Maybe I had it up to hear with that
Y'all need to make this shit stop
Put away your gimmickry to act for Chris Rock
I'm sick of hearing rappers trying to spit with no effort
Y'all leave me disappointed like the 44 on the corner record
Ya need to recognize its steady politicking
Ever since day one I never rhymed for green
And never had nobody with their hand around my shoulder
This ain't a optic allusion stop the confusion
I'm white and I drop tight music
And either way when I started I lacked vision
Try to block this out your mind
See what happens when I'm bold to knock you out your prime
I ain't trying to tell nobody you ignore the rhyme
Way too many people saying put away the sampler
No more making threats
People in this game claim to be natures best
Got me stressed and I can't figure if I'm going to make it
Things about to hit the fan
Eh yo I straight spit on fake cliques
Make graces need braces
I bring it back to basics
When you continue talking shit
I represent a plus you a minus
I bust on these tracks with these raps and one liners
Five years to catch up
Seeing double vision both eyes barely open
Arms crossed caught up for a brief moment
It shouldn't matter if your white or if your black
If your dope then your dope
Breaking boards over backs
Of those who not trying
Checking every option
I sit calm and watch them
Making moves in the night
All I can remember was White Michael spitting
Mark Mirage spinning and Short Shane was drunk
Rest of it was blurry and kind of slip my mind
Now I'm feeling out of touch like I'm two steps behind
So I step through the house with my eyes wide open
Rolls up a joint with this left over Cuban
Winded and couldn't make it up there
It's real pathetic if you wanna think about it
Trying to figure what's going on
And as I finally made it to the 2nd floor
Out of breath still unsure what I'm checking for
Rooms are emptied like somebody just robbed em
Taking off with someone's Nintendo
Made a drink and took another look around there
3 o'clock their ain't nothing going down here
Now I'm trying to think why I'm still standing around here
Flipped off the neighbor in a pissed off behavior
As I run through these motions again and again
Trying to figure what's going on
But I will snap next with the raps that I record
Classics... ya average white folks
I ain't one to strike out
The only rapper who ain't nice
Ya can't deny my skills and ya can't deny I'm ill
Move and let this man out
I'm to reposes your brain
Cause the things you trying to do are burring out like a joint
With the cars and the cash running like they going out
And one things for sure... I ain't ya average MC
Ain't ya average rapper who grew up dealing drugs
I ain't the aver enemy to sucker punch and leave
So call me what you want I'll let the smoke clear
I'll be the same kid who drinks with authority and don't care
Don't sound like what's his name and so and so from down the block
Got so many people now a days who are full of it
Watch me do a full flip and I'll reverse it in the air
Make all commercial rappers in this game disappear
And I ain't ya average fan kid I've had enough of it
9 albums dropped and I can't play an instrumental a lot of people wanna say I'm cheap as fuck
I'll say what's on my mental
Trying to quit my job and make a living off my pencil
People like to open up their mouth
Since the first day my mom taught me how to read and write
I've been spreading my vocab to the land like Jesus Christ
I'll cut you off in the middle of your sentences
Running his mouth and putting shit in your ear
Stop with the gossip cause it ain't entertaining
Try to spread lies through the game
Say what you want I won't change
And you can believe me
And if I drop I'll return with the status that I left
Yeah this is a game and I'm glad their ain't a ref
Take fools for their money and their fake jewels
And I put in work more ways then one ask your lady
You still wanna talk acting like class is lazy
But I'll write through the night till my right hands hurting
Strike like lightning and kill all the nonsense
Son just be honest you never were a profit
Why you wanna rhyme like you deep now
I tried to listen but your putting me to sleep pal
Somethings are better unsaid
Your whole rhyme book is better left unread
And I ain't trying to turn this to a battle track
Running his mouth and putting shit in your ear
Stop with the gossip cause it ain't entertaining
Try to spread lies through the game
Say what you want I won't change
Taking care of business yeah without no doubt class
Running his mouth and putting shit in your ear
Stop with the gossip cause it ain't entertaining
Try to spread lies through the game
Say what you want I won't change
Drop beats for hype tracks smoke weed for nightcaps
Listen how we word it
Always underground but I rise to the surface
That's why all the girls them love we
And them whole an apology
Cause ya know we have the heavy artillery
I want a picture on my headstone
Sometimes I wanna while out and wanna let loose
Puff weed drink brews for an excuse
I'm in the wrong state of mind
All you flashy rappers talk and I'm here to take your shine
Take you props and make them mine
I see your temper rise and you wanna strike me down
I don't care who you know or if you push the hard million
That's why all the girls them love we
And them whole an apology
Cause ya know we have the heavy artillery
I know some rappers in the place really can't rock it
Listen as I take you through this
You repeat what you hear and expect a record deal
I see through ya and I'm finished with the small talk
That's why all the girls them love we
And them whole an apology
Cause ya know we have the heavy artillery
I'm a very bad daddy I am I am
I'm a nasty piece of work
I'm a terrible villain I am I am
In deep dark places I lurk
I'm a very bad daddy I am I am
I'm a nasty piece of work
I'm a terrible villain I am I am
In deep dark places I lurk
I'm a very bad daddy I am I am
I'm a nasty piece of work
I'm a terrible villain I am I am
In deep dark places I lurk
My attitude don't get the job done
I stand toe to toe and throw down blow for blow
Y'all people don't take me serious on wax
Buy myself a weapon and shoot till y'all learn a lesson
It's like everyone's a thug maybe I want apart of it
Tight grip with the heat packed beside my hip
There's a lot of money in this world where's my part of it
Stab you in the neck and fill your body with the check
And these are just a few things that I could do to you
Would of gotten that extra grant to shoot another video
And that's some real weak shit you build to my struggles
Someday I might snap and cause you a little trouble
I'm a very bad daddy I am I am
I'm a nasty piece of work
I'm a terrible villain I am I am
In deep dark places I lurk
I'm a very bad daddy I am I am
I'm a nasty piece of work
I'm a terrible villain I am I am
I'm the type of kid who wears jogging pants to your downtown scene
Stay comfortable with a pound of brown weed
Gas can in hand trying to blast Grand Canyons
I grew up in the sticks fighting hicks in my backyard
But I'm sick of doing shows in front of 25 fans
Nova Scotia kid putting majors to the test
Feel like laying ya to rest
But I calmed down and keep my head up
Doing this for class so fuck all the challengers
I let me frustrations out strictly through music
That's why I'm laid back when I talk all the time
But I'll smash you in the melon if you cross that line
Making heads turn till I hear something snap
Better recognize and try to analyze this
I thought I was the shit wearing acid wash jeans
Now I'm trying to take over this rap and rock scene
Testing all teams when I'm letting off steam
Never smoked weed all through senior high school.
Get up on the net and start bootlegging my own shit
Attack tracks with rap and stay focused
I played these strings as a kid
I play these strings like a violinist
Or a violent man whose life is finished
In it till the death of me
Till the bones are all that's left of me
Look and y'all see the remedy the authenticity
Eternally everlasting mapping out this craft till my last breath
You bury me with pharaoh in my casket
I mastered this massive maze avoid disaster
And came to my senses learning lessons to harass
I'm raised right night or daylight never got stage fright
And to my kids in the next life my minds on the biz
Y'all can classify the raps that I exhibit
We've dealt with the ups and downs
Some people choose to smile other choose to frown
We filled the foundation from the underground
Who spits and severs your words
To concerned to get the cheddar first
That's why you never get the perks
And now I cipher with some of the best rhyme writers
We've dealt with the ups and downs
Some people choose to smile other choose to frown
We filled the foundation from the underground
I'm not a newcomer I'm just new to y'all
We've dealt with the ups and downs
Some people choose to smile other choose to frown
We filled the foundation from the underground
Critics ridiculed my hits but dig it
I kill I will I'm in it to win it
End zone in my flow can leave your crew deceased
But check the news release
Can't stop the honorable
Fuck a pen and a pad cause now I write with tablets of stone
Now I've got love for somethings that I gotta confess
Got a lot of small talk that I'm putting to rest
Gotta beat guaranteed that'll snap ya neck
I got love for my weed and my unemployment checks
I got love for some things
That I never thought could happen
But anything could change
I got love for my people and everyone of my foes
And anyone in this game who keeps me fresh on my toes
You ain't built for the game I hit like rock bands
And with a small studio
And doing shows at the pavilion
I use to love getting taxed by the government
For the next year or so
So I got a year to blow
You gotta love a girl with class
And if you can't understand then go back and do the math
I ain't a conscious rapper but still state my views
I just gotta get my name out and continue to build
Now let me get this off my brain
I got love for some things
That I never thought could happen
But anything could change
I got love for my people and everyone of my foes
No guarantees but I take my chance
But we all know you safe like home plate
Class spit this rough like road rage
Wait for rotation on radio stations
And no you never lost your brain
Like every emcee just lost his sight
No guarantees but I take my chance
No guarantees but I take my chance
Same outlook never changed none
And some people act strange and dumb
Got heads in the back about to flip off
Don't talk or you might get your lip popped
Start shit like super bowl kickoff
Take time like I just stole your wrist watch
Made some mistakes and I never fade out
Class got this game of lock
No guarantees but I take my chance
It's so great when I wake up
Some kids hate and wanna show up at my club dates
Record executives who still got they spinal
Drop this for kids who wear they pants low in high school
Help me build up and live life comfortably
I'll remember everything that you've done for me
Clear out my brain and get props
Spit this for kids with a real love of hip hop
This is for the girls who got their man's back
Can appreciate a song that ain't a dance track
Yo I'll admit life is tricky
Drop this for kids who have a beer and are plastered
I drop this for painters and every street breaker
I got more important things to do
Then start shit and swing with you
I'll spit a verse off the top of the head
Can't afford lost time
Ya let's do a quick sound check
Ya just put on that beat I had
Still trying to show that classified is not a group
There ain't another way to put it
So let the confetti blow and get the show on the road
Now I made many decisions and made many mistakes
I walked on many lands
And swam in many lakes
I got props and pissed on
I was dissed by the system but I still tried to get on
My fourth album's the first record I really liked
Before that my flow was too hype and I really couldn't write
If it's the wrong way
But sit back and let the song play
Now understand what I say
Made some mistakes and I'll probably make more
Just how it happens when you try to go forward
And you'd wouldn't talk to me if I didn't have the beat you needed
Made bad decisions and now I suffer from it
It's just not something for Class
Like you ain't gone be happy till you puff on this fatty
I'm an addict for the marijuana
Doesn't matter if I wanna get high
We don't mean to be a problem
Somebody else got a problem
We don't mean to be a problem
Somebody else got a problem
I mix this like black magic
I got problems and bad habits
And we dope as fuck but no one's as broke as us
To make it in this game is a million to one
But I don't see a shrink and never take my prescription
Try not to get too drunk
Cause one time my girl talked shit and I smacked her up
This independent shit is kinda shady
Raw is the reason I sleep in on Tuesday
Greed would explain why there's weed in my suitcase
Confuse my notes whole with a rail road
Where the crazy folks all talk to ya
Be a carpenter like Jesus was
Young alcoholics like I need that buzz
I'm sorry father that I didn't get it together
I really just wanna be left alone
And certain people can't believe that I'm a decent person
Now take a walk with me
On a trip in through history
Where young girls learn how to be a dick tease
I went through all the same things you did
Everybody deals with the same situations
And everybody had confrontations
I remember all the stress I had
My grades wasn't good enough
Dates always stood me up
But as the world turns and we realize
That high school has no effect on real lives
It's high school shit
93 let me set the scene perfect
Young guy still shy around women
We agreed to let our sex life take shape
Made a plan and kept it between us
Still nervous as hell
But I was excited as well
Before I burned any L's
So I was hyper as hell
Date came at the party time for action
Walked down the road to be alone and make it happen
Only lasted for a minute and a half
But neither of us knew we just did it in a cemetery
Dead silence... Felt kinda awkward
But I got older and figured every recipe out
It's high school shit
I got the rhymes that sound so well
I got the rhymes that sound so well
We all got our taste but I still stood the test of time.
But I hate on everything I even hate most of my shit.
You can't make an album with 12 battle tracks
When your punchlines are whack
And you can't make hyenas laugh.
Separate the music from the gimmicks
Class Class Class Class Class
I'd always told I need a gimmick in this music business
Ain't nothing worse then when every person
We know that your flow is worthless
I can't believe that you people think your dues can be purchased
It's like burning your bridges and buying a mack pass
You seen all the gimmicks
It's time to turn the table
Yo when I was young I used to play these games pretend to dress up
So I don't put my image on... I live it
Kid with quick lip who opens you up on every visit
Every two weeks I was grounded
And that's why now I'm grounded
I got my head on straight
Now watch those moves you make
Trying to play us out like dummies
Son we just don't believe it
I'm just really trying to separate the music from the gimmicks
You seen all the gimmicks
It's time to turn the tables
Turn Turn The heat Up
Separate the music from the gimmicks
You can't take yourself too serious
Do that thing you guys were doing
Fill your cup up and chug
Roll a joint up and get fucked
Ready for a kitchen party
So let me tackle the beat and unravel the scene
Let you people know what you never travel to see
We got everything you wanna hear
I'm trying to shake these stereotypes
We got Universal Soul and Buck 65 and
We trying to blow like Halifax Explosion
Or maybe Anne Murray I know she's Nova Scotian
That's how we do it down here
Least that's how you think we do it down here
We all pile in the kitchen
Rhyme for a year think he's all Hip Hop
Well excuse me please Mr. 10 year veteran
It looks like the fame might be going to your head again
Not even in the slightest
Man you wouldn't write shit if it wasn't for me
Ain't Grateful for none of that shit
Why you think I never had money for that stuff
Cause you can't keep a job
You grew up with a silver spoon and never learned a lesson
Everything was handed to you
Money for only one boy
And that's me more skill more sick more ill
No bro let me tell them how it really is
I'm more ill more balanced more real and more talented
Okay enough with the singer man I thought you were a MC
You find what you good at and never ever change it
Still keep it fresh not the same old boring stuff
Everyday you call tho
Bro you're the sickest just give me a beat man come on
Some things never change
You a second rate rapper
But you only just started and already in your prime
Your only going down while I'm slowly going up
Bitch I've had it with your attitude
Your still gonna give me beats for free
And that's me more smart more skill more sick more ill
No bro let me tell them how it really is
I used to hitch hike everywhere man
Before anyone would pick me up
Like some people think Canada is only Toronto
Back on the grind now
Thought I was finished
I even bought a house
But don't get it twisted
Move out to the city life
With the family and minibike
This whole thing failed to amaze me
But lately everyone's gun is off safety
What happened to the culture
Breakers and the break beats
Never cared to make green
Turn this day job into a daydream
And now a day it's all changing
Now it's all a hustle
I flip flows you ain't tried yet
Make you expect the unexpected
Sit and get your mindset
And I'm a dying breed
Now I don't hate gangster rap
And never pay it back
But I gotta state the facts
That it's an entertainment purpose
Or the lines we snitch
We used to get props for the rhymes we spit
It's weird how pot heads like to brag about their problems
I'm taking time off the act and I gotta relax
It's been raining all week I hope it gets a little better
I used up what I want but you can take what's left
You know you got something saved for Wes
I got a ill concept hip hop
You know it's hard to be hip hop
Don't pay bills when you showcase skill
It's hard to be hip hop
You know it's hard to be hip hop
It's hard to be hip hop
You know it's hard to be hip hop
But we gotta be hip hop
And to the mass appeal watch how fast they fail
One minute you're whack and then your jam's official
Two bottles of cancer hit you
And then they loved him again
Then they degraded him
I could spend all day writing rhyme schemes
But now I got responsibilities
Yo it's hard to be hip hop
You know it's hard to be hip hop
It's hard to be hip hop
You know it's hard to be hip hop
But we gotta be hip hop
No this is not an illusion
No this is not an illusion
No this is not an illusion
No this is not an illusion
Cats are killing me Luke
Thinking life's like a video shoot
But I guess that's the damage the industry do
Still trying to rap with no fall back plan
Go all out fan you got nothing to lose
Yeah we gotta be hip hop it's all that we know
Get the drum track going
Yeah enough small talk
It's gotta be hip hop
You know it's hard to be hip hop
It's hard to be hip hop
You know it's hard to be hip hop
A little faster might be worth it
Take me somewhere else before I drop this back
Maybe later on I'll write some shit and put it down
Maybe later on I'll write some shit and put it down
Something like that yo
Now this is how the story all goes down
Got in the booth just to lay the shit down
And let the world know about this sound
Put in the work just to pay my bills
And everyday I struggle hard just to find
I know its hard to make it in the business
Do everything to get the best of this life
And I'm a take it one day at a time
And keep striving always to survive
And I can't wait to get you home to have some fun with me
I gotta let you know I'll always stand strong
Because the lessons that I learned at home
And I appreciate the love you gave
Because it taught me how to walk this way
Now ever since I took my wife's hand for my life span
I drop beats and spit bars and try to get established man
I need to keep it focused like a camera lens
But I handle everything from music to the management
They said music will influence the people who listen to it
Now I don't know where I should go
I know a couple emcees who think they better than me
You make it hard for a kid to love a culture these days
Now I don't know where I should go
I ain't ready for it. No
I never had to sell my soul like Bart Simpson did
Now I don't know where I should go
Or maybe go commercial... I don't know
Life's not what you take
It's not about the promises you make
Life is what you give
It's not about the stupid things you did
It's not about the way things could've been
Just think it's all what you make it
And you'll make it through
Ain't nothing changed
It's real life so we deal right but it feels like it's something strange
Cause some of the most successful people on this planet
Will kill themselves for somebody else's like they really couldn't manage
Life is what it brings
It's not about cars and fancy things
Girls don't lose no sleep
Life is all about the things you'll never figure out
It's all about the people you allow in and the memories that you keep
This here is life so tell me who choses what's wrong and right
That's how I was taught to be proper
Never thought anyone could get caught up
And slowly I grew up and the fairytale quickly vanished
And you learn to cope at the end of your rope anyway that you can with
It's your life. Just make sure you know what you want when you go out
Hold it there till the liquor flows out
And it slides down the back of your throat
But drink it every week for the intoxication
Hold it there till the liquor flows out
And it slides down the back of your throat
This is for the casual drinkers who don't know when to quit
For the underage kids wanna sip till they sick
For the ones who go to college to study abroad
Y'all fucked up like me
We only drink to get drunk
So what's up California
What's up Nova Scotia
Hold it there till the liquor flows out
Not a superstar and never wanted that
Smoked a lot of free weed from St. John's to BC
Ya I met a lot of rap stars that still a fan of me
But that's the way it goes when you get on the top
Let me talk to the women for a second
You see I know what I got and I know it don't get much better than that
Back in the day they never paid me much attention
But I guess what they say is true
See I always keep a real talk that's how I shake my sound.
So when my wife hear the track she might hate me now
It's a scoreless settle made me more than trouble
I told you before class ain't this appetite
Buts it's a fact in life
Gotta keep a happy wife
Its just sometimes I think I need the chance to live
But I'm a man so I glance and I soak it up
I see these girls on the street like damn
On tour I saw these girls on the road like damn
Yeah huh it feels good
Most the time things feel good you ain't supposed to do
Like I said I ain't perfect
Don't need a dick tease clothed on my TV
I love a girl with some curves and shape
Then I lose all control and think of my dick
I see this girl at the beach like damn
When we go to the club right Id see these girls and I'm like damn
I see these girls all the time like damn
I can't do a damn thing
As much as I see these days
I just hope she understands me
Some kids hate and wanna show up at my club dates
Record executives who still got they spinal
Drop this for kids who wear they pants low in high school
Help me build up and live life comfortably
I'll remember everything that you've done for me
Clear out my brain and get props
Spit this for kids with a real love of hip hop
This is for the girls who got their man's back
Can appreciate a song that ain't a dance track
Yo I'll admit life is tricky
Drop this for kids who have a beer and are plastered
I drop this for painters and every street breaker
I got more important things to do
Then start shit and swing with you
I'll spit a verse off the top of the head
Can't afford lost time
All I can do is watch while friends move out west
Kinda makes me feel like everyday I lose a step
I feel trapped and I gotta chew through the net
Had some great times and the memories never fade
But now it's time to move on and get that new job
And be happy for the friends that found true love
And that is the people that been there since day one
It's like I been gone without ever leaving
And now I finally see it
Disappeared for what seemed like ten light years
Your family you don't appreciate until you lose
You could say I live and learn
My friends show me love and I give it in return
A lot of things have changed though
Ever since I came home
Infield isn't all sunshine and rainbows
Not a superstar and never wanted that
Smoked a lot of free weed from St. John's to BC
Ya I met a lot of rap stars that still a fan of me
But that's the way it goes when you get on the top
When I react on tracks I make necks snap with raw rap
Underrated too much but critics I don't follow that
You can't even dream of looking through my eyes
And be compared to the same guy
Cause how the fuck you gonna play this game
You took it far enough my turn erasing names
Now you falling off plus your peoples like domino
Classified saying same shit that he did back when
Well I'm pissed off and ain't getting no better
Motivate myself to keep the rest of y'all inspired
Looking for these individuals to verbally commit
Talk about experience but never played the part
Rappers entering this game biting like a vulture and saying fuck the culture
Talking image like that's how you portrayed
Now drop the eloquence I never had it in me
So pop the great white and let's have a drink or two
Never had no pressure in my life to push me
Staying focused on the topic at hand
I'm so sick with this microphone I feel ill
Like I got 30 different people wanting shit like I was retail
I'm done giving favors give back the pad and pencils
Cause you ain't got the heart or drive
You can talk what you want I'll emerge with a darker side
My marker glides covers wide spread
Bringing pleasure to these ears of these hip hop heads
Now fuck it Class bring it to everyone who is not dead
But then what we had got fucked up
We grew along but in my heart I still love ya
Back at the start I thought it last so long
Everything I loved about you just got pissed away
The farthest thing from bitchy or heartless
You never thought less of a jobless pothead
And even though I couldn't get you cards or chocolate
You put up with my nonsense day after day
You were one of the type you don't let get away
Shit we used to looped together
Your mood was better than
But who would've knew what we had we would soon lose forever
I gotta say something on this one
The minute that talked I would listen
You made the way that I walk a little different
And I confess without you I feel a little depressed
I'm always talking and bringing you up
But it's gone too far cause you know it don't matter anyway
Now people come from the left and the right
And they try to get up on me
You try to fool me but then you catch the backhand
Then you jump my friends so now it's on again yeah
Recognize ain't a damn thing changed
But now it's back to business so check out what I brought
When they see me rise
Revenge is what I come back to prove
Or put it back on the block till I say its time to rock
Now you leave the stage cause you lost all your flow
Now it's time to hang loose
Life in a wreck here's a nickel on my bet
I'm down low and I need help from another
But when I take my leap
Life is a bitch and I'll sing it to my last breath
Here's my last one before I take my ride
You can't take yourself too serious
Do that thing you guys were doing
Fill your cup up and chug
Roll a joint up and get fucked
Ready for a kitchen party
So let me tackle the beat and unravel the scene
Let you people know what you never travel to see
We got everything you wanna hear
I'm trying to shake these stereotypes
We got Universal Soul and Buck 65 and
We trying to blow like Halifax Explosion
Or maybe Anne Murray I know she's Nova Scotian
That's how we do it down here
Least that's how you think we do it down here
We all pile in the kitchen
It's all about politics
It's all about politics in this game
Gotta make them know the last name
Or gotta have a steady back frame
Just to keep yourself up
In my position no one else will help me up
Maybe I had it up to hear with that
Y'all need to make this shit stop
Put away your gimmickry to act for Chris Rock
I'm sick of hearing rappers trying to spit with no effort
Y'all leave me disappointed like the 44 on the corner record
Ya need to recognize its steady politicking
Ever since day one I never rhymed for green
And never had nobody with their hand around my shoulder
This ain't a optic allusion stop the confusion
I'm white and I drop tight music
And either way when I started I lacked vision
Try to block this out your mind
See what happens when I'm bold to knock you out your prime
I ain't trying to tell nobody you ignore the rhyme
Drop beats for hype tracks smoke weed for nightcaps
Listen how we word it
Always underground but I rise to the surface
That's why all the girls them love we
And them whole an apology
Cause ya know we have the heavy artillery
I want a picture on my headstone
Sometimes I wanna while out and wanna let loose
Puff weed drink brews for an excuse
I'm in the wrong state of mind
All you flashy rappers talk and I'm here to take your shine
Take you props and make them mine
I see your temper rise and you wanna strike me down
I don't care who you know or if you push the hard million
That's why all the girls them love we
And them whole an apology
Cause ya know we have the heavy artillery
I know some rappers in the place really can't rock it
Listen as I take you through this
You repeat what you hear and expect a record deal
I see through ya and I'm finished with the small talk
That's why all the girls them love we
And them whole an apology
Cause ya know we have the heavy artillery
All I can remember was White Michael spitting
Mark Mirage spinning and Short Shane was drunk
Rest of it was blurry and kind of slip my mind
Now I'm feeling out of touch like I'm two steps behind
So I step through the house with my eyes wide open
Rolls up a joint with this left over Cuban
Winded and couldn't make it up there
It's real pathetic if you wanna think about it
Trying to figure what's going on
And as I finally made it to the 2nd floor
Out of breath still unsure what I'm checking for
Rooms are emptied like somebody just robbed em
Taking off with someone's Nintendo
Made a drink and took another look around there
3 o'clock their ain't nothing going down here
Now I'm trying to think why I'm still standing around here
Flipped off the neighbor in a pissed off behavior
As I run through these motions again and again
Trying to figure what's going on
Things about to hit the fan
Eh yo I straight spit on fake cliques
Make graces need braces
I bring it back to basics
When you continue talking shit
I represent a plus you a minus
I bust on these tracks with these raps and one liners
Five years to catch up
Seeing double vision both eyes barely open
Arms crossed caught up for a brief moment
It shouldn't matter if your white or if your black
If your dope then your dope
Breaking boards over backs
Of those who not trying
Checking every option
I sit calm and watch them
Making moves in the night
I'm taking time off the act and I gotta relax
It's been raining all week I hope it gets a little better
I used up what I want but you can take what's left
You know you got something saved for Wes
I got a ill concept hip hop
You know it's hard to be hip hop
Don't pay bills when you showcase skill
It's hard to be hip hop
You know it's hard to be hip hop
It's hard to be hip hop
You know it's hard to be hip hop
But we gotta be hip hop
And to the mass appeal watch how fast they fail
One minute you're whack and then your jam's official
Two bottles of cancer hit you
And then they loved him again
Then they degraded him
I could spend all day writing rhyme schemes
But now I got responsibilities
Yo it's hard to be hip hop
You know it's hard to be hip hop
It's hard to be hip hop
You know it's hard to be hip hop
But we gotta be hip hop
No this is not an illusion
No this is not an illusion
No this is not an illusion
No this is not an illusion
Cats are killing me Luke
Thinking life's like a video shoot
But I guess that's the damage the industry do
Still trying to rap with no fall back plan
Go all out fan you got nothing to lose
Yeah we gotta be hip hop it's all that we know
Get the drum track going
Yeah enough small talk
It's gotta be hip hop
You know it's hard to be hip hop
It's hard to be hip hop
You know it's hard to be hip hop
Uh... they call me Class the MC refresh the memory.
Whip the crowd to a frenzy.
I got a track record athletes would envy.
No need for jewels or a Bentley
I guess you could say I've been green sense this
Hemp weed hope them condemn me.
I don't wanna be a God damn rock star
All strung out and beaten down like a stock car.
I'll agree I'm a bit of a pessimist
Mad scientist mixed with the perfectionist.
I find this rap shit acts therapeutically
Without the hourly rate to abuse a beat and true
Indeed do whatever so beautifully ever since puberty
But never once musically.
Class they said I was going no where
But look I'm out here and ain't going nowhere.
Fingers in the crates still digging for the
Yo my head held high as I get in position
Real MC I fit the description what I'm spitting out
Needs no encryption. I am conditioned to vibe to the rhythm.
High trying to visualize.
Bushwhacked is back like Davey Crockett so
Shit I'm a problem honorably honest but all
Now what the fuck is the good of that.
I know you kill the beat like no one else but me
Literally the rhymes speak for themselves.
I never ran to the states trying to get signed for me
It was never get rich or die trying.
Broke tradition that made them go the distance
And if you don't think that I'm the coolest dude
And what's cool to me ain't cool to you.
Turn me up a little more... yeah... yeah...
I'm a scream at the top of my lungs.
Spit shit till it's off with the tongue.
Get lit ride off in the sun so don't trick cause you crawl
And I run shit it's already done.
Back with the flow the show the magic went from
Hat tricks to upping my status yup another classic
Hard to believe poker face on with a card up my sleeve.
They all said I never look the part but I'm not trying to
For my rookie card keep your mother fucking hands out the cookie jar.
Class is in session check the score card
Yes I work hard like male porn stars no the applause isn't
Necessary you dying to get into my show like a cemetery.
Fresh till we exit the door yeah we breaking in your ear drums
Ready or not here it comes.
Turn me up a little louder crank the amp to full power
We do it every night and all day.
So better get out the way
Yeah yeah yo last year I got new management
This year I needed new management I felt like
They never knew what manage meant.
Well good luck to them I just had to vent.
I spit what I live speak what I know set the roof on fire
Now you freezing in the cold.
Think that I'm paid nope I ain't loaded but this drink
Got me feeling pretty loaded.
Body overloaded bit of a beer belly broke bottles
Of booze can anybody help me.
It ain't cry for help but in hindsight I don't wanna live
The life I want my life. I
Been hoping I'll get by. s
Hit I ain't nothing outstanding from the underground
So of course I stay grounded.
Look at what we rose to from the middle of nowhere to the
Center of it all through the ups and the downs I'm remembering it all.
I take the good with the bad learn to be content with the things
That I have this whole world is fucked up and we all need more
And once we get it we'll find something else we need to reach for.
Dreams life work rights hate love northern lights.
I know life is good but I have my doubts
An ordinary child named after my grandpa
I'm the guy you thought would never make it in the group
When my hearing was an issue and they filled my ears with tubes
I never talked till I was three years old
I always seemed to be a couple years behind
Tell the story of my life in the middle of the night
We dropped a thousand feet in five seconds or less
But I never broke a bone in my body
I never had nobody sign my cast
Tell the story of my life in the middle of the night
I didn't know the joy that could come from my dirty thoughts
This ain't a song with a meaningful message
Tell the story of my life in the middle of the night
You better quit while you're ahead
A Big Mac with no lettuce and sauce
Now my collar bone is filled with stars and got stripes down the arm
We still got it after all the smoke clears
But half of these rappers are half of a beat backwards
I've dropped 12 albums with at least 12 songs in the last 12 years
Do the math right there
And that don't even count what I produced for other rappers
And that's only dating back to 2004
Let's not forget the other years that don't apply to
If the numbers add up you can't get rid of me
Beat makers want my voice on their instrumentals
Except I've never seen a record yet do better than mine
But all you gotta know is that he so Fresh Wes
Only rapper from Toronto on the Walk Of Fame
The most prolific rapper in the world that fits
36 albums underneath my belt
And ain't many that can deal with the heat that's felt
Rappers on the thing underneath my briefs and belt
Head stat on your cold toner
A known felon when it come to the microphone chrome
Wrote to it but never got it completed
I love the fell love the vibe that I acquired
Spit a couple lines but wasn't really inspired
See inspiration is the thing that keep my brain ticking
And started working on a new song
A track that I ain't feeling might inspire someone else's flow
I sold this beat to a guy named Phil
He said I motivated him to start pursuing music
But I never heard back and really never thought twice
So it didn't seem strange he didn't hit me back with something
Then I got another message with Phil's name in the subject line
I barely knew the guy but shit it hit me fairly quick
We all forget how much life should be admired
Sometimes we all forget how our music does inspire
Oh There's no reply at all
Now this is more than a business
Live this like it's an addiction
Spit this whether anybody listens
But these lyrics seem to be my therapy
My stress gets released till I feel at peace
And I feel pretty fortunate
Even though I never made a fortune yet
Incredible skill but no hype I spit it for the ones never heard
Oh There's no reply at all
Oh There's no reply at all
Roll the weed and put the stereo to ten
Take notes on how I stay dope
Upgrade the flow and keep the fake out
But I shoot to get high and go damn low
Now could I take attendance
When we create an event we did it all independent
Oh There's no reply at all
I know it's cliché but my DJ say
Always on the mind like priests with Jesus
Write my life like a thesis I break this down into pieces
Beat bang but still I speak
And spit with substance that will fill my needs
Treat hip hop like it's my religion
Oh There's no reply at all
Oh There's no reply at all
They call this Hip hop
If I was you I'd leave it alone
I kill you or suicide you
You had a choice before they flew inside you
I got coke in a hole with a nose like a basset hound
Lets put the track aside
I fuck with Classified
My motto is kill track or die
Your piece set it down
I done already touched more kids than a pedophile
Got my back against the wall
They call this hip hop
It's the game that pays me
But somehow lately the game's been crazy
So ya my momma made me but hip hop raised me
My favorite rap album ever
Lived it like religion
Critics call it modern day sorcery
To what rappers reported to me
And it changed the way I felt
Plus the way I raised myself
It never taught me shoot a gun
It taught me how to keep it real
And don't be scared of who I was
I've never been upstaged
You can write your verse good
Never was I poured on
Got my back against the wall
Well these are not just verbs that I recite
Its actually a verse of encouragement
And everything is perfectly worded
So I can make some currency
Just to service my life
I'm like a paycheck before you get fired
Got my back against the wall
They call this hip hop
It's the game that pays me
But somehow lately the game's been crazy
So ya my momma made me but hip hop raised me
I told this guy where I was from
From the land of the lost
Patriotic and a honor
With a hand on my heart
From the Greatest of Lakes
To the greenest of greens
To the Rockiest mountains
And everything in between
Humorous attitude like Kids in the Hall
It's the Great White North
Home of the funniest actors
The brunt of the joke
With an abundance of laughter
The Red and White flag
Keep it high keep it visual
People say Canada and get stereotypical
Think we finish every sentence with buddy or bye
Yeah we consider it people
And smoking marijuana
I know where I'm from and I told ya before
North of America hard to ignore
Every time I go away I tell them for sure
I've been around the globe and
Honestly a lot of y'all are ignorant and stupid
Unintelligent fuck we invented the telephone
And bred the greatest player's Gretzky to Crosby
We all got at least one drinking buddy
Our national mascot's a damn beaver
O Canada we love our beaver
The Underground Rail Road
Right here is where he calls home
Our health care system
Keep our girls banging with a full mouth of teeth
I won't even get into the music on the streets
They say hip hop is dead
I could do this all day it's a part of my routine
I know where I'm from and I told ya before
North of America hard to ignore
See I'm from Canada so sometimes the words come out of my mouth like this
Shit I'm a animal but tamer than a house cat
Cheese don't concern me but I'm caught up in this mouse trap
I always say that I'm a one man band
But I got more guys on stage than you can count on one hand
Won't break the bank but I'll break some bread
And I don't want to lose my hair but then I shave my head
And when the beat goes on
And when the beat goes on
Still got my values but switched up my etiquette
This industry don't come with benefits
I freeze time when I reach mine
And when the beat goes on
Used to think I didn't care what people said
Till I double checked message boards before I went to bed and
I always said this fame won't go to my head then
When they used to say they don't make music like they used to
And nowadays there ain't no record store to root through
Maybe it's me or possibly I got a screw loose
Might be your favorite now but hated in a day or so
Never liked metal but still prefer it to plastic
My dad says they don't make music like they used to
And my crew says they don't make beats like they used to
One man band all recorded on computer
Now have you ever thought about the old records we were proud to play
When that feeling is gone
Found out she had another man and this is when it really hit home
Fuck I lost everything I had and I ain't the type who likes to be alone
With his Les Paul Guitar and his call card.
And when you reach high sometimes you fall far.
His finger prints took a beat and almost fade away.
A couple show dates always coming home late
And when he was around it was like his mind wasn't
That's a one track mind
Got a one track I'm focused on important shit
Got a one track mind now I'm focused one focusing
Only wore clothes with a brand name
She got her hair and nails did almost everyday
Said she liked the attention that it sent away
And when she's done up right she likes everybody noticing
Looks for the praise lets the compliment soak in.
Without the accessories she don't feel presentable
She thinks everybody worries what she looks like.
Her own man's sick and tired so he took flight
She knows he loved her but he couldn't deal with Brooke's hype
She thought appearance was the only thing important
That's a one track mind
Got a one track I'm focused on important shit
Got a one track mind now I'm focused one focusing
Just give me some feel good music
I need something to cheer me up
Something to put a smile on my face
When the weather is cold and the adrenaline flows
I gotta keep the engine afloat
I figured that we've learned from the lessons of old
It ain't over till we meet up at the end of the road
A bit of patience can work as a friend or a foe
I've seen the sun come up today
It will probably change to rain or something
It's hard to keep a smile on my face sometimes
I know that we can find a way
To forget those little things that stop us
And push on through the rain and the sun will shine
Have a plan and know where your friends are
If you leave your town just to find your place
And run from things you find you can't escape
You can find what it is you see
I gotta hold on for one more day
I gotta hold on for one more day
I gotta hold on for one more day
Problems Houston but we are only human
But in time the anxiety will pass slow
Fuck it I'll be blunt
I'm sure we all thought about suicide once
I know I did but I never made the cut
I guess I never had the guts or wasn't selfish enough
We push on every day that's just how life is
Until things are looking up like gas prices
But once you hit the bottom it can only get better
I know that there will be a day
Or two that come as a surprise
I just know there's another way
To clear a path through all that stops you
I don't know what it is these days
I seem to spend them in a daze
I got plans that are hard to keep
I can find everything I need
I've seen the Eiffel Tower and all the Paris sites
And the picture is clear
Your whole team's played out like a pitcher's career
And yeah I do this rap thing but don't say that I sing
Try not to breath when we smell Seaweed
They say it's all negative but on with the show
And it doesn't make a difference if I got the means
All I need to succeed is jackpot in threes
Tomorrow I'll be here and I'll win back what I lost
One mixed in as the other one ends
Ears glued to the show and wait
Just in class or ironically with that Class kid
Out of class and back in school fast
And I barely get paid
Don't bother to write things down
My album hit the world wide web half completed
A few weeks prior to when I chose to release it
The boy genius reports all necessary features
Now I got more gadgets than a Japanese kid
Graffiti and it's the broken glass everywhere
And only seem to acknowledge it after I indulge in it
Then make a bowl of cereal to conquer my hunger
See I like to eat before I slumber
Jump in my bed and turn the TV back on
I wonder what the hell I'm gonna do for tomorrow
Bringing what you need plus all of the amenities
Not what you consider thee running the mill running the drill none of it's real celebrity
I don't let any of it get to me I am more mystery mentally and physically
Yeah I've seen the bright lights ever so vividly
Party with the star types and mingle with the industry
Flamboyant wannabe o so flashy if you ask me that really isn't classy
You'll never see me with my sunglasses on in the club dancing on the tables to my own song getting buzzed
And you never see me with a couple bottles of Chris trying to pick up on a chick
That ain't classy that ain't classy that ain't classy that ain't classy
Oh hey yo my daily insecurities got me locked down like I'm sitting in security
Getting locked down and it never did occurred to me it presented perfectly verbally
My certainties could turn into my currencies but you'll never see my shirt wide open
With the chest hair blowing in the wind I know it
You never see me loose it trying to justify my music
I'm just an average man who happen to have a plan
Never had to front on who I am to attract a fan
I don't waste for money I save my money return and pop bottles
Don't hate wait I ain't trying to say I'm trying to get paid
I'm trying to work earn the money I make that's classy
The radio's playing my song and I got a record label that's putting me on
That ain't classy that ain't classy that ain't classy that ain't classy
Yeah now I'm the one making many beats pumping in the trunk
I'm the one getting loose Friday night having fun
And I don't feel offended everyone can say their piece
I just really hate pretending so all you get is me that's classy
The radio's playing my song and I got a record label that's putting me on
If you're relating its hard not to hate them don't care what they're saying I ain't changing
That ain't classy that ain't classy that ain't classy that ain't classy
You want it you need it I got it
Been smoking for a couple years and got no plan to change it
At 21 I started puffing just in moderation
Now I smoke like I'm Jamaican it's a daily operation
Plus within my occupation it's an obligation
My parents always told me drugs are bad don't you ever take em
You'll be wasted and sedated talking sharp with God and Satan
Never hide it like a coke head its way too complicated
Puffing on a blunt go ahead try taking it
Rolling my weed another day goes by
I know what I need when I see the sun rise
I wanna believe I don't need to get high
I need to maintain my high
Rolling my weed another day goes by
I know what I need when I see the sun rise
I wanna believe I don't need to get high
When it comes to chronic smoke Canada we have the greatest
So it's hard for me to quit but I'm constantly contemplating
And my girls been complaining ever since her ovulating
Turned into her water breaking now she watches what she takes in
When I tried it though we grew together like a growing op
It's hard concentrating when I'm high song creating
Shit I'm indecisive when I'm weeded
Plus I feel my tonsil's aching think it's from the pot I take in
Rolling my weed another day goes by
I know what I need when I see the sun rise
I wanna believe I don't need to get high
I need to maintain my high
Rolling my weed another day goes by
I know what I need when I see the sun rise
I wanna believe I don't need to get high
But that's not unusual
But the way I'm feel it
No more running from the black cloud got it all mapped out
Put it in a figure 4 into a tap out
Still there some rather see me in a crack house
I'm on tent I'm gonna try and achieve it
The teacher said I will never get ahead
According to her I'll be dead before twenty
Welcome to Danger Bay
Where everybody acts up in the strangest ways
In this place when it pours
Ain't no love left only that hate remains
And in danger bay there ain't no heroes
It's a place where the athletes and entertainers
Are more valued then the doctors and educators
And they all lost faith in their lord
Welcome to danger bay
Welcome To Danger Bay
Welcome To Danger Bay
You better change directions or count your blessings
Then the earthquakes rumbled and the gods rained down as the winds and the hurricanes blew from the sea
The buildings crumbled and the fires spread while the wild tornadoes uprooted the trees
Welcome To Danger Bay
Welcome To Danger Bay
You better change directions or count your blessings
I need to unwind and loosen up
Lay back and chill out
And yeah I guess it is the weekend
And my boy wants to club hop
But I can barely stay awake
Plus I don't play the dating game
Get my lady in the mood
The world is running at a dangerous pace
I'm trying to slow down and walk this amazing race
Oh life is such a crazy place
Stay cool under pressure
Chill when the heat's on
Now can you hear the calmness of my voice
The coolness of my flow
When I choose to let it go
Everybody's too excited
But in the right amount of it
I'm trying to stay cool and calm
When we're living in express mode
And turn our shack into the penthouse
Canoe into the love boat
But without sunshine it's sunstroke
And all I need to get me there
Is water and a way to flow
If you ain't happy broke
You won't be happy rich
Don't spend your whole life unhappy
Loosen up your suit and tie
And your collar quick
Before you call it quits
Stay cool under pressure
Chill when the heat's on
And I don't need no stunner shades
I keep it cool like a rain shower
On a hot summer's day
Sweating in the running race
When it's hard for you to go on
Cause life's tough and life's fucked
And you bought to blow ya top through the roof
Take a breath and breathe man
Stay cool under pressure
Chill when the heat's on
With all all the bass
With all all the bass
With all all the bass
With all all the bass
Accelerate until the road ends
Show me anybody else this passionate
I give you my heart and soul
I give you my heart and soul
I give you my everything
I've never felt this way before
But don't say where you got the advice from
Never had to dis rappers
I give you my heart and soul
I give you my heart and soul
I give you my everything
I've never felt this way before
I've never felt this way before
I guess it's just a sign of the times
And keep your eyes wide open till the blinds recline
But my flow leaves slow from my soul
This passion controls me
I give you my everything
I've never felt this way before
I've never felt this way before
With all all the bass
Just give me that flute beat
Never needed much but papers and a few trees
I could have these floozies naked like a nude beach
I keep it fresh like the ocean and cool breeze
Chocolate and baby food on it and none of it comes out when I wash it
When your girl gets around like she just bought us drinks
And about to go berserk if I don't get this off my shoulders first
Stage and the ladies all scream like David Lee Roth
Hit the bus stop because we still got to flow more
This day doesn't die till...
This day doesn't die till...
This day doesn't die till...
This day doesn't die till...
This day doesn't die till...
This day doesn't die till...
This day doesn't die till...
This day doesn't die till...
This day doesn't die till...
Forgive. Forget. That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet
We try. We cry. But a day doesn't die till the sun is set
I guess it proves I still got a way to go
Got to stop being so hard headed and hard nosed
And I won't forgive or forget
But I don't want to live with regret
Try to forgive anybody who did Luke wrong
Forgive. Forget. That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet
We try. We cry. But a day doesn't die till the sun is set
I no longer talk or text message
Who left me stress and this neck tension
And who never paid any dues but expect pension
So that's what the friendship is suspended
And if you thought I'd forget guess again
I don't have it in me. I don't have the discipline
Burn me once then it's shame on you
If I let it happen twice than it's shame on me
Forgive. Forget. That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet
We try. We cry. But a day doesn't die till the sun is set
The day doesn't die...
The day doesn't die...
The day doesn't die...
The day doesn't die...
The day doesn't die...
Sometimes I think I'm a rebel
But I'm trying to be the bigger man and never sink to your level
Pricks comes and go every day that's life
And truth be told many other episodes occurred
But you ain't worth my time for a full verse
Forget. Forget. That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet
We try. We cry. But a day doesn't die till the sun is set
Forgive. Forget. That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet
Slow down I think I've seen it all I've been desensitized
And I dunno what drink I'm on
Doesn't really hit me no more
I've been at the same
And I dunno what drink I'm on
I've seen enough porn keep that window minimized
When I was a young guy I would chase your daughter
Man someone turn the TV down
It takes a whole lot to shock me now
I've been through the deep waters and the rocky grounds
And I dunno what drink I'm on
Doesn't really hit me no more
Now if there's one thing I love about being classified
I'm getting used to the smiles and the kindness
Never though I would fit in this environment
Back then I was my own worst enemy
Used to have a hard time handling the spotlight
But now I'm numb to it all like frost bite
I'm drifting off and I wanna rest my eyes
And I dunno what drink I'm on
Doesn't really hit me no more
I've been at the same
And I dunno what drink I'm on
I'd like to purpose a toast...
Intoxicate my soul for these goals and mad schemes
See my music's like a voice for my sins
Lose friends but gain many acquaintances
But I ain't even see it
I don't wanna deal with the hangover
I guess I gotta deal with the hangover
I've got the sweetest hangover
I don't want to get over...
I don't want to get over...
Now on the road to life
I mean life on the road...
It's hard to wake up every morning and get on the go
I love the job I chose
I just know my body's sore
And my driver's at the lobby doors
I just gotta get some rest before I shut it down
Tonight I'll take it easy
Till I realize how many people came to see me
I rock every show like this could be the last Class... act
Then I'll wake up next morning and I'll do it all again
I don't wanna deal with the hangover
I guess I gotta deal with the hangover
I've got the sweetest hangover
I don't want to get over...
Like you're 3 foot tall
When there's no one there to catch your fall
Been criticized and boxed out since I was a snot nosed kid
When I see the the light of day right away ill ride away
Like you're 3 foot tall
When there's no one there to catch your fall
Feeling like we built a team but ONLY I WEAR THE JERSEY yeah
I know this situations never perfect deal with what you got
These people are all over themselves and I ain't in to feeding no cockroach
When you feel alone play my song and that keeps us connected
When there's no one there to catch your fall
Like you're 3 foot tall
I broke the chains before they choked me out
Now I pay close attention
Really learn the code
I learned to read the map before I hit the road
But I'd rather lose a fight than miss the war
I've been lost in the rhythm and misinformed
I broke the chains before they choked me out
And I pay close attention
Really learn the code
I learned to read the map before I hit the road
Nobody's gonna hear a sound
I've been beaten and broken but I healed though
Forget the everyday stress for a minute
We bout to celebrate like we're in the 9th inning
I'm waiting on my pay day like I'm living in my heyday
If I keep going this way I need AA today
But I'm feeling good and it tastes great
Finally got paid not a day late
Some work all day in a job they hate
So that they could play all night anyplace they like
Whether its 9 to 5 I do it writing rhymes
I just gotta survive to get by
Till its pay day and it's pay day
I've been going all day all night all week
Trying to keep right but I stay left I ain't checking out
So I guess I gotta buy another outfit
And both kids roll out their own kicks
You either work it out before you cash it in
Whether its 9 to 5 I do it writing rhymes
I just gotta survive to get by
Till its pay day and it's pay day
I've been going all day all night all week
A little harm to the lungs and the liver
Under the sun with a blunt on the river
Play hard before I had a day job
Whether its 9 to 5 I do it writing rhymes
I just gotta survive to get by
Till its pay day and it's pay day
I've been going all day all night all week
Ain't no rest for the wicked
Ain't no rest for the wicked
Ain't no rest for the wicked
Gimme that classic bass line
I cannot be classified
I ain't commercial or underground
To afford a gentleman and females
We used to live for the moment
Now we tape it on our camera phones
And take it home and show our friends what they're missing
We're living in the new era
I'm back wearing these snap backs
Are out of shape and fitting whack
I call it how I see it
State the obvious like Twitter facts
I'm filling a position
Ain't no rest for the wicked
I'm coming from the land of the
But it gets harder when you stupid
At least that's what I think
So let me know when you go through it
But I gotta scramble with these vocals and samples before I'm trampled
To have a future in this industry is such a gamble
My battery is charged
But my cellphone signal is scattered
But all I hear is static
It's love hate and this game is in a rough state
Some kids hate and wanna show up at my club dates
Go and talk shit I'll shut you up with duct tape
Record executive who still got they spinal
Drop this for the kids who wore their pants low in high school
I'm send this out for everyone who runs with me
Help me build up and live life comfortably
I'll remember everything that you've done for me
So let me talk clear up my brain and give props
Spit this for kids with a real love for hip hop
Fuck all that blah blah blah blah same thing
And can appreciate a song that ain't a dance track
Yo I'll admit life is tricky
Drop this for kids who have a beer and are plastered
For anybody high drunk or sober
In the right mind so whenever pop mines
GO AHEAD this is for the ones I hung around with
GO AHEAD this is for the ones who kept me grounded
