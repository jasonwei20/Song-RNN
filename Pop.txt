Out of touch with reality
Because it's quantum not classical
You'll encounter infinity
Via paths we understand
Using Feynman diagrams
But now and then they go another way
Infinities will make you cry
And all other states of matter
Can be thought of as a field
But these infinities are real
Our results diverge no matter what we do...
Kiss your fields goodbye
What functional describes this
How to quantize I don't know
Now we need ten dimensions and I'll tell you why
Time and space and matter
I haven't slept in days
Haven't slept in days
It's been weeks I haven't shaved
And I got no time to bathe
But I'm gonna get an A
Tell me it's gonna be all right
Cause the graders gonna grade grade grade grade grade
And the students gonna slave slave slave slave slave
Baby I'm just gonna take take take take take
And complainers will complain plain plain plain plain
Baby I'm just gonna take take take take take
I'm cribbing off my sheet
Got papers to complete
And things are looking bleak
Things are looking bleak
I'm glancing at my notes
But I can't make out my prose
I don't know what I don't know
Don't know what I don't know
Forget these tiny cue cards
Tell me it's gonna be all right
And my straight edge isn't straight straight straight straight straight
Man I hate having to take take take take take
Brain trainers gonna train train train train train
And my brain is gonna strain strain strain strain strain
Baby I don't wanna take take take take take
Down and out about the style guides
And dirty multiple choice questions of the world
You could've been getting down
My exam's got another question
But there's no time left and
I'm just gonna skip it
To the fella over there
Procrastinators gonna pray pray pray pray pray
Baby I'm just gonna take take take take take
Invigilators gonna wait wait wait wait wait
And the slackers show up late late late late late
Baby I'm just gonna take take take take take
Some day I'll get a break break break break break
From this plainly awful fate fate fate fate fate
But for now I gotta take take take take take
Then my grade may not be great great great great great
But I'll finally escape scape scape scape scape
I got a lyrical proclivity
Special like relativity
General knack of physics
Incredible rap ability
I'm physically intimate yo
Cause physics is into me
Nerds from CERN to Hoboken
Gets your nose broken
Not hoping to make light
I know what high school life is like
When every bully is twice your height
Turning the pages fascinated up late nights
Leaving home as a hobbit you'll return as a king
Cause modern life is brain boxing and you're lord of the ring
Our name since junior high
We got pushed at the front of the class
But now we running banks pushing fat stacks of cash
Stayed calm built a dot com empire
So keep your pride with your face in the dirt
Sharper that any pencil
At the start of the term
That next to any text a nerd writes
That Hollywood gossip whoring
Is boring like a termite
From Shakespeare to Cape Fear
Engineers need a mention here
For turning tension and stress
Into a professional career
Yeah we've learned to be relentless
So whether you're a chemist
Inventor of medicines
Or a dental hygienist
Apprentice in theoretical dietetics of lettuce
You know the world has got a nerd fetish
So all my geeks in the closet living secretly
I see you sneaking nature docs on the BBC
I never got to be fly as a kid
But my vocabulary gave me sick rhymes to spit
Grew up to be a rhyme sayer
I'm pumping ions through this bilayer
Mind greater than a giant Ghana land snail
Rhymes get under your skin just like a hang nail
Wits make you dizzy better hold on to the handrail
So don't you try to limit me
Spitting back what you're giving me
What matters is understanding patterns and symmetry
So I'll be integrating your factual data lyrically
Bright like burning magnesium
Swallow you like amoebas
Enveloping paramecium
Fighters right in our element
Like a knight in Elysium
When we bridle the elements
Hell we make it look easy hon.
You'll blow your face off
Take a bow to the haters
You don't appreciate this high tone
If you made a scrambled egg tonight
There'd be no return to yolk and white
And when it's fried you
Can't turn it back to raw food
That is the arrow of entropic time
Structure decomposes till it's gone
Hot spots cool and entropy grows on
Now looks like Godzilla's been there
Stars explode and leaves turn brown and fall
That doesn't need to be true
Time symmetry precludes entropic time
Maybe this won't last very long
In that case it's probable we are
A brain without a jar
Decomposed in a moment
Who knows if that's true and I'll be gone
Though I can't disprove these answers
That there's a reason for entropic time
One must go right back to the start
The order from whence all things fell apart
All life hinges on the state that was
We hope to find its cause
But it's more than we know now
Birthing big bangs all over the place
That then disperse as
With their own direction of entropic time
That's what we'll see
That's what we'll see
I've searched for years
But they're out there
They'll see if I can show them the sines
Just a little cash guys
Don't fund this trash guys
Better face the facts
All you planet hunters at the bottom
You've got fact and fantasy entwined
Finding planets except they haven't got one
Well they gotta be forming readily
When you think about it given we've got nine
A blip in the spectrum
1 shift of meters per second
1 graph of period power
They laugh but I'm not sour
Cross and correlate it
All I gotta do is run
If only they'd look closer
Would they see a pure void
There's worlds galore
Too quick and precise
You're gonna love this find
Was something of a surprise
Especially given its star's proximity
Soon there'll be three
As planet pulls on its Sun
It shifts the stellar spectrum
Did it later undergo some strange migration
And too old to be so quick rotating
Is there any other good interpretation
This will certainly help with our funding
Got a surface of 1200 C
If in time this new breakthrough feels mundane
I've been telling you
This is no mean anomaly
We know its mass to be high
Half Jupiter by sine i
It's 15.61 parsecs from home
And it shakes our faith in how the planets are formed
And its star is in Pegasus
Give it an A and thus
Label the planet as b
But baby you're in luck cause
You got a planet finder never fails
You got the power of statistics now
You got a view without an atmosphere
So no more nights spent locked up in your tower
All you gotta do is wait right here
Kepler the planet searcher
We just measure brightness
Plot it out and that's transiting photometry
You got a planet there
When your stars do this
And your curves displace
Then your star's got this
You get good diameter data
And orbit distance from the length of year
Well now we need this tale supported by
We got 2000 planets certified
2000 more that only time will tell
And find out if we're really all alone
Is there a rocky world we've found no doubt
That orbits in the habitable zone
Kepler the planet searcher
There ain't never been a field
There ain't never been a field
Better than the field they call
I can show you a world
A shining shimmering planet
Found concealed in the band shifts
Of the closest star in sight
And I've found hope in the skies
And facing wonder I wonder
Could the sine wave discovered
Be a planet fit for life
A new fantastic point of blue
Placed in that narrow zone
Midway tween cold and steaming
Could there be waiting here
Evolving in this whole new world to view
Fathoming a whole new world to view
Indescribable feeling
Earthlings someday revealing
Through directly captured light
Don't just stare from afar
Though nigh impossible to see
Wouldn't close up be bolder
Next to its parent's flare
We'll know through atmosphere spectroscopy
Block the glare of the star
Chasing that crazy dream
Of walking in a whole new world with you
That's where we'll be
That's where we'll be
The paths have been crossed
The crumbs are gone and the way
Melancholy phantoms eye our skins
And poisoned apples falling with the wind
Hear the sigh of the trees
Those who enter here never leave
And the rangers stream
And maybe we don't want to be found
Maybe we don't want to be found
Further in and on we go
Sightless creatures tugging at our clothes
At the sound of the bells
They're pulling paper lanterns from their shelves
And the rangers stream
And maybe we don't want to be found
Maybe we don't want you tracking us down
Raising their muskets
Flashing their badges
But maybe we don't want to be found
Maybe we don't want to be found
They'll keep seeking but they won't find us
Let's keep living our quiet lives
And the rangers stream
And maybe we don't want to be found
Maybe we don't want you tracking us down
Raising their muskets
Flashing their badges
But maybe we don't want to be found
Your fingertips across my skin
The palm trees swaying in the wind
You sang me Spanish lullabies
The sweetest sadness in your eyes
I thought you'd want the same for me
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be
My back is turned on you
Almost lovers always do
We walked along a crowded street
You took my hand and danced with me
And when you left you kissed my lips
I thought you'd want the same for me
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be
My back is turned on you
Almost lovers always do
I cannot go to the ocean
I cannot drive the streets at night
I cannot wake up in the morning
Without you on my mind
So you're gone and I'm haunted
And I'll bet you are just fine
Did I make it that easy to walk
Right in and out of my life
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be
My back is turned on you
I look to you for saving but you're saving someone else.
I look to you for saving but you're saving someone else.
No one knows. no one knows.
You're watching a painting
They light up your eyes
You're watching a painting
The rush and the waiting
It all goes passing by
Yeah it all goes passing by
I was lost and found myself swimming in your mouth
I've got to plans for you and me
I swear upon this riverbed
I'll help you feel young again
A Hummingbird taking coffee with the ants
But we were one cell in the sea in the beginning
And what we're made of was all the same once
We're not that different after all
I've fallen from my nest so high above
Now saddled with a fear of heights
I'm praying you can set me right
But we were one cell in the sea in the beginning
And what we're made of was all the same once
We're not that different after all
We are tied in history
Connected like a family
We are tied in history
Connected like a family
But we were one cell in the sea in the beginning
And what we're made of was all the same
We're not that different
Running the race like a mouse in a cage
Forging ahead but I'm stuck in the bed that I made
But if you keep real close
I'm down to a whisper
In a daydream on a hill
Shut down to a whisper
But I'm so very tired
I've stopped trying to find any peace in my mind
But if you keep real close
I'm down to a whisper
In a daydream on a hill
Shut down to a whisper
To fade away and to forget
I'm down to a whisper
In a daydream on a hill
Shut down to a whisper
I'm down to a whisper
In a daydream on a hill
Shut down to a whisper
Counting out the signs we see
Fading in the distance
The two of us a perfect fit
Like an apple on a tree
Hiding out behind the leaves
I was difficult to reach
Like a shell upon a beach
Just another pretty piece
I was difficult to see
Rain against the windows
And the strong coffee
Warming up my fingers
In this fisherman's house
And brought me back down
Like an apple on a tree
Hiding out behind the leaves
I was difficult to reach
Like a shell upon a beach
Just another pretty piece
I was difficult to see
Like an apple on a tree
Hiding out behind the leaves
I was difficult to reach
Like a shell upon a beach
Just another pretty piece
I was difficult to see
Like an apple on a tree
Hiding out behind the leaves
I was difficult to reach
Like a shell upon a beach
Just another pretty piece
I was difficult to see
The paths have been crossed
The crumbs are gone and the way
Melancholy phantoms eye our skins
And poisoned apples falling with the wind
Hear the sigh of the trees
Those who enter here never leave
And the rangers stream
And maybe we don't want to be found
Maybe we don't want to be found
Further in and on we go
Sightless creatures tugging at our clothes
At the sound of the bells
They're pulling paper lanterns from their shelves
And the rangers stream
And maybe we don't want to be found
Maybe we don't want you tracking us down
Raising their muskets
Flashing their badges
But maybe we don't want to be found
Maybe we don't want to be found
They'll keep seeking but they won't find us
Let's keep living our quiet lives
And the rangers stream
And maybe we don't want to be found
Maybe we don't want you tracking us down
Raising their muskets
Flashing their badges
But maybe we don't want to be found
Your fingertips across my skin
The palm trees swaying in the wind
You sang me Spanish lullabies
The sweetest sadness in your eyes
I thought you'd want the same for me
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be
My back is turned on you

So you're gone and I'm haunted
And I'll bet you are just fine
Did I make it that easy to walk
Right in and out of my life
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be
My back is turned on you
It's one hundred and nine degrees
With walls as cold as a gallery
This is no place for me
Such hard faces set in smoke
The smell lingers in my clothes
It's a bad night to be alone
But that's the way it goes
Whenever life gets me down
Whenever you're not around
And you rest your bones
Somewhere far from my own
I thought I had it figured out
With a great big house
And green initials on the towels
I should be happy now
And you planted roots down by the sea
I saw you once on the street
Whenever life gets me down
Whenever you're not around
And you rest your bones
Somewhere far from my own
Just to put your mind at ease
You don't owe me anything
You paid me well in memories
Whenever life gets me down
Whenever you're not around
And you rest your bones
Somewhere far from my own
Don't know what to do anymore
I've lost the only love worth fighting for
And I'll drown in my tear storming sea
That would make you hurt like me
At the end of the tunnel
You may change your mind
Don't know if our fate's already sealed
This day's a spinning circus on a wheel
And I'm ill with the thought of your kiss
I've got no claim on you now
At the end of the tunnel
You may change your mind
I'll tear myself away
If that's what you need
There is nothing left to say
At the end of the tunnel
You may change your mind
Reduced to ashes and wine
You're such a great big liar
With the tallest tales
That I have ever heard
You set my soul on fire
Laughing in the corner
Right between the ribs
And watched the sailors going down
You've got my hands on wires
Right between the ribs
And watched the sailors going down
All the ships go down
All the ships go down
And watched the sailors going down
Rising like a dark knight
Traffic's slow with broken boats
I watched you disappear into the clouds
Swept away into another town
The world carries on without you
But nothing remains the same
I'll be lost without you
Until the last of days
The sun is in the east
Rising for the beasts
And I built myself a castle on the beach
Watching as it slid into the sea
The world carries on without you
But nothing remains the same
I'll be lost without you
Until the last of days
Until the last of days
Through wars and harvest moons
The world carries on without you
But nothing remains the same
And I'll be lost without you
Until the last of days
We stood so tall we caught a plane
By the wing and held it safe
Until we found it a place to land
We laid across the ocean wide
Bridged the gap in record time
The people traveled across and
Great in the eyes of someone
Great in the eyes of someone
We smiled so bright the sun went down
Rose above the maddening crowd
We lit the streets with the sweetest glow
We held the globe and made it turn
Wandered through the universe
The men of science observed through telescopes
Great in the eyes of someone
Great in the eyes of someone
He and I had something beautiful
I loved him so but I let him go
Shouldn't have to be experienced
I'm still reeling from the loss
Still a little bit delirious
But it's taking so long
And you are wonderful
You and I have something different
And I'm enjoying it cautiously
To get back to who I used to be
But it's taking so long
And you are wonderful
I am better where you are
I am better where you are
I only know that I belong
But it's taking so long
And you are wonderful
But it's taking so long
And you are wonderful
Stitch in your knitted brow
And you don't know how
You're gonna get it out
Crushed under heavy chest
Trying to catch your breath
But it always beats you by a step
Making the best of it
Playing the hand you get
You're not alone in this
There's hope for the hopeless
There's hope for the hopeless
Cold in the summer breeze
Like a willow bending with the storm
Running against the wind
Playing the cards you get
Something is bound to give
There's hope for the hopeless
There's hope for the hopeless
And onto borrowed time
And onto borrowed time
But you say you're getting tired
You're tired and so am I
When you fall I'll fall behind
And onto borrowed time
But you say you're getting tired
You're tired and so am I
Good with a spotlight
Planting the seeds of doubt in your mind
I'm fighting for keeping us together
I need to believe you
You say she's a friend
I've never been called the jealous kind
And you are the prize
I'm failing to see where I fit in
For three in two now is there
I need to believe you
Love sick only you can fix it
The panic's distracted
Love sick only you can fix it
The panic's distracted
Your fingertips across my skin
The palm trees swaying in the wind
You sang me Spanish lullabies
The sweetest sadness in your eyes
I thought you'd want the same for me
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be
My back is turned on you
Almost lovers always do
We walked along a crowded street
You took my hand and danced with me
And when you left you kissed my lips
I thought you'd want the same for me
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be
My back is turned on you
Almost lovers always do
I cannot go to the ocean
I cannot drive the streets at night
I cannot wake up in the morning
Without you on my mind
So you're gone and I'm haunted
And I'll bet you are just fine
Did I make it that easy to walk
Right in and out of my life
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be
My back is turned on you
Turn all the lights out
She'll sing you a song
If you take her to bed
The apple had the price of a snake
As soft as a door mouse
I'm as cold as a kitchen
In the breaking of dawn
I die before I'd leave
The apple had the price of a snake
Warm and brown beneath the sun
Just to show you what I'd done
Oh what I wouldn't do
Oh what I wouldn't do
But I would crawl upon your lap
And I'd die happily like that
Oh what I wouldn't do
Oh what I wouldn't do
And I will kiss you like a king
It was now and we were both in the same place
Didn't know how to say the words
With my heart ticking like a bomb in a birdcage
I left before someone got hurt
Cause it was what I wouldn't do
It was what I wouldn't do
I hang from every word
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high
How can a body contain something so great
My shell may suddenly burst out will come birds
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high
How to keep them high
How to keep them high
With dull knives and white hands
But you give me the electric twist
Picked from a hot grove
It drips down the sleeve
Gets under your nails
The smells of the city
They ride in your suit
But I don't think I want to
And the touch of your lips
But I don't think I want to
You might get away with it
One of us is gonna be here and
One of us is gonna be running
Off alone to the great unknown
With one hand off the side
We get farther away in the blink of an eye
And it's the time we waste
It's the time it takes to blow away
No one knows just how deep it goes
And all you need is a hunger to feed
With a heart full of mess and lore
We are doomed but we wanted more
It's the ride we take
The many winged escape
It's the bough we break to blow away
One of us is now retreating
You knocked me down so hard
I'm seeing a thousand stars
Come out where you are
And I will not be taken lying down
It's the time it takes to blow
It's the ride we take
The many winged escape
It's the bough we break to blow
It's the times we say
That no one's gonna take your place
It's a mistake to blow away
Touches stricken cold and clinical
What a transformation to behold
It's not the words that make it final
You've said such things before to rival them
But it's how you say them now that's changed
Cold but sympathetic all the same
You'd like to convince me that I'll be better off
So you go on and I'll be happier
You'll be gone and I'll be happier
Shoot me with your rubber bullets
I know you want the suffering to end
It's all to convince me that I'll be better off
So you go on and I'll be happier
You go on and I'll be happier
You'll be gone and I'll be happier
Is you'll be happier without me
You won't convince me that I'll be better off
So you go on and I'll be happier
You'll be gone and I'll be gone
You go on and I'll be happier
You go on and I'll be happier
You go on and I'll go on and I'll be happier
You go on and I'll be happier
You go on and I'll be happier
In parking lots and markets
Like a selfish daughter
Yet I wrote the words to the swan song
The author of the wrong
And I said what I said and I meant it
Now my dollars are crumbled in my pocket
When I wrote the words to the swan song
The author of the wrong
And I said what I said and I meant it
How could the world have turned so ugly
When I wrote the words to the swan song
The author of the wrong
And I said what I said and I meant it
You show up like a hurricane
The clock forgets to tick and I the same
I died the day you disappeared
So why would you be welcome here
Ride the wind that brought you back away
I cannot stop my rebel hands
From pulling out the pots and pans
I left you in the cold until you shook
You're gentle now but I recall
Both tender fire and bitter squall
A history so deep it hurts to look
If the sea should swallow up my house
I will turn the rooftop inside out
And the wind will be wailing
But I will be sailing faster
Oh the elements I do not fear
But I fall apart when you appear
Cause you are the greatest
The greatest disaster
If the sea should swallow up my house
I will turn the rooftop inside out
And the wind will be wailing
It must be written that the moon
Your house turned into paper cranes
We watched the wind blow them away
Some sorry comfort I was then
The weight of a mountain
The skin off your knees
From climbing up to me
They turned our skeletons to wood
And scattered matches underfoot
We must walk carefully in place
The circles darken round our eyes
They gleam like diamonds in a cave
The weight of a mountain
The skin off your knees
From climbing back to me
Keep the world without
Only the two of us count
They try to tear us down
We'll find our way again
Now eternally sleeps by his side
What is worth living for is worth a fight
They can't hurt us now
You came with the season as the first swallow sang
We planted our kisses where the wild berries grow
My feet sprouted wings and I flew all the way home
My cheeks red like fire engines racing straight to the heat of your skin
And I know our days are numbered early bird of the summer
You'll fly south just as the fall begins
The leaves changed their colors and the schoolyards were filled
My coat with the patches barely keeps out the chill
You sent me a postcard from a town out of state
I wish it were warmer and I hope you're the same
I was wrong to try and capture you
I met someone walking at a park by the lake
He don't fly like we did but he don't fly away
Gone is the pale hand of winter
Here is the first flush of May
And soon I will discover whether birds of the summer
We are not frightened anymore
Blame a change of mind
A seismic shift in times
They told us not to fight
But we'll fight it till we die
And so they sunk every ship we sailed
And they fought hard but somewhere fighting failed
Steel and concrete break
Beneath the steady waves
Of fearless hope and grace
In kindness there is strength
You say your time has come
You're tired of waking up
I can't conceive of living without you
You say you drag me down
No one should want you now
When I start to cry you kiss my eyes
And say I'm not allowed to
Burning beacon in the night
Can't feel its heat or see its light
That single solitary guide
It must get lonely there sometimes
You were a child forgot
Lessons of love untaught
Now no embrace can quite replace
The one that never found you
I was raised tenderly
All that was taught to me
But they didn't know how to
Burning beacon in the night
Can't feel its heat or see its light
That single solitary guide
It must get lonely there sometimes
Let me stand by you loneliest light
Burning beacon in the night
Can't feel its heat or see its light
That single solitary guide
This day is stifling.
You're sprawled out like a king
Possessed of idle mind
This calm is a false friend.
Something is changing me
Real slow from the inside out.
The cause is the cure now.
We fought a silent war in a hardware store
And the air was thick as paint
Though I carried it on I knew that I was wrong
But I fight when I'm afraid
And bangs my ribs to pieces.
Thoughts are the safe bet.
We fought a silent war in a hardware store
And the air was thick as paint
Though I carried it on I knew that I was wrong
But I fight when I'm afraid
A lesser man would be afraid.
And how you brought me down
With the sound of the shaming as you went out.
The cause is the cure now
We fought a silent war in a hardware store
And the air was thick as paint
Though I carried it on I knew that I was wrong
But I fight when I'm afraid
A lesser man would break free
They come in at the sun
Just to see what would happen
Falling forwards and backwards
Of all these converts
We seem to even be missing the start
No one else but you and me have a say
We're coming... We're coming around
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
And when those blue snowflakes start falling
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the bird
Walking in a winter wonderland
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
But you can do the job
As we dream by the fire
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the all the kids knock him down
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
There's snow on the bench
There's snow on the sleeping grave
And the crooked fence
And if you've been crying
With my hand on my chest
I swear I'll never tell
The town is aglow with lights
Your sister won't sleep tonight
For the morning brings
That old happy Christmas
You came here to find it
For joy doesn't come in boxes
Nor peace in a heavy watch
Those red ribbon foxes are not so easy caught
But the search it never stops
The son of a holy man
You dream of the saints
So thin with your poet hands
And your eyes of flame
And I'd like to kiss you
I don't care if you tell
For love doesn't come in boxes
Nor truth in a crowded shop
Those red ribbon foxes are not so easy caught
But the search it never stops
For faith doesn't come in boxes
Nor God in your silver cross
Those red ribbon foxes are not so easy caught
But the search goes on and on
The smoke of memories in my eyes
The room is sleeting kind
It comes in winter white
Dismiss the urge to reminisce
To miss your stupid kiss
The shot at happiness
And I don't care if it did
And there's no turning back
Happy goddamn new year
I see you everywhere I breathe
You are the devil king
The hell of my dreams
You're poisoning my sleep
There's no turning back
And this year it's going to be
Just like you never knew me
How I love to be alone
You're a million miles away this Christmas
You're a million miles away from home
I haven't heard you call me sister
I haven't heard it said in years
But it's a funny thing now it's the only thing I want to hear
For I don't know you anymore
I want to wish you well
Our family was never perfect
You did your best to tear it down
Well everybody made mistakes
I understand that you are angry
But I don't know what to make of you
When I don't know you anymore
I want to wish you well
I want to wish you well
Now do you sit by your plastic tree
And tell your friends you've no family
I want to wish you well
I want to wish you well
I want to wish you well
I want to wish you well
Christmas time is here
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of the year
Snowflakes in the air
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share
Sleigh bells in the air
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there
Christmas time is here
We'll be drawing near
Such spirit through the year
Such spirit through the year...
Christmas time is here
The time has come for giving up
I wanted once to become what
Through the fields of graves
Roaming through my veins
And all is full of smoke
Their faint white heat
Through the fields of graves
Roaming through my veins
Hanging heavy up above
Drown in the drowsy afternoon
In the green grass where yellow flowers bloom
And eyes will close... They'll close
That tight grasp won't save you any pain
Rock back and forwards with your breath
Let the winds of wander blow
Where the winds of wander blow
We found ourselves atop of a mountain peak
The air was thin as a beggar's sleeve
The city lights were miles away
The hush was as thick as your winter coat
And you wrote our names in the morning
Snow with fallen twigs and berries saved
Tucked up in my snowy branches
The sun is overhead and you lift your face
Up to the sky and you sing this place
The sweetest song it's ever known
Then slowly the deer and the rabbits crept
Their great big teeth and their claws
Don't be scared of avalanches
And look how well the gray wolf dances
You bring light and second chances
Don't be scared of avalanches
Don't be scared of avalanches
Don't be scared of avalanches
I laid down by the river's edge
I laid down wondering where it led
I laid down by the river's edge
And I woke up in a river bed
There were flowers in my hair
River flowers floating everywhere
And all the fishes came and kissed my feet
But we are not yet what you want
You've got to find where you belong
Not a needle left on a branch
But the fish were gone
I know they heard me cry
So I went on at the river's pace
But we are not yet what you want
You've got to find where you belong
You cannot catch the river though
It makes you think you can
It trickles through your fingers
While you hold it in your hands
It was a dark and clouded night
Where neither star nor moon would shine
Yet standing in a pool of light
Like Saturn with its rings
A lonesome figure gleamed
So tall and wild and evergreen
With roots that reached out for the sea
Like dancers in the wind
Those salt cliffs can't be scaled
The evidence of those who failed
Their skeletons lay strange and frail
Like lace among the rocks
So content to sit and wait
So dedicated to your fate
You just stand up there and watch
I wish that you would
Got lost in your magic
Spent my life waiting
For a sight of the sea
Been sitting beside it
If you wanted my love then
Dawn breaks on the cool waves
See the bright face of a new day
And the darkness fades
And the darkness fades
And the darkness fades
And the darkness fades away
Salt taste and the dolphins play games
And the sea birds race
As the old flag is raised
And the darkness fades
And the darkness fades
And the darkness fades
And the darkness fades away
And the weight of the world is lost
And the blues in the blue we cross
Everything gone is gone
Good man with the capable hands
That you can't go back
No you can't look back
Sea is always changing
Rains came without warning
Vessel once so mighty
Down down down how I miss you now
Down down down how I miss you now
Life without a witness
Wish it were a bad dream
Awful free for a stranger
There's a wolf here among the sheep
But marching along to the spirit catcher's song
You remain in a dreamless sleep
Let the counterfeit suffice
They will be kind to you
Fog and fears and a mouth full of hot tears
Can drown that voice sent to guide you
And wicked tongues with their hooks
Can wake the demons inside you
Doubt will creep through the windows as you sleep
Setting in like a cold cold front
Your hands go numb and your stomach doubles up
Hold the counterfeit so tight
Never say never say never
For you never know where you're going to go
Loosen the deathly grip
You can't be tethered to a ghost
There is something about you
I don't know anything
Any much of anything about this here
It is uncharted territory
But you're not there to run to
To know somebody like you
Exists makes it all right to
Forget what I left behind
Because I like you like you like
Do you hear that sound
It's the sound of the lost gone found
It's the sound of a mute gone loud
It's the sound of a new start
With a mouth of shooting stars
All the lost and the broken parts
Unafraid you can name your scars
With a touch of a new heart
And it goes with where you go
You are right as you are
In the air there is a
River wide and boulders on my path
And it broke my heart
Turned into a forest in my tracks
Things grow towards the light
Looking to find what they are looking for
And grasses grow high
In pursuit of the sky
Like those who've come before
Sometimes you've got to fight for all you're worth
Is how to let yourself be still
Staying doesn't always have to hurt
Things grow towards the light
Looking to find what they are looking for
Looking for something more
Let your breath fill the empty space
Where you used to keep the dead dead weight
Where you stand is where you belong
The place you've been looking for all along
Let your breath fill the empty space
Fill you up like a warm embrace
Where you stand is where you belong
Let your breath fill the empty space
Let it fill you up till you fly away
Where you stand is where you belong
The place you've been looking for all along
Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
But when you put your arms around me
I get a feeling that's hard to bear
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever all through the night
Sun lights up the day time
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever all through the night
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever Started long ago
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
Fever with thy flaming youth
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
Fever when he holds me tight
Daddy won't you treat him right
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Fever if you live and learn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
As long as you love me so
Love of mine some day you will die
But I'll be close behind
I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight
Waiting for the hint of a spark
If Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark
In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me
If Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark
You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary
And the soles of your shoes are all worn down
The time for sleep is now
It's nothing to cry about
In the blackest of rooms
If Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the No's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark
There's a girl in the tree top looking at the stars
Searching for the answer buried in his heart
If there's a meaning can you show me a sign
The more I look it just gets harder to find
If there's a meaning can you show me a sign
The more I look it just gets harder to find
And maybe we will never figure it out
I'm learning anything is possible now
Just like in a movie scene.
I'm falling in love again.
And I'm changing my name to a word that's really hard to say.
And it ruined my holiday.
I'm falling in love again
I just gotta believe there's something better.
I just gotta believe there's something more than you and me.
I felt like a kid again.
I'm falling in love again.
I just gotta believe there's something better.
I just gotta believe there's something more than you and me.
You say love is what you put into it
You say that I'm losing my will
You make up a half of the whole
You say that it's hard to commit to it
You say that it's hard standing still
Don't you know that I spend all my nights
If only New York wasn't so far away
I promise the city won't get in our way
Just know that I'm already home
I say that we're right in the heart of it
A love only we understand
I will bend every light in this city
And make sure they're shining on you
If only New York wasn't so far away
I promise the city won't get in our way
Just know that I'm already home
When life takes its own course
Sometimes we just don't get to choose
I'd rather be there next to you
All I have is this feeling inside of me
The only thing I've ever known
If only New York wasn't so far away
I promise the city won't get in our way
Just know that I'm already home
If only New York wasn't so far away
I will be there every step of the way
Just know that I'm already home
I say we chuck inhibitions
And sell our souls to rock and roll
I need to know what I'm missing
So turn it up on the stereo
Somebody light the ignition
It's time to make a decision
I'm feeling the world go round
It's spinning me upside down
I'm finally homeward bound
It's crawling under my skin
And I don't care if I sin
I really want it right now
I really want it right now
If there's a maker up above
Then why is nobody listening
It's not about your religion
Just take a look in the mirror
It couldn't be any clearer
I'm feeling the world go round
It's spinning me upside down
I'm finally homeward bound
It's crawling under my skin
And I don't care if I sin
I really want it right now
I really want it right now
I say we chuck inhibitions
I'm feeling the world go round
It's spinning me upside down
I'm finally homeward bound
It's crawling under my skin
And I don't care if I sin
I really want it right now
And I am feeling so small
I know nothing at all
And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye
And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
I will always be there
And I will always be there
When you need it the most
And all you've got is a prayer
If you're gay then you're gay
Don't pretend that you're straight
You can be who you are any day of the week
You are unlike the others
If you're straight well that's great
You can help procreate
And make gay little babies
For the whole human race
Make a world we can live in
Where the one who you love's not an issue
And we're all just looking for love to change the world
We can't keep running away from who we are
If you're gay then you're gay
If you're straight well that's great
If you fall in between that's the best way to be
You've got so many options
Every fish in the sea wants to kiss you
And we're all just looking for love to change the world
We can't keep running away from who we are
And we're all here in it together
We're one step closer to breaking down the walls
I am just a sailor in a great big sea
Searching for what's meant for me
And I thank my lucky stars every single day
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be
When the storm begins to blow
When I've lost my way back home
There is a ripple to every wave
A rhythm to the days and nights
All our efforts multiply
One small step is all we need
There is no difference between you and me
It lies beyond our history
And if we only take the time to see we're all we need
Love exists in every kind
I lived in every word you said
The stars had aligned
I thought that I found you
And I don't wanna love somebody else
And now it's screaming in my head
And one day we could start again
Well I don't care if loneliness kills me
I don't wanna love somebody else
I know that it's time to tell you it's over
Another year you made a promise
Another chance to turn it all around
And do not save this for tomorrow
Embrace the past and you can live for now
And I will give the world to you
Speak louder than the words before you
And give them meaning no one else has found
The role we play is so important
We are the voices of the underground
And I would give the world to you
Say everything you've always wanted
Be not afraid of who you really are
Cause in the end we have each other
And that's at least one thing worth living for
And I would give the world to you
A million suns that shine upon me
A million eyes you are the brightest blue
Lets tear the walls down that divide us
And build a statue strong enough for two
I pass it back to you
And I would give the world
And I would give the world to you
You are the brightest
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait till the sun don't shine
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait till your life goes by
When your heart don't feel like dancing
I'll be there to give you mine
When you lose that happy feeling
I will lift your spirits high
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait till the sun don't shine
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait till your life goes by
All those people who have hurt you
They ain't worth your precious time
When there's no one you can turn to
I'll be right there by your side
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait till the sun don't shine
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait till your life goes by
Take that weight off of your shoulders
You can rest your head on mine
When you feel like starting over
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait till the sun don't shine
Shorty don't wait in line
It's a great big world and there's no need to cry.
And my best friend said he came from the sky.
You're a special part of one bring grand design.
13 billion years and there's still time.
It's a great big world and there's no need to cry.
And I am feeling so small
I know nothing at all
And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye
And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
You're just a name that I have learned
Another way for me to turn
And you brought me here
And it took years for me to find
That you were only in my mind
I've been looking in the wrong place
Couldn't see what I've always known
I was facing the wrong way
I don't care what they all say
Let me find my own way home
I don't care if my heart breaks
You're just a name that I hold close
There when I needed you the most
And you brought me here
Where I can learn to love myself
Without the love of someone else
I've been looking in the wrong place
Couldn't see what I've always known
I was facing the wrong way
I don't care what they all say
Let me find my own way home
I don't care if my heart breaks
I don't care what they all say
I don't care if my heart breaks
I don't care if my heart breaks
I don't care if my heart breaks
I've been looking in the wrong place
Couldn't see what I've always known
I was facing the wrong way
I don't care what they all say
Let me find my own way home
I don't care if my heart breaks
I don't care if my heart breaks
You're like the thing that makes the universe explode
You're my kaleidoscope
You're my kaleidoscope
It all looks better when I see it with you here
You're my kaleidoscope
You're my kaleidoscope
You're my kaleidoscope
I closed my eyes to the orange skies
Living all of my days the same
Then you came along and you sang your song
And the whole world around me changed
You're my kaleidoscope
You're my kaleidoscope
You're my kaleidoscope
You're my kaleidoscope
You're my kaleidoscope
Like it's the end of the world
I wanna remember the shape of your lips
We'd be lost in each other instead of the smoke
We could be the last love song ever sang
Love you like it's the end of the world
Hold you as long as I can in this world
So let's cheers to the moments of beauty we've found
As the city burns to the ground
Write stories about us and carve us in stone
So they can remember what true love was like
We could be the last love song ever sang
Love you like it's the end of the world
Hold you as long as I can in this world
So let's cheers to the moments of beauty we've found
As the city burns to the ground
Be here now as the skies crash down
I miss the words we used to say
I miss the sounds of yesterday
I miss the games we used to play like oh
I was trapped inside a dream
I couldn't see her next to me
I didn't know she'd set me free like oh
Something happens when I hold her
She keeps my heart from getting older
When the days get short and the nights get a little bit colder
Everything looks different now
All this time my head was down
He came along and showed me how to let go
I can't remember where I'm from
All I know is who I've become
That our love has just begun like oh
Something happens when I hold him
He keeps my heart from getting broken
When the days get short and the nights get a little bit frozen
If I'm stressing you that blessing that's sent from heaven
These days start to feel like hours and hours feel more like seconds
People judged us they couldn't see the connection
We hold each other so tight they couldn't break us if they tried
I know that we've been through a lot
I know that we both grew up
You know I missed you a lot
When I was young I was dumb
Didn't think you'd fit in my plot
And I appreciate the break because I love what we got now
You give me chills and I can't imagine you leaving
If I could build a perfect person honestly you would be it
And you know nobody knows you like I know you
I can't wait to come back home so I can hold you
Something happens when I hold her
She keeps my heart from getting older
When the days get short and the nights get a little bit colder
When we're lost in a desert night
And we're chasing our paradise
When we can't fight another fight
When we're lost in a desert night
And we're chasing our paradise
When we can't fight another fight
As I roam through the wasteland
You're the one thing I need
I see you off in the distance
When we're lost in a desert night
And we're chasing our paradise
When we can't fight another fight
When we're lost in a desert night
And we're chasing our paradise
When we can't fight another fight
I wanna be a thought inside your mind
I wanna see the starlight through your eyes
Say you'll go with me tonight
Move in just a little closer
Show me what it's like
Walking on a wire above the ground
And say you'll go with me tonight
Move in just a little closer
Show me what it's like
Show me how to let go
Show me how to let go
Show me how to let go
Show me how to let go
Move in just a little closer
Show me what it's like
I'll take another sunrise
Another hand to hold tight
I am way too young and I won't stop running
I am way too young and I won't stop running
I don't know how much longer I can fake it
And I know that life is what you make it
But it's hard to see stars when you're always caught in the folds
But I won't stop dreaming
I'll take another sunrise
Another hand to hold tight
I am way too young and I won't stop running
I am way too young and I won't stop running
I'd rather be the one that starts the fire
Than to shut my mouth and be the one who gets burned
I wanna love and be the one who is loved
I'll take another sunrise
Another hand to hold tight
I am way too young and I won't stop running
I am way too young and I won't stop running
I'm tearing off the labels
I am way too young and I won't stop running
I'll take another sunrise
Another hand to hold tight
Nobody else would forgive my mistakes
Nobody else would have stayed
You saw what we could be
One step ahead always
Guiding me through my haze
Was too scared to see what this could mean
All of my hang ups and all of my fears
You made them all disappear
You saw what we could be
One step ahead always
Guiding me through my haze
Was too scared to see what this could mean
Nobody else would forgive my mistakes
Nobody else would have stayed
You saw what we could be
One step ahead always
Guiding me through my haze
Was too scared to see what this could mean
I spent my life trying to answer to the voice inside my head
But all I found were empty questions from a time that I forget
And now I finally see
And now I finally see
But there was beauty in the darkest parts of my uncertainty
And now I finally see
And now I finally see
I feel it beating in my heart
I feel it beating in my heart
I feel it beating in my heart
I feel it beating in my heart
I feel it beating in my heart
I feel it beating in my heart
And now I finally see
And now I finally see
And now I finally see
And now I finally see
And now I finally see
And now I finally see
And now I finally see
What happened before was a waste of time
Than who's right or who's wrong
And the bombs come down
I will hear your heart beating
When the morning comes
You will hear my heart beating
Can't erase what has passed
But we're still alive in a world
That wants to keep us alive
And let the pieces fall
And the bombs come down
I will hear your heart beating
When the morning comes
You will hear my heart beating
And the bombs come down
I will hear your heart beating
When the morning comes
You will hear my heart beating
You will hear my heart beating
I don't want this to end
Let's hang on to the moment we're in
Of all the things we will remember
Today will stick with me forever
Even if we have to say goodbye
We're too young to get lost looking back
Life doesn't always give us answers
If we're not meant to be together
Someday we'll know the reasons why
Of all the things we will remember
Today will stick with me forever
Even if we have to say goodbye
I don't want this to end
I breathe out as the cold wind catches my breathe
And I watch it flow away hoping that a part of me will touch you
Because I know you'll feel the difference in the air and you'll think about me
That's all I want from you
I know we talked about it but the pain just wont go away
Don't tell me that things will become better
Because I know that everyday will be the same
I've been driving all night
And there's no one in sight
I'll make best friends with myself
Till you come back home
I'll drive through all the street lights
Through all the empty roads
All these footprints left behind
Anything will come of this
I wear a smile to hide the pain
Of watching him touch you
And I know his touch is unfamiliar
And I know you never wanted this like this
The day your life is spent
You'll walk among the dead
You'll stand unseen to me
Then you'll regret the day
Heartbreak last forever and never fails to win
Unless the one who left you here can experience that same sin
Remember when you can never trust anyone but her
And now she's just a stranger who walks by
So find your faith and pray to your god that you don't make that wrong turn
Keep your hand in your packets and your thoughts in your mind
Until the night comes
Cause now it's her turn
I see your face but your shadow tells a different story
Evil has never looked so good in a smile like hers
One kiss I fall to the fall
This is how the body reacts to poison
Set out to find the crime in your eyes
You have troubles ill find you
You can't tell me you care about what goes on in my head
I know that you say what you believe is not what I see
Oh why must it be like this
I never thought it would
Who's left to embrace me
This soul as dark as night
One by one you'll rest in pieces
The lines on your face stay
A smile never goes away
Your permanent mask of everything I want to see
But when it gets old it starts to look fake
And you left with no one to show
A secret so well kept that not even you know
What's it like to be blind to what could change your life Forever
How does it feel when I look away
How does it feel when I know better
Such a beautiful sight not to see your face
So don't catch me if I fall
You think I'm down and out but I'm still standing
A life inspired by a broken heart is never the same
As a life inspired by a thoughtless heart with no one to blame
And now I know the truth about you
And now I know my way around you
You think I missed my days without you
I fucking wish I never found you
Believe me when I say...
I breathe out as the cold wind catches my breathe
And I watch it flow away hoping that a part of me will touch you
Because I know you'll feel the difference in the air and you'll think about me
That's all I want from you
I know we talked about it but the pain just wont go away
Faking my death was never this fun
A blade is my saving grace
Empty phone calls left me wanting more
My fear of acceptance kept me from you
But your voice it calmed my nerves now look at you
Look at what you've become
I can't take these steps again
The path to the closet
Lock me inside away from you
Will I ever see your face again
If you really wanted my heart
You would have no patience in waiting to hear my voice
The clock says 12 but I don't know its wrong
Cause you said you'd be gone last night
Black cat that crosses your path
Ladder over your head
The mirror you break in vain
Even broke its promises sometimes
But now I know that love doesn't even try
And I will live through this
I feel this as much as you do and it hurts to know
That you're out there not by my side
Like a ghost I walk through this town for all to see through me
Your letters are starting to sound
Less like stories and more like just words
The drugs we did together
Are not even memories
More like therapy for you and I
Say another bleeding word
And we'll drown in all this mess
There's nothing right with being wrong
There's something so wrong with this
Ill drive this car only far enough to get over you
But this tank ain't filled enough to get away
By the time I decide you'd have already made it there
I try to steer but this bottle makes it so unclear
I bought it as I saw it and so it turns out
Your no benefit to me
And people close to me say
You have two faces and I would not put it past you
But that's who I fell into
Only accepting you for you
It feels so good to lose to you
It feels so good to lose you
Day break brings out the worst in me
The side that no one else can see
The time that always helps to be alone
When Everything that's on my mind
That keeps my life next to the line
Is all poured out and lost upon the floor
The last 10 hours of my day
And like a killer kill my every dream
Addicted to a lot of bad habits with nothing to lose
But a habit like you that's worth the bruise
And every time I realize that you make me feel dead inside helps me from craving all your lies
So Place your hands upon my eyes
To erase all that I see in you
Hold my heart in your palms
Kill all I know and leave no clues
Hold tight my head has taken enough
I need time to let what you said set in
Just like a snake in the grass you go behind my back and sneak around
You say these things that disintegrate my trust and like a fool
I play this game while you watch
What type of friend is a friend that befriends my love and lets me down
So I'll murder this last drink and pass out without you next to me
For the first time and for the last so it seems
It makes me scared to know you were all I need
Now there's nothing left to hold
You must really believe that you are something special
But I can see right through everything your made of
Your vanity is pouring out all over your vanity
But you don't mind it's so plain to see
That your easy baby your so easy
It's a dull fair in return for
En la America Central
I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
Blue since the day we parted
I've been angry and sad about the things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
Blue since the day we parted
Blue since the day we parted
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
I open the window and I gaze into the night
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
And it's gonna be so different when I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
Part of a success that never ends
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms and hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
Super trouper lights are gonna find me
And so I dealt you the blow
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
Wishing she had never left at all
I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
That's how I started the show
Now I've changed and I want you to know
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
Wishing she had never left at all
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
A sense of expectation hanging in the air
Across the room your eyes are glowing in the dark
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
I know what you think
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
You seem so far away though you are standing near
I really tried to make it out
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
Leave them burning and then you're gone
You're in the mood for dance
And when you get the chance
Digging the dancing queen
Digging the dancing queen
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
My love is strong enough to last when things are rough
You say that I waste my time but I can't get you off my mind
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
Cause everything is new
And everything is you
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Only a week since we started
I was an impossible case
No one ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
What's the name of the game
Does it mean anything to you
What's the name of the game
Can you feel it the way I do
What I'm trying to conceal
Would you let me down
Would you laugh at me
If I said I cared for you
Could you feel the same way too
Does it mean anything to you
What's the name of the game
Can you feel it the way I do
What I'm trying to conceal
Would you let me down
Would you laugh at me
If I said I cared for you
Would you feel the same way too
Does it mean anything to you
What's the name of the game
Can you feel it the way I do
What's the name of the game
Does it mean anything to you
What's the name of the game
The summer air was soft and warm
Did it's best to please us
Smiled like Mona Lisa
It was a fine and true romance
I can still recall our last summer
We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
But underneath we had a fear of flying
Like we were dancing our last dance
We could laugh and play
And now you're working in a bank
And your name is Harry
Yet you're the hero of my dreams
I can still recall our last summer
My grades are down from A's to D's
I'm way behind in history
I lost myself in fantasies
Of you and me together
Bouncing off the ceiling
Stranger to this feeling
Got no clue what I should do
I'll go crazy if I can't get next to you
My teacher says to concentrate
The kings and queens will have to wait
Bouncing off the ceiling
Stranger to this feeling
Got no clue what I should do
I'll go crazy if I can't get next to you
One day will be the day when all my dreams come true
Bouncing off the ceiling
Stranger to this feeling
Got no clue what I should do
I'll go crazy if I can't get next to you
Bouncing off the ceiling
Stranger to this feeling
Got no clue what I should do
We have been waiting to catch this moment
So let the music control your feelings
Summertime brings joy to life
Music makes you dance all night
Everyone let's all get down
So you cannot get enough
So you cannot get enough
We're having fun and we just won't stop
Summertime brings joy to life
Music makes you dance all night
Everyone let's all get down
To the melody we found
So you cannot get enough
So you cannot get enough
All the people feel the music
All the people feel the music
Summertime brings joy to life
Music makes you dance all night
Everyone lets all get down
To the melody we found
And you'll be falling in love
So you cannot get enough
And you'll be falling in love
So you cannot get enough
And you'll be falling in love
So you cannot get enough
And you'll be falling in love
So you cannot get enough
Baby I will soon be leaving
And I know that you are feeling down... down... down...
But every week I'll send a letter
To let you know my love will never change
I promise you I always feel the same
So remember in your heart
Baby when we are apart
There is no need for crying
Halfway around the world
That won't stop me from loving you
Halfway around the world
I'll still be feeling the way I do
Now I wanna hold you baby
Even if I'm halfway around the world
Baby when the miles are growing
You and I will still be going strong
No matter what your friends are saying
Don't give up on what you're waiting for
Cause one day I'll be knocking on your door
So remember in your heart
Baby when we are apart
There is no need for crying
Halfway around the world
That won't stop me from loving you
Halfway around the world
I'll still be feeling the way I do
Now I wanna hold you baby
Even if I'm halfway around the world
If I could you know that I would find a way
To stay for good but I must go now
I wanna hold you baby
Halfway around the world
That won't stop me from loving you
Halfway around the world
I'll still be feeling the way I do
Now I wanna hold you baby
Even if I'm halfway around the world
Halfway around the world
That won't stop me from loving you
Halfway around the world
I'll still be feeling the way I do
Now I wanna hold you baby
When I said go I never meant away
You ought to know the freaky games we play
Could you forgive and learn how to forget
Hear me as I'm calling out your name
Firefly come back to me
Make the night as bright as day
I'll be looking out for you
Tell me that your lonely too
Firefly come lead me on
Follow you into the sun
That's the way it ought to be
Firefly come back to me
Like honey to the bee
And if you tell me how to make you understand
I'm minor in a major kinda way
Firefly come back to me
Make the night as bright as day
I'll be looking out for you
Tell me that your lonely too
Firefly come lead me on
Follow you into the sun
That's the way it ought to be
Firefly come back to me
Fly firefly through the sky
Come and play with my desire
Don't be long don't ask why
I get a high whenever you're around
Sweeping from my head to my toes
I gotta get my feet back on the ground
Crossing the line making me say what I have in mind
You make me so excited
And I don't wanna fight it
You are my Sugar Rush
Ain't nothing better baby
You are my Sugar Rush
I got a sweet tooth and a taste for you
It might me too obvious but
I can't help my self from what I do
Making me say what I have in mind
You make me so excited
And I don't wanna fight it
You are my Sugar Rush
Ain't nothing better baby
You are my Sugar Rush
Baby you're my Sugar Rush
I get weak and talk too much
You're the sweetest thing I ever tasted
Baby you're my Sugar Rush
I get weak and talk too much
Making my say what I have in mind
You make me so excited
And I don't wanna fight it
You are my Sugar Rush
Ain't nothing better baby
You are my Sugar Rush
Baby you're my Sugar Rush
I get weak and talk too much
You're the sweetest thing I ever tasted
Baby you're my Sugar Rush
I get weak and talk too much
I see your picture in the paper
Baby you gotta know it's for real
We are miles away from nowhere
We've been walking down this same old road again
As the raindrops fall down on me
I wanna be the one for you
I see your picture in the paper
Baby you gotta know it's for real
If you want my heart I'll give it to you
There's no problem to give
If you knew how many nights
I've been sitting by your bed
Running fingers through your hair
Every time I call your name
Or softly whisper in your ear
You turn around to look for me
I'll be around just want you to know
If you're lost without me
Wondering where I might be
I'll be waiting just around the corner of your eye
Like an angel watching
Meet me when you're dreaming
I'll be waiting just around the corner of your eye
I could be your pot of gold
But do you really want to find
Let me know and I'll come true
I will give my all to you
But don't let anybody take
I'll be around just want you to know
If you're lost without me
Wondering where I might be
I'll be waiting just around the corner of your eye
Like an angel watching
Meet me when you're dreaming
I'll be waiting just around the corner of your eye
There's a song playing in every heart beating
In a key that unlocks every door
There's a time for knowing what's behind the curtain
The days that I've spent apart from you
Have been really hard for me
I wanted to be so close to you
And to live my fantasy
Now you've got me climbing on the walls
I can't wait to put down my books and run to you
And now I'm just waiting for your call
Cause all that I've got
Over and over and over again
With the games you wanna play
You have got me going now
I know you can give me
The things I'm dreaming of
You and me baby we've got
The way that you're moving to the beat
I wanna stay closer to your heat
There's a fire burning inside my body girl
And all that I've got
Over and over and over again
With the games you wanna play
You have got me going now
I know you can give me
The things I'm dreaming of
You and me baby we've got
I will give you the world give you the world
I will give you the world give you the world
When you were lost in the rain
You told me to save you
From all the pain in your heart
I can give you everything you need
If you only say you'll stay with me
Is what I wanna give you
I'll be there to take you just a little higher
That flame that grows inside
I can give you everything you want
If you only say you'll be the one
Is what I wanna give you
I'll be there to take you just a little higher
I can give you everything you need
And you were there waiting
I guess I wasn't thinking of you
It's not that I don't care
You should know me better by now
I am sorry if I made you lonely and sad
I am sorry I made you feel bad
What I'm trying to say
I'm not always that way
So love me for all that I am
The times that I might have hurt you that way
It's not that I don't care
You should know me better by now
I am sorry if I made you lonely and sad
I am sorry I made you feel bad
What I'm trying to say
I'm not always that way
So love me for all that I am
Though I know deep down I've done wrong
But when the heat comes down it's you
Trying to say that I'm not always that way
I am sorry if I made you lonely and sad
I am sorry I made you feel bad
What I'm trying to say
I'm not always that way
So love me for all that I am
That's what it's all about
Dressed up for a cruise tonight
Nothing can hold us back
We're alive and right on track
Nothing can stop us now
We gotta start right now
That's what it's all about baby
That's the way that it's got to be
That's what it is going on baby
That's what it's all about baby
That's what it comes down to baby
I want you to hear me out
That's what it's all about
We're sneaking out the back door
Till the lights go out
We're gonna show what it's all about
We're gonna take it to the top
Spread the word around
That's what it's all about baby
That's the way that it's got to be
That's what it is going on baby
That's what it's all about baby
That's what it comes down to baby
I want you to hear me out
That's what it's all about
There's nothing that can stop us now
I swear we'll always be around
We gotta start right now
That's what it's all about baby
That's the way that it's got to be
That's what it is going on baby
That's what it's all about baby
That's what it comes down to baby
I want you to hear me out
That's what it's all about
That's what it's about...
Once upon a time I was a young man
Always knew what I wanted to do
These times were still the best as I remember
Cause nothing was impossible to me
Then one day I met you and I still wonder
How you could make my dreams come through so fast
I doubted that such a miracle would happen
But you saw something deep inside of me
I believe in the morning light
When I know you'll be calling
I believe in the morning light
When I know you'll be there
I believe in the morning light
Where I know I will see your face again
I can't accept the fact that you are gone now
Somehow there is a way just tell me how
I'll stay around as long as it may take you
To turn around and see that I'm still here
I believe in the morning light
When I know you'll be calling
I believe in the morning light
When I know you'll be there
I believe in the morning light
Where I know I will see your face again
When you think the party's over
Look over your shoulder
We'll be coming back for more
I know I might seem weird
But I won't think I'm kissing you till that's a fact
When you think the party's over
Look over your shoulder
Dancing in the moonlight
Till the break of daylight
We'll be coming back for more
And all I need is someone like you by my side
You saw the movie too
We'll ride into the sunset like they always do
When you think the party's over
Look over your shoulder
Dancing in the moonlight
Till the break of daylight
We'll be coming back for more
We'll be coming back for more
If I'm still number one
The one you're looking for
I won't be gone for long
When you think the party's over
Look over your shoulder
Dancing in the moonlight
Till the break of daylight
I see you every day on the morning bus
You seem a little sad and lonely
I try to look away but when you pass my seat
I always hope that you will notice me
Wish I could let you know
How I feel before you have to go
I'll be your sunshine in pouring rain
I can't help myself going slightly mad
I slipped a note into your pocket
And I wait all night for the phone to ring
I wonder if you got the message
We might not be meant to be
But I hope time will tell differently
I'll be your sunshine in pouring rain
Now we are perfect strangers
I'll be your sunshine in pouring rain
I'll be your sunshine in pouring rain
So you better make it hot
A groove so unique that it kicks me off my seat
Play that funky music
That is how we want it
That is how we need it
Crank up a bass that can raise up the roof
Play that funky music
That is how we want it
That is how we need it
You know by the sounds when the crowd is getting wild
Hands swinging high like a chopper in the sky
Play that funky music
That is how we want it
That is how we need it
That is how we want it
That is how we need it
I just can't help falling in love with you
But I can't help falling in love with you
And if I can't help falling in love with you
Some things are meant to be
Some things are meant to be
Take my whole life through
But I can't help falling in love with you
Some things are meant to be
Some things are meant to be
Take my whole life through
But I can't help falling in love with you
Take my whole life through
But I can't help falling in love with you
But I can't help falling in love
Falling in love with you
I just can't help falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
I just can't help falling in love with you
Closed every door putting everything aside
Hooked on to you and my life was passing by
I stood in a cloud of dust
Blinded till you cut me off
I'm back in the light getting over you
Now I got it together
I'm stronger than ever
Back on a track with a better view
And I'm getting closer to perfection because of you
Gone in a beat suddenly out of my sight
Shook me around like a thunder bolting strike
I stand in the light of faith
I thank you in so many ways
I'm back in the light getting over you
Now I got it together
I'm stronger than ever
Back on a track with a better view
And I'm getting closer to perfection because of you
Closer to perfection cause of you
Closer to perfection cause of you
All the things I wouldn't do without holding on to you
And take those big blue eyes
It don't belong to you
It sure has crossed my mind
I gotta be true this time
And as we kiss goodbye
See on the surface you're this perfect angel inside
There's nothing you can't hide
And I could get addicted
Sure as every movie is
No shade when you walk by
And that is falling bad
So I don't lose what I have
And as you smile at me
See on the surface you're this perfect angel inside
There's nothing you can't hide
Sugar ain't as sweet as you
On the surface you're this perfect angel inside
There's nothing you can't hide
Sugar ain't as sweet as you
We're suddenly connected
Sure as we both need air
So you better make it hot
A groove so unique that it kicks me off my seat
Play that funky music
That is how we want it
That is how we need it
Crank up a bass that can raise up the roof
Play that funky music
That is how we want it
That is how we need it
You know by the sounds when the crowd is getting wild
Hands swinging high like a chopper in the sky
Play that funky music
That is how we want it
That is how we need it
That is how we want it
That is how we need it
Without you by my side
Memories and sad songs
Now I Know yeah I realize
I see the world with different eyes
Give me one more chance
And I'll make it all up to you
So have a little faith in me
But a little trust in me
Every little thing will be alright
Every little thing will be just fine
Have a little faith in me
And I will hold you in my arms tonight
Sitting here by the telephone
I Try to call but you're not home
I'm drifting away in echoes of yesterday
So have a little faith in me
But a little trust in me
Every little thing will be alright
Every little thing will be just fine
Have a little faith in me
And I will hold you in my arms tonight
So have a little faith in me
But a little trust in me
Every little thing will be alright
Every little thing will be just fine
Have a little faith in me
And I will hold you in my arms tonight
So have a little faith in me
But a little trust in me
Every little thing will be alright
Every little thing will be just fine
Have a little faith in me
And I will hold you in my arms tonight
You spend your money on diamonds and pearls
But even so we're a perfect match
I know the south park series by heart
But even so we're a perfect match
But what we have is a perfect match
I got holes all over my jeans
But even so we're a perfect match
But what we have is a perfect match
Ain't got time to take a fast train
My baby just wrote me a letter
I don't care how much money I gotta spend
I got to get back to my baby again
My baby just wrote me a letter
Well she wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen Mister can't you see I got to get back to my baby once more
Ain't got time to take a fast train
My baby just wrote me a letter
I don't care how much money I gotta spend
I got to get back to my baby again
My baby just wrote me a letter
Well she wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen Mister can't you see I got to get back to my baby once more
Ain't got time to take a fast train
My baby just wrote me a letter
My baby just wrote me a letter
I don't care how much money I spend
Got to get back to my baby again
My baby just wrote me a letter
My baby wrote me a letter
My baby wrote me a letter
My baby just wrote me a letter
Ain't got the time to take a fast train
My baby just wrote me a letter
I don't care how much money I got to spend
Got to get back to my baby again
My baby just wrote me a letter
Closed every door putting everything aside
Hooked on to you and my life was passing by
I stood in a cloud of dust
Blinded till you cut me off
I'm back in the light getting over you
Now I got it together
I'm stronger than ever
Back on a track with a better view
And I'm getting closer to perfection because of you
Gone in a beat suddenly out of my sight
Shook me around like a thunder bolting strike
I stand in the light of faith
I thank you in so many ways
I'm back in the light getting over you
Now I got it together
I'm stronger than ever
Back on a track with a better view
And I'm getting closer to perfection because of you
Closer to perfection cause of you
Closer to perfection cause of you
All the things I wouldn't do without holding on to you
I can't tell right from wrong
You can say that when we kiss
I know it's getting late
But like a twist of fate
My clock stops when I'm with you
Though time is ticking way too fast
We can make this moment last
I don't want the night to end
You and I will see the break of day
The look upon your eyes
Says your mind's made up
You don't have to think twice
So what's it gonna be
Will there be you and I
Wanna try to make you see
That time is ticking way too fast
We can make this moment last
I don't want the night to end
You and I will see the break of day
You really make my head spin
Don't know where you end and I begin
But it's not like I care.
You and I will see the break of day
You and I will see the break of day
You and I will see the break of day
And the city don't know what the city is getting
Show with everything but Yul Brynner
Time flies doesn't seem a minute
Since the Tyrolean spa has the chess boys in it
It's Iceland or the Philippines or Hastings or this place
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the god's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me
One town is very like another
When you head's down over your pieces brother
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite
I get my kicks above the waistline sunshine
Not much between despair and ecstasy
I can feel the devil walking next to me
Siam's gotta be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a
Muddy old river or reclining Buddha
And thank god I'm only watching the game
I don't see you guys rating
The kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch I would invite you
But the queens wee use would not excite you
So you'd better go back to your bars
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
A little flesh a little history
I can feel an angel sliding up to me
Not much between despair and ecstasy
I just can't help falling in love with you
But I can't help falling in love with you
And if I can't help falling in love with you
Some things are meant to be
Some things are meant to be
Take my whole life through
But I can't help falling in love with you
Some things are meant to be
Some things are meant to be
Take my whole life through
But I can't help falling in love with you
Take my whole life through
But I can't help falling in love with you
But I can't help falling in love
Falling in love with you
I just can't help falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
I just can't help falling in love with you
In the still of the night
I can almost feel you lying next to me
And it's hard to let go
When there's always something there reminding me
I've tried to get you off my mind
I've tried to play my part
But every time I close my eyes
You're still inside my heart
Every time we say goodbye
Why does it rain here in my heart
Every day that we're apart
Why can't it be just you and me
What will it take to make you see
To my heartbreak lullaby
Like the stars in the sky
You still keep on shining down on me
And I know in that time
I try to look the other way
And keep my heart on hold
But every time I'm close to you
I lose my self control
Every time we say goodbye
Why does it rain here in my heart
Every day that we're apart
Why can't it be just you and me
What will it take to make you see
To my heartbreak lullaby
Give me just one good reason why
Why does it rain here in my heart
Every day that we're apart
Why can't it be just you and me
What will it take to make you see
To my heartbreak lullaby
Every time we say goodbye
Why does it rain here in my heart
Every day that we're apart
Why can't it be just you and me
What will it take to make you see
To my heartbreak lullaby
I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
Blue since the day we parted
I've been angry and sad about the things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
Blue since the day we parted
Blue since the day we parted
My grades are down from A's to D's
I'm way behind in history
I lost myself in fantasies
Of you and me together
Bouncing off the ceiling
Stranger to this feeling
Got no clue what I should do
I'll go crazy if I can't get next to you
My teacher says to concentrate
The kings and queens will have to wait
Bouncing off the ceiling
Stranger to this feeling
Got no clue what I should do
I'll go crazy if I can't get next to you
One day will be the day when all my dreams come true
Bouncing off the ceiling
Stranger to this feeling
Got no clue what I should do
I'll go crazy if I can't get next to you
Bouncing off the ceiling
Stranger to this feeling
Got no clue what I should do
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
I open the window and I gaze into the night
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
So you better make it hot
A groove so unique that it kicks me off my seat
Play that funky music
That is how we want it
That is how we need it
Crank up a bass that can raise up the roof
Play that funky music
That is how we want it
That is how we need it
You know by the sounds when the crowd is getting wild
Hands swinging high like a chopper in the sky
Play that funky music
That is how we want it
That is how we need it
That is how we want it
That is how we need it
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
Leave them burning and then you're gone
You're in the mood for dance
And when you get the chance
Digging the dancing queen
Digging the dancing queen
You spend your money on diamonds and pearls
But even so we're a perfect match
I know the south park series by heart
But even so we're a perfect match
But what we have is a perfect match
I got holes all over my jeans
But even so we're a perfect match
But what we have is a perfect match
We have been waiting to catch this moment
So let the music control your feelings
Summertime brings joy to life
Music makes you dance all night
Everyone let's all get down
So you cannot get enough
So you cannot get enough
We're having fun and we just won't stop
Summertime brings joy to life
Music makes you dance all night
Everyone let's all get down
To the melody we found
So you cannot get enough
So you cannot get enough
All the people feel the music
All the people feel the music
Summertime brings joy to life
Music makes you dance all night
Everyone lets all get down
To the melody we found
And you'll be falling in love
So you cannot get enough
And you'll be falling in love
So you cannot get enough
And you'll be falling in love
So you cannot get enough
And you'll be falling in love
So you cannot get enough
Baby I will soon be leaving
And I know that you are feeling down... down... down...
But every week I'll send a letter
To let you know my love will never change
I promise you I always feel the same
So remember in your heart
Baby when we are apart
There is no need for crying
Halfway around the world
That won't stop me from loving you
Halfway around the world
I'll still be feeling the way I do
Now I wanna hold you baby
Even if I'm halfway around the world
Baby when the miles are growing
You and I will still be going strong
No matter what your friends are saying
Don't give up on what you're waiting for
Cause one day I'll be knocking on your door
So remember in your heart
Baby when we are apart
There is no need for crying
Halfway around the world
That won't stop me from loving you
Halfway around the world
I'll still be feeling the way I do
Now I wanna hold you baby
Even if I'm halfway around the world
If I could you know that I would find a way
To stay for good but I must go now
I wanna hold you baby
Halfway around the world
That won't stop me from loving you
Halfway around the world
I'll still be feeling the way I do
Now I wanna hold you baby
Even if I'm halfway around the world
Halfway around the world
That won't stop me from loving you
Halfway around the world
I'll still be feeling the way I do
Now I wanna hold you baby
I get a high whenever you're around
Sweeping from my head to my toes
I gotta get my feet back on the ground
Crossing the line making me say what I have in mind
You make me so excited
And I don't wanna fight it
You are my Sugar Rush
Ain't nothing better baby
You are my Sugar Rush
I got a sweet tooth and a taste for you
It might me too obvious but
I can't help my self from what I do
Making me say what I have in mind
You make me so excited
And I don't wanna fight it
You are my Sugar Rush
Ain't nothing better baby
You are my Sugar Rush
Baby you're my Sugar Rush
I get weak and talk too much
You're the sweetest thing I ever tasted
Baby you're my Sugar Rush
I get weak and talk too much
Making my say what I have in mind
You make me so excited
And I don't wanna fight it
You are my Sugar Rush
Ain't nothing better baby
You are my Sugar Rush
Baby you're my Sugar Rush
I get weak and talk too much
You're the sweetest thing I ever tasted
Baby you're my Sugar Rush
I get weak and talk too much
Super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
And it's gonna be so different when I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
Part of a success that never ends
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms and hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
Super trouper lights are gonna find me
In the still of the night
I can almost feel you lying next to me
And it's hard to let go
When there's always something there reminding me
I've tried to get you off my mind
I've tried to play my part
But every time I close my eyes
You're still inside my heart
Every time we say goodbye
Why does it rain here in my heart
Every day that we're apart
Why can't it be just you and me
What will it take to make you see
To my heartbreak lullaby
Like the stars in the sky
You still keep on shining down on me
And I know in that time
I try to look the other way
And keep my heart on hold
But every time I'm close to you
I lose my self control
Every time we say goodbye
Why does it rain here in my heart
Every day that we're apart
Why can't it be just you and me
What will it take to make you see
To my heartbreak lullaby
Give me just one good reason why
Why does it rain here in my heart
Every day that we're apart
Why can't it be just you and me
What will it take to make you see
To my heartbreak lullaby
Every time we say goodbye
Why does it rain here in my heart
Every day that we're apart
Why can't it be just you and me
What will it take to make you see
To my heartbreak lullaby
I just can't help falling in love with you
But I can't help falling in love with you
And if I can't help falling in love with you
Some things are meant to be
Some things are meant to be
Take my whole life through
But I can't help falling in love with you
Some things are meant to be
Some things are meant to be
Take my whole life through
But I can't help falling in love with you
Take my whole life through
But I can't help falling in love with you
But I can't help falling in love
Falling in love with you
I just can't help falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
I just can't help falling in love with you
And all the things we never did
How could we go wrong
I believe in what we had
I believe in what we said
That it's time to let it go
Even there we'd be the same
But now it's time to make
That we always took for granted
Looking back on the love
For you were always on my mind
Where and when did it go wrong
How could we go wrong
I believe in what we had
I believe in what we said
That it's time to let it go
Even there we'd be the same
But now it's time to make
Built our dreams together
We made plans forever
Nothing lasts forever
Where and when did it go wrong
How could we go wrong
I believe in what we had
I believe in what we said
That it's time to let it go
Even there we'd be the same
Let's make the final cut
I believe in what we had
I believe in what we said
That it's time to let it go
Even there we'd be the same
But now it's time to make
When you were there by my side
Now I gotta stop myself from going crazy
I just gotta figure out how to let go
I'm thinking about you
Not to let a day pass by
There's no way to comprehend
Now I gotta stop myself from going crazy
I just gotta figure out how to let go
I promised I'd wait for you
I know you will shine on through
I promised the world to you
You made my dreams come true
How many of us out there
To run and look for shelter
That I'd say a prayer for you
Where all your wish comes true
That I'd make it up to you
My sister and brother
Know I'm in love with you
How many of us out there
Of losing what was once there
The people say about her
Who can live without her
I promised I'd wait for you
I know you will shine on through
I promised the world to you
It's not as hard as it may seem.
On your hopes you must lean.
You have to win yourself.
Give your everything.
You got to bring the heat.
That you deserve what's long overdue.
It's not as hard as it may seem.
On your hopes you must lean.
You have to win yourself.
Give your everything.
I'm still drying my tears.
Getting over my own fears
So I wanna make sure this time
That I'm strong enough
It's not as hard as it may seem.
On your hopes you must lean.
You have to win yourself.
Give your everything.
It's not as hard as it may seem.
On your hopes you must lean.
You have to win yourself.
Give your everything.
It's not as hard as it may seem.
On your hopes you must lean.
You have to win yourself.
Give your everything.
So don't you be afraid.
And the fireworks are through
Feeling lost and feeling blue
It's the end of the party
May we all have a vision now and then
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
And he thinks he'll be okay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway...
May we all have a vision now and then
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
That the dreams we had before
Than confetti on the floor
It's the end of a decade
In another ten years time
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
May we all have a vision now and then
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
When the snowman brings the snow
Well he just might like to know
If you jump into your bed
Quickly cover up your head
Don't you lock the doors
You know that sweet Santa Claus in on the way
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Let the bells ring out for Christmas
When we're skating in the park
If the snow cloud makes it dark
Then your rosy cheek's gonna light my merry way
Now the frosty paws appear
And they've frozen up my ear
So we'll lie by the fire
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
So let the bells ring out for Christmas
He's put a great big smile on somebody's face
I'll sign my name on the rooftop in the snow
Then he may decide to stay
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
So let the bells ring out for Christmas
Let the bells ring out for Christmas
Walking through an empty house
There is nothing we can do
Now there's only emptiness
I've been cheated by you
Since I don't know when
So I've made up my mind it must come to an end
But I finally lose control
That's the fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything
Just how much I missed you
Blue since the day we parted
Did I ever let you go
I could never let you go
I can't count all the times
That's I've told you were through
When you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything
Yes I've been broken hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Did I ever let you go
I could never let you go
Yes I've been broken hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why why did I ever let you go
Yes I've been broken hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Did I ever let you go
I see you walking down the street
I catch your eye before we meet
But you look down to check your feet
But I just smile and walk away
Everyday you took my breath away
But now there's no reply
Like a dream come true
When it was me and you
Now I just don't know why
We say hi and hi and goodbye
But when I pass I look away
It always feels like yesterday
We shared a blanket in the cold
To give a promise made of gold
We had a deal through hearts of stone
Everyday you took my breath away
But now there's no reply
Like a dream come true
When it was me and you
Now I just don't know why
We say hi and hi and goodbye
We always had words to say
And nothing could tear us apart
Now we're only hi and goodbye
Everyday you took my breath away
But now there's no reply
Like a dream come true
When it was me and you
Now I just don't know why
My grades are down from A's to D's
I'm way behind in history
I've lost myself in fantasies
Of you and me together
Bouncing off the ceiling
Stranger to this feeling
Got no clue what I should do
My teacher says to concentrate
So what his name was Peter the Great
The kings and queens will have to wait
Bouncing off the ceiling
Stranger to this feeling
Got no clue what I should do
I'll go crazy if I can't get next to you
Bouncing off the ceiling
Stranger to this feeling
Got no clue what I should do
I'll go crazy if I can't get next to you
Can't stand next to u
Bouncing Off the ceiling
Stranger to this feeling
Got no clue what I should do
I'll go crazy if I can't get next to you
Bouncing Off the ceiling
Changing to this feeling
Got no clue what I should do
I'd go crazy can't get next to...
And I'll go crazy if I can't get next to...
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself
And how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose
So how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose
Take a look at me now
Got plenty going on on my own
You're never quite as thrilling to someone else
What you've got on your mind
We're getting without it just fine
Do I look like I've been taught
Turn you into something you're not
Got better things to do with my time
Don't come to me like you do
She's gonna flash her eyes under moonlit skies
He's gonna meet her there under the exit sign
Let's dance and let the world fall apart
Just howl at the moonlight I say it two times
And we fall from the sky when we hear the sound
Go on for miles but won't hit the ground
Cause baby we are teenage wildlife
I want to have it all
Happiness and love all around
Always wanted finer things
But all that money brings me down
Gonna walk around in your head
It's time to start moving
Gonna walk around in your head
Don't know where you're going
But you know where you stand
When they feel like they don't belong
Some people let it in
While lovers let the moments pass them by
And there's never any question
It was always right in front of your eyes
I'm gonna walk around in your head
You know where you're going
And you know where you stand
When they feel like they don't belong
When they feel like they don't belong
And I'll wait for you now
While you turn things around
I will wait for you now
And they feel like they don't belong
When I wake up in the sunlight
And look into your eyes
And I hold you for a little while
And I see behind your smile
I remember how beautiful I used to think you are
Now the only love that meant something is gone
I should have let you go when I saw that it was over in your eyes
What do I have to do to get rid of you
I'll be better on my own
It's just another rainy day in London
It's just another rainy day in London
I still hold onto the memory of how we were meant to be
And I wonder did you ever care
You were never there for me
I thought I was stronger
But then why am I here when there's nothing left to say
Now the only love that meant something is gone...
I should have let you go when I saw that it was over in your eyes
What do I have to do to get rid of you
I'll be better on my own
It's just another rainy day in London
It's just another rainy day in London
I remember how beautiful I used to think you are...
I should have let you go when I saw that it was over in your eyes
What do I have to do to get rid of you
I'll be better on my own
It's just another rainy day in London
You know I wanted you for such a long time
Don't think I don't notice your wondering eyes
Keep the options open for a sexier guy
To be caught with you in the spotlight
Girl I know I'm the best I can beat all the rest
But you can't see that
Don't you know I'm gorgeous
So much more that I can be
Don't you know I'm gorgeous
I love myself more than I love you
Baby I know it's hard to understand
Don't think I don't notice when you open your thighs
That they were made for a sexy guy
To be caught with you in the spotlight
And I know I'm the best I can beat all the rest
But you can't see that
Don't you know I'm gorgeous
So much more that I can be
Don't you know I'm gorgeous
I love myself more than I love you
Unlike no other I'll do you right
Unlike your mother your pussy is tight
So much more that I can bring
Don't you know I'm gorgeous
I love myself more than I love you
Love myself love myself more than I love you
What if the sun never rose again
What if the sky turn from blue to red
What if the love we once had was never there
What if you told me you loved me but you didn't really care
I'll be missing the long walks with you in the rain
Until I remember all the pain
There's nothing to live for with you anyway
I couldn't take another day
But what if I'm wrong
Won't be anyone's lips to kiss good night
I'll be wishing I was there to hear you cry
But what if I'm wrong
I'll be left all alone to wonder why
I'll be wishing that I never said goodbye
What if I knew what could have bee
Would it make a difference
And if I left would you come to your senses
I'll be missing the long walks with you in the rain
Until I remember all the pain
There's nothing to live for with you anyway
I couldn't take another day
But what if I'm wrong
Won't be anyone's lips to kiss good night
I'll be wishing I was there to hear you cry
But what if I'm wrong
I'll be left all alone to wonder why
I'll be wishing that I never said goodbye
I'll be missing the long walks with you in the rain
Until I remember all the pain
There is nothing to live for with you anyway
But what if I'm wrong
But what if I'm wrong
Won't be anyone's lips to kiss good night
I'll be wishing I was there to hear you cry
But what if I'm wrong
I'll be left all alone to wonder why
I'll be wishing that I never said goodbye
All right now remember that
Swinging out everywhere
I touched you and my heart stopped
Now I know I'm totally fucked
I'm gonna take you in my car
Let you give me a ride
And tell me now quick or slow
And if you get too serious
I'll tell you goodbye
Girl you better realize
This ain't nothing but a
We went a little too fast
I can't believe I did this
Let it happen with a just one kiss
So tell me what'd you do
Would you wanna give it up
And I fell in love and now I'm totally screwed
This is more than just a
So tell me what'd you do
Would you wanna give it up
And I fell in love and now I'm totally screwed
It's not a drive by love
You pulled up next to me in your fancy car
She said take me to the places where your horses run free
Baby if you know how to ride you can ride me
Said if you wanna rock I got a condom in my pocket
She said baby you're the key so come and unlock it
If love is crazy let's go crazy we can do it alright
We barely made it down the street we didn't get far
It doesn't matter where I go there you are
Said she's a sexy thriller dressed in black and red
If love is crazy let's go crazy we can do it alright
On the floor on the pavement wake the neighbors let's make a statement
Put your legs up in the air smack that ass
And pull your hair take a picture man I don't care
You play checkers I'll play chess then we'll see
Who moves the best you're the teacher
And I'm the pet shut up let's... sex
If love is crazy let's go crazy we can do it alright
If love is crazy let's go crazy we can do it alright
I burn the pages in my head
But the memories are so clear
A thousand words left unsaid
And you never shed a tear
You say that you wanna be close to me
Now the tables have turned
You can learn how to live without me
Pictures up on the wall
Suddenly now you're all about me
The only thing that I learned from you
Was how to walk out the door
All you left me was my name
I know you wanna be in my shoes
Now the tables have turned
You can learn how to live without me
Pictures up on the wall
Suddenly now you're all about me
The only thing that I learned from you
Was how to walk out the door
I just wanna forgive and forget all about you
From this place in between loving and hating you
Don't know where to belong
I burn the pages in my head
But the memories are so clear
Now the tables have turned
You can learn how to live without me
Pictures up on the wall
Suddenly now you're all about me
The only thing that I learned from you
You're always bringing me down
Why did I always stick around
Say I got to see things your way
Gotta get away from my biggest mistake
It's been a long time coming to this
Oh wait don't tell me this is finally it
I got my pride to think about
My whole life to sort it out
You can't fire me I quit
How does it feel to be wrong
Stuck on stupid for so long
You always wanna have the last word
You say you're gonna leave but let me be the first
To hit you right where it hurts
It's been a long time coming to this
Oh wait don't tell me this is finally it
I got my pride to think about
My whole life to sort it out
I can't believe that I
Put up with all the lies
Now baby it's my time
Gotta move on with my life
It's been a long time coming to this
Oh wait don't tell me this is finally it
I got my pride to think about
My whole life to sort it out
You can't fire me I quit
I hate it when I come home
And you're already asleep
I hate it when you throw things out
Without talking to me
I hate how you've come to expect
I hate the way you seem to always make us late
I hate the way you keep it so cold in this room
I hate how you steal the covers
I hate how you fight with your mother
I hate it when you're gone.
I hate it when I ask If I'm the best that you've had
I hate it when you compare me to others that came before
I hate the way you whisper to your friends on the phone
The way you can make me feel so alone
I hate it when I feel like I'm trying to hard
I need you where you barely see me
And more than admitting I'm wrong
I hate it when you're gone
You roll your eyes and say whatever
I hate just how much I adore you
And I hate that I can't be there for you
And more than admitting I'm wrong
I hate it when I see you crying
You say you're okay but you're lying
And more than the dark hates the dawn
I hate it when you're gone
I won't deny that I can't live without you
Don't do it on your own
Don't do it on your own
Don't do it on your own
Don't ask me why never have to try so
Let me introduce you to the coolest guy I know
Even if you think you'll find someone he'll never be just like me
They would think that you're insane not to wanna know my name
What exactly do you think you'll find on the other side
Let me introduce you to the coolest guy I know
Even if you think you'll find someone he'll never be just like me
You'd cross this line
Let me introduce you to the coolest guy I know
Even if you think you'll find someone he'll never be just like me
I see people come and go
My mother told me she said don't let life control me
I'm everything you wanted me to be
But you can see I'm not very happy
I need some time to find myself within me
And I need some time to find true love
And if I can't then I won't stop trying
And if I don't then I won't keep lying
They want to be happy
Something about the way you moved that caught my eye
The way your body swayed
As I watched you from behind
Baby let me be the one to hold you
To give you all the things I know you miss
You know that we can wait another lifetime
And we can never find a love just like this
You can get on inside me
And I can get on inside you too
You will wake up beside me forever
Maybe we will discover
We can be more than lovers
I'll give you what you need
Just come to me and get it
Baby you won't regret it
Baby move a little close
And before this night is over
You will know just what it means
To be loved until you scream
You can get on inside me
And I can get on inside you too
You can wake up beside me forever
You can get on inside me
And I can get on inside you too
You can wake up beside me forever
You can get on inside me
And I can get on inside you too
You can wake up beside me forever
I was walking down the street
You pulled up next to me
She said take me to the place
Where your horses run free
Baby if you know how to ride
Said if you wanna rock it
Got a condom in my pocket
She said baby you're they key
So come and unlock it
We can do it all night
We can do it all night
We can do it all night
Barely made it down the street I didn't get far
It doesn't matter where I go there you are
See this sexy fella dressed in black and red
Girl you're so fucking cool in your shades that you wear yeah
We can do it all night
We can do it all night
We can do it all night
Take me home down to the basement
Let's make a statement
Put your legs up in the air
Smack that ass and pull your hair
Then we'll see who moves the best
We can do it all night
We can do it all night
We can do it all night
We can do it all night
Love leads to laughter
I feel good times again
These feelings before
You showed me the world
How can I ask for more
And although there's confusion
We'll find a solution
To keep my heart close to you
There is nothing that I would
Although times can be hard
We will see it through
I'm forever in love with you
In all different ways
For the rest of my days
With you all my troubles
When I look in your eyes
And although there's confusion
We'll find a solution
To keep my heart close to you
There is nothing that I would
Although times can be hard
We will see it through
I'm forever in love with you
I'll be right by your side
There is nothing that I would
Although times can be hard
We will see it through
There is nothing that I would
Although times can be hard
We will see it through
That's the way we do it baby
That's the way we do it
That's the way we do it baby
That's the way we do it
I'll take you to a wonderland
You hit me right between the eyes
You sent me soaring to the skies
The planet moon and stars
You've got to believe
Be the first to believe
You hit me right between the eyes
You sent me soaring to the skies
The planet moon and stars
Yeah you gotta believe
Be the first to believe
Said be the first to believe
Be the first to believe
That's the way we do it baby
That's the way we do it
That's the way we do it baby
That's the way we do it
This paradise is ours
The planet moon and stars
This paradise is ours
The planet moon and stars
Be the first to believe
Said be the first to believe
Be the first to believe
Oh you got to believe
You gotta be the first to believe
Summertime of our lives
Hey girl the feeling is right
Hot sand holding your hand
We'll have the time of our lives
Blue skies sea in your eyes
Let the groove move my people all around me
We'll have the time of our lives
Sugar candy cherry world
There's a boy for every girl
Sugar candy cherry world
We'll have the time of our lives
Are you up for it get down with it
Are you up for it get down with it
Are you up for it get down with it
There's magic within you
There's magic in everything you do
Magic me to the place where dreams come true
I get off on the crazy things we do
I'm jealous of every guy that looks at you
The game that you're playing
You gotta let me down or see it through
You're straight from a movie
You can't hide the love inside
Someone's come and taken me
Where I don't wanna go
Exactly what I have to do
In order to be there for you
When you are feeling low
And all the things we ever wanted
Were once yours and mine
Now I know we can revive it
All the love we left...
And every time I close my eyes
That every time I hold
The sweetest thing my heart
And I have never felt this way
I gave your love away
I've fallen from my destiny
You and I were meant to be
I've thrown it all away
It's time for me to carry on
But baby I just can't go on
Without you by my side
And all the things we ever wanted
Were once yours and mine
Now I know we can revive it
All the love we left...
And every time I close my eyes
That every time I hold
The sweetest thing my heart
And I have never felt this way
I gave your love away
All the pain we feel inside
And now I've let you down
Now I promise you forever
I will be the best I can
Now I know we can revive it
All the love we left...
And every time I close my eyes
That every time I hold
The sweetest thing my heart
And I have never felt this way
Since I gave your love away
And every time I close my eyes
That every time I hold
The sweetest thing my heart
And I have never felt this way
I said I'd never leave you
I said that I would never let you down
I needed a chance to prove my love to you
The promises I gave you
I never meant to see them left untrue
And all of the days just pass me by
All that I ask is one more try
If only I listened to my heart
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart
Now all I can dream about is you
And baby that's all I do
If only we two could start anew
I promise I'd never be untrue
And baby that's all I do
You're looking for another
I'm looking for a chance with you again
I guess I never showed you
Everything I told you
And everything I did I feel was wrong
I didn't know the words I said would
And all of the days just pass me by
All that I ask is one more try
If only I listened to my heart
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart
Now all I can dream about is you
And baby that's all I do
If only we two could start anew
I promise I never be untrue
And baby that's all I do
If only I listened to my heart
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart
Now all I can dream about is you
And baby that's all I do
If only I listened to my heart
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart
Now all I can dream about is you
And baby that's all I do
If only we two could start anew
I promise I'd never be untrue
And baby that's all I do
If only I listened to my heart
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart
Now all I can dream about is you
And baby that's all I do
If only we two could start anew
I promise I never be untrue
You see something about them has changed
Don't you take it to heart all the same
You'll see it works out better that way
Don't be afraid to shout your name
There ain't nothing to lose
Come together and say
You don't have to stop the way you're feeling
Let your mind know where it's leading
You'll see the best things in life come for free
If you follow your heart and believe
You'll be excited by what you'll achieve
There ain't nothing to lose
You don't have to stop the way you're feeling
Let your mind know where it's leading
There ain't nothing to lose
Come together and say
You don't have to stop the way you're feeling
Let your mind know where it's leading
You don't have to stop the way you're feeling
Let your mind know where it's leading
And as I look into your eyes
I see an angel in disguise
Sent from God above for me to love
And as I hold your body near
I'll see this month through to a year
And then forever on till life is gone
I'll keep your loving near
And now I've finally found my way
To lead me down this lonely road
All I have to do is follow you
To lighten off my load
You treat me like a rose
You give me room to grow
You shone the light of love on me
And gave me air so I can breathe
You open doors that close
In a world where anything goes
You give me strength so I stand tall
And when I feel like hope is gone
You give me strength to carry on
Each time I look at you there's something new
To keep our loving strong
I hear you whisper in my ear
All of the words I long to hear
Of how you'll always be here next to me
To wipe away my tears
And now I've finally found my way
To lead me down this lonely road
All I have to do is follow you
To lighten off my load
You treat me like a rose
You give me room to grow
You shone the light of love on me
And gave me air so I can breathe
You open doors that close
In a world where anything goes
You give me strength so I stand tall
And though the seasons change
Our love remains the same
When the sunshine turns to rain
You treat me like a rose
You give me room to grow
You shone the light of love on me
And gave me air so I can breathe
You open doors that close
In a world where anything goes
You give me strength so I stand tall
You give me strength so I stand tall
Within this bed of earth
Sitting by the window
Singing songs of love
Wishing you were here
Because the memory's not enough
Wear my mask in silence
Pretending I'm alright
If you could see then you would be
Here standing by my side
It may be hard to believe
But girl you're the only one I need
It may be hard along the way
It's this feeling I get
Feels like I'm walking in the rain
I find myself trying to wash away the pain
I've cried my tears away
Can't help but remember
You dressed my soul and made me whole
You made my life complete
It may be hard to believe
But girl you're the only one I need
It may be hard along the way
It's this feeling I get
Feels like I'm walking in the rain
I find myself trying to wash away the pain
Of all we've said and done
Remains the memories of days
But now when you are gone
I sit alone to watch the setting of the sun
Feels like I'm walking in the rain
I find myself trying to wash away the pain
In this life of uncertainty
There are people that we all need
In you there's a remedy
That makes everyday seem trouble free
No distance and no device
When no one understands
When my world has come undone
And I've lost my setting sun
When all I see are clouds
When I fall into a tear
Inspirations disappear
You clear away that doubt
Now I've stumbled on uncertainty
Never thought this could ever be
No contradictions left inside
When I feel the rain come my way
Intuition's telling me to stay
When my world has come undone
And I've lost my setting sun
When all I see are clouds
When I fall into a tear
Inspirations disappear
You clear away that doubt
In this life of uncertainty
There are people that we all need
In you there's a remedy
That makes everyday seem trouble free
No distance and no device
When no one understands
When my world has come undone
And I've lost my setting sun
When all I see are clouds
When I fall into a tear
Inspirations disappear
You clear away that doubt
When my world has come undone
And I've lost my setting sun
When all I see are clouds
When I fall into a tear
Inspirations disappear
You clear away that doubt
The sun went down so long ago
I watched you cry I had to go
Forever only lasted just a day
And now without you by my side
The visions of a lonely life
Take me to a dream in a place so far away
I see an angel and I think of you
I watch her hide behind a smile
And then I think of what I have to do
If only I had listened for a while
A love so strong will carry on
You know there's so much to be seen
The emptiness of what could be
Shows everything you mean to me
It started out a game I'd never played
If I defy the foolish pride
And find that place so deep inside
I see a rainbow and I think of you
And then I think of what I have to do
If only I had listened for a while
A love so strong will carry on
You know there's so much to be seen
It's not the end let's start again
Everybody's always asking me why
Please believe me when I say what I say
I didn't mean to go away
At the time I couldn't stay
I see an angel and she sees me too
And as she wipes a teary eye
I know exactly what I have to do
To start a new beginning in my life
A love so strong will carry on
You know there's so much to be seen
It's not the end let's start again
You know I still believe
The love we feel inside
The words we need to say
Have always walked alone
But now that you're here with me
There'll always be a place that I can go
Has started to unfold
When you're next to me
I can see the greatest story
Now my life is blessed with
Somebody to keep the dream alive
The dream I found in you
I always thought that love would be
The strangest thing to me
That I found my place in heaven by your side
I'd walk a thousand miles to hear you
Now that I have finally found the
One who will be there for me eternally
Suddenly our destiny has started
When you're next to me I can
See the greatest story love has ever
Now my life is blessed with
Somebody to keep the dream alive
The dream I found in you
I always thought that love would be
The strangest thing to me
Found my place in heaven by your side
That I found my place in heaven by
The greatest story love has ever told
Now my life is blessed with
Somebody to keep the dream alive
The dream I found in you
I always thought that love would be
The strangest thing to me
Found my place in heaven by your side
Now my life is blessed with
Somebody to keep the dream alive
The dream I found in you
I always thought that love would be
The strangest thing to me
I don't know what I'm to say
Today's another day to find you
I'll be coming for you love okay
I'll be gone in a day or two
So needless to say at odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
It's so much better to be safe than sorry
I'll be gone in a day or two
You're all the things I've got to remember
I'll be coming for you anyway
I'll be gone in a day or two
I'll be gone in a day or two
I can still remember the time you were there
You're never never gonna keep your promises
You're never never gonna keep your promises
You said you'd changed
It's something I won't live to see
Can appear to be so real
And yet turn out to be a fantasy
Never gonna keep your promises
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
When you're the same old brand new you
You're never never gonna keep your promises
You're never never gonna keep your promises
I guess we're through
Is this the way it has to be
But I've got better things to do than Let you walk all over me
Never gonna keep your promises
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
When you're the same old brand new you
I can still remember the time you were there
You're never never gonna keep your promises
You're never never gonna keep your promises
Never gonna keep your promises
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
When you're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
You say you're gonna work it out
Then you say you're having doubts.
But then you go and stay
You're calling me day and night
Saying he don't treat you right.
Then you always turn around
And give him one more try.
Baby you know it isn't fair
You expect me to be there.
But we never get nowhere.
I'll make a long story short
Time to make up your mind girl.
Stop telling me you need more time
Tired of the same old line.
Better let him know it's time too go your moving on.
Baby you don't know how close
Tell me if I have your heart.
Baby you know it isn't fair
You expect me to be there.
But we never get nowhere.
If your sure that you really love me.
Out the door if you still don't know.
You belong with me. What you gonna do
Could be the way you freed my mind
You precious touch caressed my soul
You gave me everything I need
And you said I turned my back on
You said I'm not the only one for you
Please give it one more try for the sake of our love
I can't live one more day without you in my arms
Could be the days and nights so wild
Could be the times I wasn't there
And all the nights we didn't share
And you said I turned my back on
You said I'm not the only one for you
Please give it one more try for the sake of our love
I can't live one more day without you in my arms
So lost without you as my guide
Please give it one more try for the sake of our love
I can't live one more day without you in my arms
We sit and talk of friendship then I ask
I see the light die in your eyes
So you don't want to try
We'll take a chance and come home with me
You could stay for eternity
If you try then at least you'll see
The things we never did
You smile at me yet I can see
You don't think we can make it
I see the light die in your eyes
So you don't want to try
Then you'll never regret the things we never did
You're slowly running out of things to say
To make things feel right
You never told me what you feel inside
Now your telling me its
Too bad baby you're so into me
Are slowly running out of things to do
When I say yes you say no
Please tell me why it is that we don't see
Like yesterdays news girl
It started from the day I met her
Walk all over me I let her
Friends who told me go and get her
They're telling me forget her
Too bad baby think I'm going crazy
She's nothing bout trouble
Up till now was a man of common senses
Just a girl that can easily twist your mind
But right now it feels so fine
I'm searching for reason
Cause somewhere inside of me I know
She's nothing but trouble
It's too late I'm just caught up in my
Just a girl that can easily twist your mind ooh...
But right now it feels so fine
I'm searching for reason
Cause somewhere inside of me I know
She's nothing but trouble
But somewhere I realize
I'm searching for reason
Cause somewhere inside of me I know
She's nothing but trouble
Cause somewhere inside of me I know
We will always be this way
Flying Angels lifting high
To reach the sun where I belong
Girl you know you are the one
Above the clouds I see you cry
You know that when you smile
And we will be together
Although I'm gone remember me
All I'm thinking about is
Means you'll never be alone
There'll be times you wonder why ooh...
Seeing you with someone new
Used to make me feel so blue
And we will be together once again
Although I'm gone remember me
All I'm thinking about is
From the moment that I looked into your eyes
All of my life I thought I'd be there
You know that when you smile
And we will be together once again
Although I'm gone remember me
All I'm thinking about is
All I'm thinking about is
Like the first drop of sun from the sky
And she doesn't see me
When she dances she moves me to a smile
I see everything near her shine
There is a grace in her ways I can't contain
I don't have that grace
So she doesn't see me
And the closer I get I can't help but hide
So ashamed of my body and voice
There are boundaries we pass in spite of the war
With a glory that reigns in his life
He is also so much that he is not
But these things they don't see
And she doesn't see me
There are things we can change if we just choose to fight
But the walls of injustice are high
Like the first drop of sun from the sky
And I know she's a queen who deserves a king
Someone other than me
I've walked the jungle
Fought a lion with bare hands
The Prince of Darkness
I've crossed the desert
Never feared for my own
The one thing that I'm scared of is losing hold of you
I get the shivers down my spine
Feel my body turning blue
The feeling is so frightening
It's driving me insane
The one thing that I'm scared of...
The one thing that I'm scared of is losing hold of you
I get the shivers down my spine
The feeling is so frightening
It's driving me insane
The one thing that I'm scared of...
Because you're always there
Sometimes we all get scared
The one thing that I'm scared of is losing hold of you
I get the shivers down my spine
Feel my body turning blue
The feeling is so frightening
It's driving me insane
The one thing that I'm scared of...
The one thing that I'm scared of is losing hold of you
I get the shivers down my spine
The feeling is so frightening
It's driving me insane
The one thing that I'm scared of...
The one thing that I'm scared of is losing hold of you
I get the shivers down my spine
Feel my body turning blue
The feeling is so frightening
It's driving me insane
The one thing that I'm scared of...
The one thing that I'm scared of is losing hold of you
I get the shivers down my spine
Feel my body turning blue
The feeling is so frightening
It's driving me insane
The one thing that I'm scared of...
The one thing that I'm scared of is losing hold of you
I get the shivers down my spine
Feel my body turning blue
The feeling is so frightening
It's driving me insane
The one thing that I'm scared of...
The one thing that I'm scared of is losing hold of you
I get the shivers down my spine
Feel my body turning blue
The feeling is so frightening
It's driving me insane
The one thing that I'm scared of...
The one thing that I'm scared of is losing hold of you
I get the shivers down my spine
Feel my body turning blue
The feeling is so frightening
It's driving me insane
The one thing that I'm scared of...
No matter what the people may say
Could take you to the top
You know you gotta throw fear away
Together we can make it
I can see eternity is in your eyes
With every chance you take
The start of something new
Calling out a new beginning
People with imagination
Everywhere a celebration
Living out our own destiny
The beat will last forever
You know we gotta groove into the light
Tonight will be the night that
Break it down baby yeah
I can see eternity is in your eyes
With every chance you take
The start of something new
Calling out a new beginning
People with imagination
Everywhere a celebration
Feel the fire burn within your soul
Forever we can take the
Music through the night
Calling out a new beginning
People with imagination
Everywhere a celebration
Calling out a new beginning
People with imagination
Everywhere a celebration
Calling out a new beginning
People with imagination
Everywhere a celebration
It's like I've known you in some other lifetime.
We're part of the great plan.
Like two stars the shine.
Now I don't have to pretend.
I can't believe we're living the dream
We finally made it through the fire.
Kissing the loneliness goodbye yeah.
I've been waiting for you all my life
Anticipating with ever dream ever night.
Destiny's moment we all share in time love is the message.
I've tried but I can't understand what all the fuss is about
I wish that I could be the man that you wanted me to be
I wish I was perfect and God knows I try
But everything I do just tears your heart in two
I never thought that being lovers meant that we can't be friends
If only I could understand what makes you feel it's the end
I wish I was perfect and God knows I try
Just tears your heart in two
It's not the way things used to be
Can you remember yesterdays
We used to smile without a care
Whenever you and I were near
Everything I do tears your heart in two
I wish I was perfect and God knows I try
But everything I do just tears your heart in two
Please don't say a word
Maybe I won't remember the words I have not heard
But I don't want the truth to haunt my memory
It's never too late to relight the fire
It never stopped burning for me
How is it now that I can tell you I love you
How is it only now that it's too late
So you'll take the smiles from all of our years
You gave me more than love
But never thought I cared
My feelings were all for you
Although it did not show
It's never too late to relight the fire
It never stopped burning for me
How is it only now that it's too late
So you'll take the smiles from all of our years
And I'll take the tears
But I'm hoping the pain will heal in time
How is it now that I can tell you I love you
What can I do the love that we had is torn in two
So you'll take the smiles from all of our years
And I'll take the tears
Have you seen your sunset
Fade beneath a raincloud
Have you ever chased your dreams away
Did you ever think that
Life was just a highway
A never ending road of lonely days
There are times we cry
And reach out to the sky
For the strength we need
To hold our head up high
All we have to do now
And all we have to do now
We all need each other
To live as one in love
Have you seen a sunrise
Promising you daylight
When all you need is shelter from the storm
Did you ever feel like
Love was just an island
You can't survive on love on your own ooh
There are times when I
For the strength I need
To hold my head up high
If we push aside the blame
For the tears and the pain
You know love can rain
And the world will smile again
If we push aside the blame
For the tears and the pain
You know love can rain
And the world will smile again
The world will smile again
All we have to do now
And all we have to do now
We all need each other
You said that love was just a state of mind
A puzzle made of pieces you can't find
But for me you never really had the time
And everything that you meant to me
Is written in the pages of my history
But it's over now as far as I can see
Things are so different now you're gone
I thought it'd be easy I was wrong
And now I'm caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new
All I can think about is you
And now I'm caught in the middle
Thoughts of you are in my mind always
Things are so different now you're gone
I thought it'd be easy I was wrong
And now I'm caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new
All I can think about is you
And now I'm caught in the middle
Things are so different now you're gone
I thought it'd be easy I was wrong
And now I'm caught in the middle
Even know I am with someone new
All I can think about is you
And now I'm caught in the middle
Things are so different now you're gone
I thought it'd be easy I was wrong
And now I'm caught in the middle
Even know I am with someone new
All I can think about is you
When you're down and out
I think of all I have
She never thought about it
Then threw it all away
Now it seems so wasted
Wish she could turn back time
Now she's down on her knees to pray
Begging please make it good
She will do what it takes to change
Someone please make it good
When you're down and out
For all she used to be
To turn her life around
To take back yesterday
When you're on your own
Welcome to your revolution
What you dream is what you see
There's no rules no regulations
Let the music set you free
There's a chill in the air
Looks like the winter is returning
You know I have to stay
Until I find a way to get through this
Nothing ventured nothing gained
Now there's no healing without some kind of pain
I know the sunshine on the other side
Won't let the storm roll over me
Set down these walls once and for all and set me free
I left it all to chance
Maybe the odds were all against me
Now it's out of my hands but I will see it through if you let me
Nothing ventured nothing gained
And there's no healing without some kind of pain
I know the sunshine on the other side
Won't let the storm roll over me
Set down these walls once and for all and set me free
When the truth behind the lies
All the dreams we left to die
Were just rivers running dry
I know the sunshine on the other side
Won't let the storm roll over me
Set down these walls once and for all and set me free
I know the sunshine on the other side
Won't let the storm roll over me
Set down these walls once and for all and set me free
But I'll be home real soon
Girl don't start to cry
It's a lonely ride on a midnight train
I'm counting down the days till I'm home again
How can I sing when my words have run dry
How can I smile with a tear in my eye
Summer's so lost with raining in June
That's how it feels when I'm missing you.
Oh yeah... hey baby ooh ooh
Now time ain't healing
How I wish you were here
It's a lonely ride on the midnight train
I'm counting down the days till I'm home again
How can I sing when my words have run dry
How can I smile with a tear in my eye
Summer's so lost with raining in June
That's how it feels when I'm missing You.
I've never met a girl who was so damn sweet
Can't wait to see you again ooh
I never had a love that was so complete
And you know that I'll be dreaming till then
How can I sing when my words have run dry
How can I smile with a tear in my eye
Summer's so lost with raining in June
That's how it feels when I'm missing you
Say yeah... when I'm missing you
Summer's so lost with raining in June
Say you can't take no more and you wanna go home
When I see tears roll down your face... oh no
Oh you got me going round and round
Yeah you got my life and turned it upside down
You make it going round and round in circles
We keep covering the same old ground
Yeah we keep going around and I got to get out
This ain't what love is about
The clocks keep on turning
There's one way to cross this river
But I don't know if I can deliver
I feel broke I'm down on my knees
We can't go on like this
Yeah we keep going around and round in circles
We keep covering the same old ground
This ain't what love is all about
This ain't what love is about
The crazy things I heard you say I'm mad about you all the same
I never really saw the crime Yet went ahead and served my time
I never met someone like you before But sometimes that is not enough
I must be crazy for leaving you Must be crazy for feeling blue
I will regret this chosen mind I never wanna see you cry
I care about you endlessly you deserve a deeper love than me
I don't know if I'll make it on my own But I tried so hard to let it go
And I can't hide this feeling
And I know that I will miss you like a fool But there's something in my life
And I can't hide this feeling I must be crazy for leaving you
Must be crazy for feeling blue But my heart lately has been untrue
When you feel the dream is over
Feel the world is on your shoulders
And you lost the strength to carry on
Even though the walls may crumble
And you find you always stumble through
Remember never to surrender to the dark
You will see that's not the way
And if you need to find a way back
Feel you're on the wrong track
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
You'll be stronger with each tear that you cry
Then you'll learn to fly
The truth is your possession
You will see the doors are open
If you only dare to hope and you
Will find a way to fight
The fears that kept you down
You will see that's not the way
And if you need to find a way back
Feel you're on the wrong track
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
You'll be stronger with each tear that you cry
Then you'll learn to fly
Looking at your situation
There's so much that you can do
This is just an observation
In the end it's up to you
The future's in your hands
And if you need to find a way back
Feel you're on the wrong track
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
You'll be stronger with each tear that you cry
Then you'll learn to fly
This punky club was spinning
Fores off a funky tee
I'm on the floor and she was watching me
With my back against the wall I played it casually
On the hole of some dirty trumpet
I had to say something
Let me take you to a place I know
Right beside the dirty little picture show.
But I'm not what you need.
Nothing comes for free.
As soon as she got me alone
And started taking off all her clothes
To Lady Paris singing
And now I was jacking her up all night
With a lethal injection
Was so close to perfection
Let me take you to a place I know
Right beside the dirty little picture show.
But I'm not what you need.
And nothing comes for free.
Talking sweet just to meet your demands.
See you delight as you stealing my night.
Just to play it straight into my hands.
Let me take you baby.
Let me take you baby.
Let me take you to a place I know
Right beside the dirty little picture show.
But I'm not what you need.
And nothing comes for free.
Let me take you to a place I know
Right beside the dirty little picture show.
But I'm not what you need.
And nothing comes for free.
Another picture on the wall
Another life I used to live
Another me that was untrue
With every memory of you
Another moment lost in time
You talked of love and I agreed
So many chances passed us by
And now we've lost the strength to try
Your love was never mine to keep
We can't hold on we're losing track
So where's the road to take us back
And how did we forget what we believed
And if the love has gone
And if you just can't find it in yourself to carry on
And if you had to leave
Then take my life forever
With every night I lie awake
With every day we grow apart
Is there a promise we can't break
We never learn from our mistakes
We can't hold on we're losing track
So where's the road to take us back
And how did we forget what we believed
And if the love has gone
And if you just can't find it in yourself to carry on
And if you had to leave
Then take my life forever
Don't look back on yesterday
Think of what tomorrow holds
Without you it feels so wrong
And if the love has gone
And if you just can't find it in yourself to carry on
And if you had to leave
Then take my life forever
Nobody waiting and no one to hold
She's holding her own
Stares at the mirror to find his own face
Picks out the pieces he hides from within
We're gonna make it through the night
We're gonna make it through the night
There's faith in disguise
There's no more secrets to shadow with lies
She swallows her pride
Just let it in and believe
We're gonna make it through the night
We're gonna make it through the night
Maybe today or maybe tomorrow
Guess the hands of fate
Been making you wait too long
I know the way to forget all your sorrow
Be the first in line to admit that you were wrong
We're gonna make it through the night
We're gonna make it through the night
Gonna make it through the night now baby
Gonna make it through the night now baby
Gonna make it through the night now baby
We're gonna make it through the night
We're gonna make it through the night
Sorry for making you cry
But baby I need to be strong
And I need to move on with my life
You know it's not that I don't care
So don't make me feel bad
Baby you know all the reasons
I made my decisions in life
Now a girl's gotta do
What a girl's gotta do
And a boy has to become a man
And I'm sorry for saying
But it's love that I need
And that love I just can't get from you
It's funny how things turned around
I first looked in your eyes
Although it's so soon this I know
I'll never be on my own
And I will cherish this love ever more
You know it's not easy to do
Turning my back on me and you
But baby I need someone there
Who will love me and care for my life
Smiles they turned into tears
Baby this cannot be right
So I'll turn down the light
What a boy's gotta do
And a girl has to do what she can
And I'm sorry for saying
But it's love that I need
And that love I just can't get from you
It's funny how things turn around
I first looked in your eyes
Although it's so soon this I know
I'll never be on my own
And I will cherish this love ever more
And everything that could gone wrong
Has gone wrong at some time
Now I can see the light
It was love at first sight
And I'm not gonna let this girl go
It's funny how things turn around
I first looked in your eyes
Although it's so soon this I know
I'll never be on my own
And I will cherish this love ever more
Looking back on yesterday
Memories won't fade away
I can't forget the love we made
No use looking to the past
We both knew it wouldn't last
But it was fun we had a blast
Say do you remember on the first of December
When we were riding on the backseat
They don't have to know
Breaking rules we always would
Doing things we never should
We were so bad but it felt so good
Do you remember say do you remember
I wonder where you are tonight
But I know that you'll be all right
Say do you remember on the first of December
When we were riding on the backseat
Turned the radio on and played our favorite song
Looking back on yesterday
Memories won't fade away
I can't forget the love we made
Say do you remember on the first of December
When we were riding on the backseat
Turned the radio on and played our favorite song
They don't have to know
Let me feel your embrace
Let me see in your eyes
That you won't say goodbye
Just tell me how you feel
I don't know what you're thinking anymore
Then tell me how you feel
That your love is for real
You'd hold me in your arms where I belong
So while I'm feeling strong
I sing you one last song
Let me ask time has passed
Do you feel this could last
I love you way too much
To wanna be the one who brings you down
Then tell me how you feel
That your love is for real
You'd hold me in your arms where I belong
So while I'm feeling strong
I sing you one last song
One last song I sing for you
This time it's for real
I never come to you like this
Expecting you to turn my kiss
Then tell me how you feel
That your love is for real
You'd hold me in your arms where I belong
So while I'm feeling strong
I sing you one last song
I sing you one last song
You said you need room this evening
Till you begged me to stay
Promised to please me
Then you take it away
The fire's fading baby stoke it up
And lady roll up your sleeves
Why can't you tell me that we're breaking up
And not I need space to breathe
If you can't wait any longer
You think time will make you stronger
You used to keep me up till the morning
Keeping me warm until I had to be gone
And now you can't find no room in your head
To say you got out of bed
Or that my coffee ain't on
The door was open till you locked it up
And then you threw out the key
Why can't you tell me that we're breaking up
And not I need space to breath
If you can't wait any longer
You think time will make you stronger
If you can't wait any longer
You think time will make you stronger
If you can't wait any longer
You think time will make you stronger
But it's over now as far as I can see
You said that love was just a state of mind
A puzzle made of pieces you can't find
But for me you never really had the time
And everything that you meant to me
Is written in the pages of my history
But it's over now as far as I can see
Things are so different now you're gone
I thought it'd be easy I was wrong
And now I'm caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new
All I can think about is you
And now I'm caught in the middle
Thoughts of you are in my mind always
Things are so different now you're gone
I thought it'd be easy I was wrong
And now I'm caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new
All I can think about is you
And now I'm caught in the middle
Things are so different now you're gone
I thought it'd be easy I was wrong
And now I'm caught in the middle
Even know I am with someone new
All I can think about is you
And now I'm caught in the middle
Things are so different now you're gone
I thought it'd be easy I was wrong
And now I'm caught in the middle
Even know I am with someone new
All I can think about is you
Someone's come and taken me
Where I don't wanna go
Exactly what I have to do
In order to be there for you
When you are feeling low
And all the things we ever wanted
Were once yours and mine
Now I know we can revive it
All the love we left...
And every time I close my eyes
That every time I hold
The sweetest thing my heart
And I have never felt this way
I gave your love away
I've fallen from my destiny
You and I were meant to be
I've thrown it all away
It's time for me to carry on
But baby I just can't go on
Without you by my side
And all the things we ever wanted
Were once yours and mine
Now I know we can revive it
All the love we left...
And every time I close my eyes
That every time I hold
The sweetest thing my heart
And I have never felt this way
I gave your love away
All the pain we feel inside
And now I've let you down
Now I promise you forever
I will be the best I can
Now I know we can revive it
All the love we left...
And every time I close my eyes
That every time I hold
The sweetest thing my heart
And I have never felt this way
Since I gave your love away
And every time I close my eyes
That every time I hold
The sweetest thing my heart
And I have never felt this way
I don't know what I'm to say
Today's another day to find you
I'll be coming for you love okay
I'll be gone in a day or two
So needless to say at odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
It's so much better to be safe than sorry
I'll be gone in a day or two
You're all the things I've got to remember
I'll be coming for you anyway
I'll be gone in a day or two
I'll be gone in a day or two
It's like I've known you in some other lifetime.
We're part of the great plan.
Like two stars the shine.
Now I don't have to pretend.
I can't believe we're living the dream
We finally made it through the fire.
Kissing the loneliness goodbye yeah.
I've been waiting for you all my life
Anticipating with ever dream ever night.
Destiny's moment we all share in time love is the message.
I can still remember the time you were there
You're never never gonna keep your promises
You're never never gonna keep your promises
You said you'd changed
It's something I won't live to see
Can appear to be so real
And yet turn out to be a fantasy
Never gonna keep your promises
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
When you're the same old brand new you
You're never never gonna keep your promises
You're never never gonna keep your promises
I guess we're through
Is this the way it has to be
But I've got better things to do than Let you walk all over me
Never gonna keep your promises
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
When you're the same old brand new you
I can still remember the time you were there
You're never never gonna keep your promises
You're never never gonna keep your promises
Never gonna keep your promises
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
When you're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
You say you're gonna work it out
Then you say you're having doubts.
But then you go and stay
You're calling me day and night
Saying he don't treat you right.
Then you always turn around
And give him one more try.
Baby you know it isn't fair
You expect me to be there.
But we never get nowhere.
I'll make a long story short
Time to make up your mind girl.
Stop telling me you need more time
Tired of the same old line.
Better let him know it's time too go your moving on.
Baby you don't know how close
Tell me if I have your heart.
Baby you know it isn't fair
You expect me to be there.
But we never get nowhere.
If your sure that you really love me.
Out the door if you still don't know.
You belong with me. What you gonna do
And as I look into your eyes
I see an angel in disguise
Sent from God above for me to love
And as I hold your body near
I'll see this month through to a year
And then forever on till life is gone
I'll keep your loving near
And now I've finally found my way
To lead me down this lonely road
All I have to do is follow you
To lighten off my load
You treat me like a rose
You give me room to grow
You shone the light of love on me
And gave me air so I can breathe
You open doors that close
In a world where anything goes
You give me strength so I stand tall
And when I feel like hope is gone
You give me strength to carry on
Each time I look at you there's something new
To keep our loving strong
I hear you whisper in my ear
All of the words I long to hear
Of how you'll always be here next to me
To wipe away my tears
And now I've finally found my way
To lead me down this lonely road
All I have to do is follow you
To lighten off my load
You treat me like a rose
You give me room to grow
You shone the light of love on me
And gave me air so I can breathe
You open doors that close
In a world where anything goes
You give me strength so I stand tall
And though the seasons change
Our love remains the same
When the sunshine turns to rain
You treat me like a rose
You give me room to grow
You shone the light of love on me
And gave me air so I can breathe
You open doors that close
In a world where anything goes
You give me strength so I stand tall
You give me strength so I stand tall
Within this bed of earth
Could be the way you freed my mind
You precious touch caressed my soul
You gave me everything I need
And you said I turned my back on
You said I'm not the only one for you
Please give it one more try for the sake of our love
I can't live one more day without you in my arms
Could be the days and nights so wild
Could be the times I wasn't there
And all the nights we didn't share
And you said I turned my back on
You said I'm not the only one for you
Please give it one more try for the sake of our love
I can't live one more day without you in my arms
So lost without you as my guide
Please give it one more try for the sake of our love
I can't live one more day without you in my arms
But I'll be home real soon
Girl don't start to cry
It's a lonely ride on a midnight train
I'm counting down the days till I'm home again
How can I sing when my words have run dry
How can I smile with a tear in my eye
Summer's so lost with raining in June
That's how it feels when I'm missing you.
Oh yeah... hey baby ooh ooh
Now time ain't healing
How I wish you were here
It's a lonely ride on the midnight train
I'm counting down the days till I'm home again
How can I sing when my words have run dry
How can I smile with a tear in my eye
Summer's so lost with raining in June
That's how it feels when I'm missing You.
I've never met a girl who was so damn sweet
Can't wait to see you again ooh
I never had a love that was so complete
And you know that I'll be dreaming till then
How can I sing when my words have run dry
How can I smile with a tear in my eye
Summer's so lost with raining in June
That's how it feels when I'm missing you
Say yeah... when I'm missing you
Summer's so lost with raining in June
There's magic within you
There's magic in everything you do
Magic me to the place where dreams come true
I get off on the crazy things we do
I'm jealous of every guy that looks at you
The game that you're playing
You gotta let me down or see it through
You're straight from a movie
You can't hide the love inside
When you feel the dream is over
Feel the world is on your shoulders
And you lost the strength to carry on
Even though the walls may crumble
And you find you always stumble through
Remember never to surrender to the dark
You will see that's not the way
And if you need to find a way back
Feel you're on the wrong track
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
You'll be stronger with each tear that you cry
Then you'll learn to fly
The truth is your possession
You will see the doors are open
If you only dare to hope and you
Will find a way to fight
The fears that kept you down
You will see that's not the way
And if you need to find a way back
Feel you're on the wrong track
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
You'll be stronger with each tear that you cry
Then you'll learn to fly
Looking at your situation
There's so much that you can do
This is just an observation
In the end it's up to you
The future's in your hands
And if you need to find a way back
Feel you're on the wrong track
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
You'll be stronger with each tear that you cry
Then you'll learn to fly
When you're down and out
I think of all I have
She never thought about it
Then threw it all away
Now it seems so wasted
Wish she could turn back time
Now she's down on her knees to pray
Begging please make it good
She will do what it takes to change
Someone please make it good
When you're down and out
For all she used to be
To turn her life around
To take back yesterday
When you're on your own
Welcome to your revolution
What you dream is what you see
There's no rules no regulations
Let the music set you free
Thanks for the times that you've given me
The memories are all in my mind.
And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud
And I love you... I love you...
When we are together the moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart
There's nothing to keep us apart
There's a chill in the air
Looks like the winter is returning
You know I have to stay
Until I find a way to get through this
Nothing ventured nothing gained
Now there's no healing without some kind of pain
I know the sunshine on the other side
Won't let the storm roll over me
Set down these walls once and for all and set me free
I left it all to chance
Maybe the odds were all against me
Now it's out of my hands but I will see it through if you let me
Nothing ventured nothing gained
And there's no healing without some kind of pain
I know the sunshine on the other side
Won't let the storm roll over me
Set down these walls once and for all and set me free
When the truth behind the lies
All the dreams we left to die
Were just rivers running dry
I know the sunshine on the other side
Won't let the storm roll over me
Set down these walls once and for all and set me free
I know the sunshine on the other side
Won't let the storm roll over me
Set down these walls once and for all and set me free
The love we feel inside
The words we need to say
Have always walked alone
But now that you're here with me
There'll always be a place that I can go
Has started to unfold
When you're next to me
I can see the greatest story
Now my life is blessed with
Somebody to keep the dream alive
The dream I found in you
I always thought that love would be
The strangest thing to me
That I found my place in heaven by your side
I'd walk a thousand miles to hear you
Now that I have finally found the
One who will be there for me eternally
Suddenly our destiny has started
When you're next to me I can
See the greatest story love has ever
Now my life is blessed with
Somebody to keep the dream alive
The dream I found in you
I always thought that love would be
The strangest thing to me
Found my place in heaven by your side
That I found my place in heaven by
The greatest story love has ever told
Now my life is blessed with
Somebody to keep the dream alive
The dream I found in you
I always thought that love would be
The strangest thing to me
Found my place in heaven by your side
Now my life is blessed with
Somebody to keep the dream alive
The dream I found in you
I always thought that love would be
The strangest thing to me
Summertime of our lives
Hey girl the feeling is right
Hot sand holding your hand
We'll have the time of our lives
Blue skies sea in your eyes
Let the groove move my people all around me
We'll have the time of our lives
Sugar candy cherry world
There's a boy for every girl
Sugar candy cherry world
We'll have the time of our lives
Are you up for it get down with it
Are you up for it get down with it
Are you up for it get down with it
Maybe I don't even exist
So I'll stay anonymous
It's over and the situations shrouded in shame
And they say it's down to us
Till it's starting or ending
I'll never get tired of your lies
But what you got to visualize
We either get high or go dry
Either get high or go dry
I see you're playing that song again
You never show your hand
You keep it all inside yourself
And cry to no one else
But I'll catch your tears
I'll never get tired of your lies
We either get high or go dry
We either get high or go dry
Either get high or go dry
You say this love will see another day
But at least tonight you'll be mine
But what you got to visualize
Either get high or go dry
Either get high or go dry
Either get high or go dry
You just found heaven
It's been a while since you needed a shoulder to cry on
Now you're coming to me for a helping hand
It's just ain't right
The way you're letting her down
It's the same old story time after time
Take a look at your life
You just found heaven
You just can't get it right
But I'll be here for you my friend
Then you leave it to me to try and turn it around
It's the same old story time after time
You just found heaven
But I'll be here for you my friend
I can't believe you did it again
You're only breaking your heart like this
Just tearing you apart and then
You're right back where you started
It's the same old story time after time
You just found heaven
But I'll be here for you my friend
Take a look at your life
You just found heaven
But I'll be here for you my friend
When you're down and out
I think of all I have
She never thought about it
Then threw it all away
Now it seems so wasted
Wish she could turn back time
Now she's down on her knees to pray
Begging please make it good
She will do what it takes to change
Someone please make it good
When you're down and out
For all she used to be
To turn her life around
To take back yesterday
When you're on your own
Welcome to your revolution
What you dream is what you see
There's no rules no regulations
Let the music set you free
I can still remember the time you were there
You're never never gonna keep your promises
You're never never gonna keep your promises
You said you'd changed
It's something I won't live to see
Can appear to be so real
And yet turn out to be a fantasy
Never gonna keep your promises
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
When you're the same old brand new you
You're never never gonna keep your promises
You're never never gonna keep your promises
I guess we're through
Is this the way it has to be
But I've got better things to do than Let you walk all over me
Never gonna keep your promises
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
When you're the same old brand new you
I can still remember the time you were there
You're never never gonna keep your promises
You're never never gonna keep your promises
Never gonna keep your promises
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
When you're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
I wish that I could go some place
Where nobody knows you now
This heart it weighs a ton
Some memories you can't escape
And nobody shows you how
Yet I still wait for you
Living in this state for you
I'll wear these scars for you
I'll reignite the spark for you
I don't want friends around
Living in this state for you
I'll wear these scars for you
I'll reignite the spark for you
A sinner becomes a saint
Believers can lose their faith
We learn from our mistakes
So I still wait for you
Living in this state for you
I'll wear these scars for you
I'll reignite the spark for you
I can feel that the wheels in motion
In this life in this song time and again
Looking back there's a new reflection
Now I know what you give is what you get
In the end it's all or nothing
And I feel I'm ready now
So I try to be the answer
Now I bet that your ears are burning
With three words on the tip of my tongue
I just hope that your heart is open
So that I can undo what I've done
In the end it's all or nothing
And I feel I'm ready now
So I try to be the answer
Like a star it's so hard to reach you
Not enough just to call you a friend
And I know that I don't deserve you
But I don't wanna lose you again oh
In the end it's all or nothing
And I feel I'm ready now
So I try to be the answer
You are like the ocean
And your drowning knee
The sunrise casting shadow
I'm in love and so overrated
What am I supposed to do
I'm in love and feel so naked
What am I supposed to do
I'm in love and I hate it
I'm in love and I hate it
Sometimes I feel spineless
I can't stand up straight
And sometimes I'm so stupid
I make the same mistake
I'm in love And I hate it
Is there any way to reach you now
Sitting on the edge thinking out loud
Maybe there is something that you know
Something that only you know
I do it all for you if I could
The way it looks now from where I stood
Maybe there is something that you know
Something that only you know
Running away isn't the way
Get it if you don't give up
Running away isn't the way
Get it if you don't give up
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad enough
Take a little time think this through
See it from another point of view
Maybe there is somewhere that you go
Somewhere that only you go
Trying to move on all the way down
Waiting for your head to hit the ground
Whatever you're in we'll figure it out
Maybe there is something I do now
Running away isn't the way
Get it if you don't give up
Running away isn't the way
Get it if you don't give up
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad enough
It's all in your head
You can fight this illusion
You can fight this illusion
It's all in your head
You can fight this illusion
It's all in your head
You can fight this illusion
Running away isn't the way
Get it if you don't give up
Running away isn't the way
Get it if you don't give up
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad enough
Photographs in a card board box
Remind me I can't turn back the clocks
So far now from the starting blocks
I still don't know what this key unlocks
Made you give it away
There's nothing left to say
Nothing in common now
Nothing in common now
There's nothing to talk about
Like 2 ships sailing into
Different directions now
We've Nothing In Common now
To hammer out the dents
No more sitting on a broken fence
It's to rebuild my confidence
Made you give it away
Nothing in common now
Nothing in common now
There's nothing to talk about
Like 2 ships sailing into
Different directions now
We've Nothing In Common now
Nice to see that you're doing well
You're happy now as far as I can tell
We soldier on with the hands we're dealt
We're strangers now to the way we felt
Nothing in common now
Nothing in common now
There's nothing to talk about
Like 2 ships sailing into
Different directions now
We've Nothing In Common now
I'm gonna take this chance to be up all night
I wanna fix this up just the way you like
I wanna shake the weight of the world that's right
I gotta make the most of the soul street eye
We got ten more minutes to go I said
We got ten more minutes before we go
I heard it on the radio
You know I need somebody to love me yes
You know that I won't settle for second best
We gotta live like that ignore the rest
So if they all go east then we'll go west
You know I dance my life to a different beat
And I like it here on the edge of my seat
Now the stage is set and we're alone
Where we'll end up later we don't know
I heard it on the radio
And if it gets too crowded then may I suggest
And when they all go east then we'll go west
Come on let's go go go
Where we'll end up we don't know
I heard it on the radio
I heard it on the radio
You've already said too much
Pick and collect your stuff
You can't keep what you're throwing away
Our love is six feet underground
Our love is six feet underground
You've already said too much
Come back and collect your stuff
You can't keep what you're throwing away
Our love is six feet underground
Our love is six feet underground
There's no way back this time
So we gotta leave it all behind
You can't keep what you're throwing away
Our love is six feet underground
Our love is six feet underground
You can't keep what you're throwing away
Our love is six feet underground
Our love is six feet underground
You can't keep what you're throwing away
Our love is six feet underground
Our love is six feet underground
I know a girl with a broken smile
He's been hurting her for quite a while
I've got a friend with a heart of gold
He loved his wife even when he was told
I guess in life you don't always reap what you sow
It doesn't make much sense but I'd like to know
Why do good things happen to bad people
Why do bad things happen to good people
I've seen a man working all his life
Lose his job to a new device
Who built an empire stepping on the weak
I guess in life you don't always reap what you sow
It doesn't make much sense but I'd like to know
Why do good things happen to bad people
Why do bad things happen to good people
Why do good things happen to bad people
Why do bad things happen to good people
Some of us were born to break
The slightest knock is all it takes
I've tried to thicken up my skin
I'm having trouble fitting in
Now all my life I have learned
It's me just me against the world
Now the world's moving faster
This could be a disaster
Is the change that I'm making
Worth the risk that I'm taking
Now the world's moving faster
This could be ever after
I hide behind the songs I wrote
Will all my fears be confirmed
Is it me just me against the world
Now the world's moving faster
This could be a disaster
Is the change that I'm making
Worth the risk that I'm taking
Now the world's moving faster
This could be ever after
As far as I am concerned
It's now you and me against the world
Now the world's moving faster
This could be a disaster
Is the change that I'm making
Worth the risk that I'm taking
Now the world's moving faster
This could be ever after
I meet someone the other day
It's good to see her face again
She's the one who got a way
Showed photos of her family
Soon to marry mum to be
She used to want all that with me
And she smiled and I laughed
Then I imagined if I didn't take that fight
And I think that I've just seen
The Life That Could Have Been
She's happy now and that's a fact
And who am I to mess with that
So I won't try to get her back
Still I can't help but think about
All the things that I'm without
But I wave the white flag
Then I imagined if I didn't take that fight
And I think that I've just seen
The Life That Could Have Been
And as she was walking away
Turn back and hesitate
Look at me as if to say
I imagined if you didn't take that fight
Then I imagined if I didn't take that fight
And it's the strangest thing
And I think that I've just seen
The Life That Could Have Been
Come around to mine won't you
Wanna spend some time with you
Cut the chord and shoot the breeze
Wanna improvise with you
Put the world to rights with you
Let me put your mind at ease
Reminisce and laugh with me
Go for broke and paint with me
Come on roll the dice with me
Flip the bird to life with me
We can turn this all around
And there's more than enough to spare
Climb the wall you've been facing
Catch the wave you've been chasing
We've got something to live for now
Come around to mine won't you
Wanna spend some time with you
Cut the chord and shoot the breeze
And there's more than enough to spare
I miss your breathing
When sleep doesn't come
I can't help pretending you'll be home
I can't face the future
Now you're in the past
Seems all of the best things never last
But there's no use in crying
There's no point denying
I'm waiting for daylight to come
They say I get through this
But how could they know
How can I make it on my own
Your here in the shadow
And I hear you whisper in the dark
There's no use in crying
There's no point denying
I'm waiting for daylight to come
I don't wanna let you go
I'll wake up for all I know
But there's no use in crying
There's no point denying
Guess my dinner is in dark tonight
Bringing in my ears till morning light
Baby just wanna have fun tonight
I would never tell you lie
No I'm not that kind of guy
I can take it another day
Cool it down now before you blow your top
I guess the dogs back sleeps in my spot
I would never tell you lie
No I'm not that kind of guy
No I'm not that kind of guy
I would never tell you lie
No I'm not that kind of guy
When you walk right by
And I wanna say something but
You don't see me if I gave you my compass
Then would you be more like Christopher Columbus
Hey now I've gotta tell you
No I'm bursting to tell you
I can't keep it inside
But I may not be necessarily
What you're looking for
But oh who knows what fate has in store
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Come knock knock on my door
I'm feeling vulnerable my heart's uncovered
I'll still be waiting
I'll keep a look out until your ship comes sailing in
Will you ever be mine
Hey now how can I show you
I'm bursting to tell you
I can't keep it inside
But I may not be necessarily
What you're looking for
But oh who knows what fate has in store
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Oh come knock knock on my door
Have you been discovered
I wish I'd been more like Christopher Columbus
But I may not be necessarily
What you're looking for
But oh who knows what fate has in store
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Everybody needs somebody
I need you you you In the morning
I need you you you When my soul's on fire
I feel a little sad inside
When my baby mistreats me
I never never never have a place to hide
I feel a little sad inside
When my baby mistreats me
I never never never have a place to hide
You know people when you do find that somebody
Signify your feelings with every gentle caress
Because it's so important to have that special somebody
Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody to love
He had a beautiful brogue both rich and sweet.
And to rise in the world he carried a hod.
Now Tim had a sort of the tippler's way.
With a love of the liquor poor Tim was born
And to help him on with his work each day.
Wasn't it the truth I told you
He fell off the ladder and broke his skull
So they carried him home his corpse to wake.
They rolled him up in a nice clean sheet
With a gallon of whiskey at his feet
And a case of the blue star at his head.
Wasn't it the truth I told you
His friends assembled at the wake.
Then Biddy O'Brien began to cry.
Wasn't it the truth I told you
Then Maggie O'Connor took up the job.
And Biddy she gave her a belt in the gob.
Civil war did then engage.
Shillelagh law was all the rage.
And a row and a ruction soon began.
Wasn't it the truth I told you
Wasn't it the truth I told you
Wasn't it the truth I told you
Many different ways so don't worry if some words don't fit
Go tell I said suck our dick
Tell me this and that
I'll tell you plenty facts
Friends front in front of me
Your foolish for believing them
That's what I'm saying
Go tell I said suck our dicks
Bring on over all your friends
I'll put it to an end
In my face all the stories changing
I'll blow up all their spots
I'll let you see that they just hating
This is how I make it stop
Go tell I said suck our dicks
Bout what your girlfriends said
It makes me wanna punch you in your head
Don't listen to your friends
But ain't saying nothing
They steady fronting every time that I confront them
Swinging on the poles
I guess you must be stupid
Here's your last chance to make this choice
Then my mind is chose
When I was younger so much younger than today
And now these days are gone
I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind
I've opened up the doors
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
Help me get my feet back on the ground
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you
Like I've never done before
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
Help me get my feet back on the ground
When I was younger so much younger than today
And now these days are gone
I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind
I've opened up the doors
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
Help me get my feet back on the ground
And as I look into your eyes
I see an angel in disguise
And as I hold your body near
I'll see this month through to a year
I'll keep your loving near
And now I've finally found my way
To lead me down this lonely road
To lighten up my load
You treat me like a rose
You give me room to grow
You shone the light of love on me
And gave me air so I can breathe
You open doors that close
In a world where anything goes
You give me strength so I stand tall
Within this bed of earth
And when I feel like hope is gone
You give me strength to carry on
Each time I look at you
There's something new
To keep our loving strong
I hear you whisper in my ear
All of the words I long to hear
Of how you'll always be
To wipe away my tears
And now I've finally found my way
To lead me down this lonely road
To lighten up my load
You treat me like a rose
You give me room to grow
You shone the light of love on me
And gave me air so I can breathe
You opened doors I closed
In a world where anything goes
You give me strength so I stand tall
Within this bed of earth
And though the seasons change
Our love remains the same
When the sunshine turns to rain
You treat me like a rose
You give me room to grow
You shone the light of love on me
And gave me air so I can breathe
You opened doors I closed
In a world where anything goes
You give me strength so I stand tall
Within this bed of earth
You give me strength so I stand tall
Within this bed of earth
Hey I've been watching you
Every little thing you do
Every time I see you pass
I've tried to page you twice
But I see you roll your eyes
Wish I could make it real
I hear your friends talk about me
You really blow my mind
I just want you to know
I wanna be your Romeo
Girl you got me on my knees
Too far to turn around
So I'm gonna stand my ground
Gimme just a little bit of hope
I hear your friends talk about me
You really blow my mind
I just want you to know
I wanna be your Romeo
I know you really want me
I hear your friends talk about me
You don't have to say forever
For us to hang together
So hear me when I say
I spent another night
Wondering why do I need to lie
Pretending I would miss you all the time
I still allow my eyes to cry
Trying to forget a girl like you
I wish I'd asked you for a dance
The night we had our last romance
Then maybe we would still be dancing
If I'd asked you one more time
If you would be my valentine
Then maybe you would still be mine
Like a fool dreams you're lonely too
Recall the love that we once knew
I won't allow this dream to die
Trying to forget a girl like you
I wish I'd asked you for a dance
The night we had our last romance
Then maybe we would still be dancing
If I'd asked you one more time
If you would be my valentine
You might think that I won't make it on my own
Stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
I used to go with the flow
Stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
Stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
To day is just another day
But it's lost without you here with me
That's the price I have to pay
I never meant to hurt you
How can I ever really make it up to you
Please don't tell me it's to late
I wish I could say I'm sorry and make it all go away
How can I let you know how I feel for you
It's never easy to explain
How you feel when you're confronted with
Things you never really did
I hope your joy and happy means
And you're memories of who you where
I never meant to hurt you
How can I ever really make it up to you
Please don't tell me it's to late
I wish I could say I'm sorry and make it all go away
How can I let you know how I feel for you
How can I ever really make it up to you
Please don't tell me it's to late
I wish I could say I'm sorry and make it all go away
How can I let you know how I feel for you
I can feel myself moving
Closer to a dream that's waiting for me
And I can swim right under the ocean
If I have faith I know I can do it
If I work towards all my dreams
If I have faith I know I can make it
Ain't no hard work goes unrewarded I'm sure
There's no doubt that I will get there I'm certain
We were all born to shine
To give out a little light
And shine it on the world
And I can swim right under the ocean
If I have faith I know I can do it
If I work towards all my dreams
If I have faith I know I can make it
And I can swim right under the ocean
If I have faith I know I can do it
If I work towards all my dreams
Ain't no need to worry baby
Your the only one for me
No other kisses would do
I owe you stay with me
I been busy now I'm free
Put it together and you'll find love
Your the only one for me
There ain't no one else I need
I Will give my love to thee
Together we'll be for eternity
My love is far too deep
Without you I couldn't breathe
Together we'll be for eternity
Boy I am... so in love with you
And I wanna let you know that
I'm never gonna say goodbye
I'm never gonna leave your side
It feels so good the things that you do
That's why I am so in love with you
And I wanna let you know that
I'm never gonna say goodbye
I'm never gonna leave your side
Because you put me first no other man has put me first before
Because you cared for me no other man has cared like this before
Because you treat me right no other man could ever treat me like you do
With you baby down time.
And ask you if you want to...
With you baby down time.
Certainly talk to me...
With you baby down time.
So tell me when can we...
With you baby down time.
Your not here with me
Never thought that this could ever be
Oh I feel that I'm in love with you
You don't feel the same
I need you next to me
I seem to look at a picture
I know it's been awhile
Maybe you got a lady right now
But I gotta let you know
Oh I feel that I'm in love with you
You don't feel the same

Make me believe it's all for me
This is the world protecting me
As for tonight ill hold your hand
Forget about your lady
Find a way to leave I hope it so
I'm a lady that comes with no chances
That means if I spot a sign of trouble you're gone
I let the guys play my heart as if it was a toy
I'm gonna let you play the games on me
Because I got a better strategy
Boy your silly games won't get away with me
You're just another boot from the river
I'll find a better lover
There's fishes in the sea
Aw aw shake it shake shake it
Shake I am gonna shake for my love
Shake do that old school shake now let your back bones shake shake now let me see you shake it now
Pressed against my window pane
Cause rain drops will hide my teardrops and no one will ever know
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
But your love was the key to peace my mind
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
You make me feel so good inside
And I just want to be close to you
You make me fell so alive
Empty pizza boxes on the floor
Empty liquor bottle from before
You'll find your comfort in between the sheets
Wait to break it to the streets
Confidence just went out the window
Life is passing by and your poor soul is gone
Still procrastinating
Your work is over due
Say that you'll buy a big house
I've been trying to get to you
I've been trying to get through to you
Tell me if you hear me
Tell me if you're listening
I've been trying to get to you
I've been trying to get through to you
Tell me if you hear me
Tell me if you're listening
I fell my heart is beating faster
As you make your way closer
Don't feel the butterflies
They're small like fireflies
Cause whenever I look at you
A heat up in my heart just melts aside
They're small like fireflies
Cause whenever I look at you
A heat up in my heart just melts aside
I'm laughing with my friends
Don't feel the butterflies
They're small like fireflies
Cause whenever I look at you
A heat up in my heart just melts aside
They're small like fireflies
Cause whenever I look at you
A heat up in my heart just melts aside
You know that I want your love
I'm sure in time I'll let you know
You know that I want your love
I'm sure in time I'll let you know
Somebody told me that someone told them
That you was hanging with a girl named Kim say uh uh
Tell me this ain't true
You told me that your love was deeper than the sea
But I'm standing here looking really crazy
I'm feeling like a fool
Around with a hepper that's 5 foot 7
Miss Love E got nothing on me
My mom said I should leave it alone
But I'm too hurt to let it go
You gonna end up doing time
L O R E N A B O B B I T T
L O R E N A B O B B I T T
And you deserve so much better
But I just can't let you go
And I don't wanna take that shit for granted
And I don't wanna take that shit for granted
To forget the past and let it slide
But I know in my heart
I just can't handle the thought of losing you
And I don't wanna take that shit for granted
And I don't wanna take that shit for granted
And I don't wanna take that shit for granted
And I don't wanna take that shit for granted
But you know damn right you is wrong
You're running all over town
While your man waits around
At home thinking that you're with your girl
That you out here doing him dirty
Another man is giving his lady love
You said bob's your uncle
Bruce is your brother
You keep on telling them lies
You know you're somebody's wife
Now what makes you think
About all of them secrets you hold
Shit like this always hits the ground
That you out here doing him dirty
Another man is giving his lady love
You said bob's your uncle
Bruce is your brother
You keep on telling them lies
You know you're somebody's wife
Up with the man and ask you
Who was your friend and you said
You said bob's your uncle
Bruce is your brother
You keep on telling them lies
You know you're somebody's wife
Remember the days when we used to chill
We didn't have a care in the world
We used to laugh together
When we used to skip class together
I could never forget uh
Never forget my good friends
Take me back to the day when we used to play
Take me back to the day when we used to play
I swear it ain't hot like it used to be
When things were much better way back then
I could never forget uh
Never forget the time spent oh oh
When we were so young and our hearts would run free
I heard it's foolish to say
That things were better back in the day
But I swear it ain't the same
You know that they got it wrong with the change
Take me back just one time
When we were so young oh oh oh
What our love's all about
I would say our love is like a flower
With the petals pulled out
No one to try to put us down baby
Because I love you too much and
There's just some problems that we gotta work through time
There's not much time
We gotta get it together today
Can we get it back like
Can we get it back like
I know right now we're still together
But the fire and passion is gone
Because our love ain't the same
And every night I pray please god don't take my baby away
There's not much time
We gotta get it together today
Can we get it back like
Can we get it back like
You used to hold me real close
But nowadays it feels like slowly
Your love is fading far away
You used to hold me real close
But nowadays it feels like slowly
Your love is fading far away
Lately I've been thinking
Know I forgave you but I can't forget
Whenever I look up in the sky I'm like
It amounts to all the teardrops from my eyes
And this shit just won't go away
But it just won't leave me alone
I need you to stop right now
With my pockets full of stones
And a brick tied around my soul
Uh uh I'm not the same
Uh uh I'm not the same
Uh uh I'm not the same
You know I used to be a fighter
But ever since you came into my life
I can't find what's wrong from right
Oh you took the hope out of me
I can't find any joy in anything
And all of the things that I used to enjoy
I don't enjoy them no more
Uh uh I'm not the same
Uh uh I'm not the same
Uh uh I'm not the same
Everybody's wondering
The girl that they used to know
She don't live here no more
Uh uh I'm not the same
And I'm guessing you still think I still got that
And I'm guessing you still think you got it like that
Sitting at the fireplace
Forgetting everything I did in them old days
Like a coin to a packer with a hole
Cause you are a little late and your pockets is empty
You used to be my wind and I was your dust
I'll follow you everywhere you could thrust
The end of the day comes nigh
Now I know wrong from right
I remember the night you was walking
Hand in hand with that flimsy girl
And you made sure I'd end up feeling like it hits my bones
It took some time to open up my eyes
Now the grass is surely greener on the other side
And I'm guessing you still think I still got that
And I'm guessing you still think you got it like that
Sitting at the fireplace
Forgetting everything I did in them old days
It got too quiet so ended up falling falling falling
You don't miss your water until it runs dry
And I'm guessing you still think I still got that
And I'm guessing you still think you got it like that
Sitting at the fireplace
Forgetting everything I did in them old days
To be honest I was a little clueless
Didn't know that you'd end up being so heartless
I was mess when you left
Now you're over here thinking you could get it back
She's ambitious man she's viciously beautiful I never thought in my love I would ever give a damn but now I do she had a mission she had a vision to be with my man I could swear that I could see the twinkle in her eye she had a plan
Just told me that I can't get in
He said that it was closing
But he was only lying
I came to have a good time
But had me feeling like I wasn't good enough to come in
Hey big boy I guess you've got your cool shoes on
The girl with the smoky eyes dipped in the skewer reminiscing over mocking birds
She's a birdie that likes to mock and just talks talks talks
Because she thinks she perfect
And everyone to rock will think she's right
Well let me tell you something
That karma is a bitch
And when it comes to rock
You're gonna feel that chick
Hey big boy I guess you've got your cool shoes on
The ones that got chased out of town
The cats that always got put down
I promise you're gonna see your better days
I promise it won't always be this way
So let them fools believe that they could
Cause one day they're gonna walk in your shoes
Hey big boy I guess you've got your cool shoes on
Hey big boy I guess you've got your cool shoes on
Don't give a shit about what comes out your mouth
I do what feels comfortable
You ain't even been through the things that I've been through
Stop focusing on mine
I can do what the hell I like
Don't give a shit about what comes out your mouth
I do what feels comfortable
They say she was ugly and she ain't know that
I don't like the music and I think she's stupid
I wonder if you're strong enough to take my place
Don't give two shits about what comes out your mouth
I do what feels comfortable
I never thought it would be that hard
In with what I've been in love
All my life all I wanted to do was this nothing at all
None of you haters can replace it
None of you haters can take it from me
Every night I sit by the window
Crying like a wolf cause your love's gone
I didn't mean it when I said that I hate you
And even if you don't love me anymore
Forever and ever my heart will always remain with you
And I'll be crying fuck you you you
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
The thought of another is making me break down
I didn't mean it when I said it's over
Please don't say it's over
And even if you don't love me anymore
Forever and ever my heart will always remain with you
And I'll be crying fuck you you you
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
Howling at the moon and I hope that you can hear my call
Hoping that you will hear my call
If you don't love me I will fill another
They say love is blind but baby all I see
Is that you don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
Realized that things just ain't the same
But now my screws ain't really that loose
This relationship wasn't really that tied
Somewhere down the line you lost that body
Cause every day is a battle when it comes to love
You gotta put up a fight
You don't just give up your try
And I've been trying for too long
To get you to hold on
But I guess you don't love me anymore
If you don't love me I will fill another
They say love is blind but baby all I see
Is that you don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
Acting like you ain't really that face
But I swear baby in time
You bound to find that missing peace of mind
And when you find that I'm off to the next one
I'll be singing something about my new one
Said this thing is loving
How good he used to be
I gotta let go of memories
That keep me from leaving
If you don't love me I will fill another
They say love is blind but baby all I see
Is that you don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
I'm done with pretending that we're away
Better love and I can make my heart smile
See that's what you used to do
If you don't love me I will fill another
They say love is blind but baby all I see
Is that you don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
He can to try to please me and
He never leaves me alone
Always wanna call me on the phone
Tell me how much I mean to him
How I'm never gonna ever be leaving him
Love my man that's my man
Before his work his boys
Hes my chocolate daddy
Hes always by my side
Love my man that's my man
There lives an embodiment of manliness too beautiful to describe
His good looks are the greatest thing to come along since the invention of sliced bread
He's the most appealing person to whom has ever been given birth
His hot body is quite possibly the eighth wonder of the world
He's like a train to Pleasure City that's boarding on Track 3
Making good love like a walking sex factory
So check me out while some rhymes I flex
If being sexy was considered a crime
I'm the Canadian pope. I don't do dope
I once got busy with a soap on a rope
The most appealing person to whom has ever been given birth
We've got to do whatever it takes to keep the Almighty at bay
Keep God out of Canada
Keep God out of Canada
Keep God out of Canada
Keep God out of Canada
We captured a guy last week who we thought was God in disguise
Keep God out of Canada
Keep God out of Canada
Keep God out of Canada
Keep God out of Canada
You've gotta... Keep God out of Canada
Keep God out of Canada
Keep God out of Canada
Said she was coming to my hotel tonight
She just flew in on a flight
She got a new man at home
Because I can't treat her right
She said that I can't complain
Expensive tasting in wine
But need a shot on the side
Still trying to prove she the best for me
Push me down on the couch
And then she'll turn the lights out
Take off my clothes that I'm wearing around
Acting like she don't care
When I pick the phone up
When I say I gotta go love
Acting like she so hard
When I stand her ass up
Trying to get me back
Like it was a competition
Trying to make me mad
Still trying to prove she the best for me
Push me down on the couch
And then she'll turn the lights out
Take off my clothes that I'm wearing around
I don't know what to do
I can't believe it's true that
You can make me feel this way
I see it in your eyes
There's something that I've got to say
I just wanna tell you that I'm sorry
For all the things I've done to make you worry
And all the time I cared for you from the bottom of my heart
I will be yours if you'll be mine
I will be there till the end of time
I will be with you until the day that I die
I've been around the world
But no one can compare to you
It's really plain to see
That you belong to me
And I just wanna tell you that I'm sorry
For all the things I've done to make you worry
And all the time I cared for you from the bottom of my heart
I will be yours if you'll be mine
I will be there till the end of time
I will be with you until the day that I die
Crazy little party girl
Crazy little party girl
Always ready to dance
Everyone needs a little time
Everyone wants to love someone
Everyone wants to have a...
Crazy little party girl
Crazy little party girl
Always ready to dance
I got a feeling that you'll be alright
It's a natural feeling
Everyone needs a little time
Everyone wants to love someone
Everyone wants to have a...
Crazy little party girl
Crazy little party girl
Always ready to dance
Crazy little party girl
Crazy little party girl
Always ready to dance
I can tell you've been hurt
Some guy brought safety to your happy world
You need love but you're afraid that if you give in
Someone else will come along
And break your heart again
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl
I could make you happy babe and satisfy you too
But why won't you give me a chance to prove my love to you
Won't you just give me just one little chance
I give you love that's guaranteed you won't be hurt again
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl
I'm not ashamed to tell the world that you really messed up my world
I'd rather hurt myself than to ever hurt you
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl
I heard that you were leaving.
You're my best friend.
I always think about you
All the time you're on my mind
We played together you and I
I can't believe that its true
Now I have to see you leave
You're the only one for me
I don't wanna see you go
I just wanna let you know that
I have a crush on you
I can't wait no longer girl
I'm gonna miss you forever
I'm gonna miss you girl
The first time that I saw you
I knew it from the very start
You had a place deep in my heart
I can't believe that it's true
Now it's time for you to leave
And Baby I just can't believe
Repeat bridge and chorus
It's only the matter of time
I just wanna let you know
That I can't wait no longer girl
Repeat Chorus to fade
Gonna miss... gonna miss
I'm gonna miss you forever...
I remember the day we met
Kinda like Romeo and Juliet
I'm never gonna forget
Now my knees went weak
And then you held my hand
And looked me in the eyes
That I don't understand
That I'll never learn myself
I want to do what you want me to do
I want you and no one else
Tell me how to make you smile
I want you to tell me how how
Tell me how to make you smile
Tell me how to make you smile
I heard about how wonderful love can be
I never could of dreamed
To share myself with you in a special way
And it's all about this new dance
Here we go... yeah...
That I want you to know
You gotta shake it to the left
Shake it to the right
Let Aaron take you through it
If you wanna get down
Just shake it to the left
Shake it to the right
Shake it to the right
Frankfurt likes to shake it
New York likes to shake it
Japan likes to shake it
It would ruin my whole world
And never ever go away
I guess I always will
You're my best friend
You're my love within
I just want you to know
That I will always love you
Please don't go stay with me
You're the only one that is right
Tell me girl that you'll stay
I don't ever want to see you go away
I guess I always will
I'm gonna love you girl
I'm gonna love you girl until the end of time
Tell me girl that you'll always be mine
Please don't go girl You would ruin my whole world
Stop... everybody get wild
The time has come to get wild
Rise up and follow fusion
Our youth is just an illusion
Let's start a revolution
We'll find our restitution
Stop... everybody get wild
To take control or you lose it
Your way to find an escape from dancing to this song
Stop... everybody get wild
To explore the mysteries of life
And the reality of our youth
Is overlooked by those who restrict our freedom
This is Aaron and this is my world
Stop... everybody get wild
A crowded room is in rage
Stop... everybody get wild
I'd do anything... for you.
We've had our good times and bad
Now that you're gone... away
It's hard for me to say
I just want you to know
That the love I have is real
But girl I really want to show you how I feel
Oh tell me why can't I
Just like the way it used to be
I miss you all of the time
I miss the way it seemed so right
How could I let the girl I love
Slip right through my hands
I can't get you off my mind
I just want you to know
That the love I have is real
But girl I really want to show you how I feel
Oh tell me why can't I
Just like the way it used to be
I just want to make you happy
I want to make you understand
I need you for my girlfriend
Oh I miss holding hands and playing games
It'll never be the same
Oh tell me why can't I
Just like the way it used to be
I'll tell you that I love you
Oh... Tell me why can't I
Just like the way it used to be
Oh tell me why can't I
Ooh ya... Ain't that cute
My mama told me I'm too young to love
But I know what I know and I can't get enough
Pushing you on a swing
Is that there's nothing I won't do to be with you
I often wonder the meaning of love
Nick always told me just to follow my dreams
But with love on my mind it is so hard to see
And still when I think of you all I know
Is that there's nothing I won't do to be with you
It's true if I'm wrong
Then tell me girl what I should do
Or would you even care
If I told you love could be so simple
It's 4 o'clock in the morning
Somehow I still can't sleep
I've been tossing and turning
But I'm slowly learning
The questions are running deep
Never had this feeling before
But every time I see your face
My heart beats at a faster pace
And I don't understand it
Don't know the right words to say
When we meet face to face
And I can't get you out of my mind
Baby I've a crush on you
I can see it in the way that you smile
Deep inside I hope that it's true
I've got a crush on you
Sometimes I see you around town
The way the wind blows in your hair
But you don't even know that I'm there
Just want to run up and hold you
And tell you what's going on in my head
And I choose silence instead
And I don't understand it
Don't know the right words to say
When we meet face to face
And I can't get you out of my mind
Baby I've a crush on you
I can see it in the way that you smile
Deep inside I hope that it's true
I've got a crush on you
I've got a crush on you
I've got a crush on you
I've got a crush on you
I've got a crush on you
I've got a crush on you
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say
When you swing it all the way
You stood out amongst the crowd
And I was left without a doubt
That you were meant for me
So romanced was I by you
One dance and then I knew
Oh baby won't you swing it out
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say
When you swing it all the way
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say
When you swing it all the way
I have never known before
The way I want you now
I admit you are the best
And with you I am obsessed
And could never do without
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say
When you swing it all the way
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say
When you swing it all the way
And tonight don't you make any other plans
Unless you're making them with me
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say
When you swing it all the way
My house. It's gonna be the party of the century. Every one's gonna be there.
Here's a little bit of old school for ya
That goes a little something like this
I always tried to be the fliest kid in the block
The popular one with the rising stock
So that's when I had this bright idea
Throw the party of the month
All the fine girls couldn't turn it down
Now all I gotta do is get my parents out
Should I send them to a movie
It's gotta be long though
I guess somewhere along I lost my head
People all around you gotta
Everyone together sing it loud
Jump all around come on
People all around you gotta
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
And the kid spilled juice
Another kid broke a lamp
They got them from France
But now I won't sweat it
I'll clean it up later
And I really wanna meet her
People all around you gotta
Everyone together sing it loud
Jump all around come on
People all around you gotta
Everybody get out now
I'm dead that's it for me
I'm gonna be picked off my family tree
And they're walking up the steps
I guess life was good with 10 seconds left
People all around you gotta
Everyone together sing it loud
Jump all around come on
People all around you gotta
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I wanna see this girl
I know a girl who's tough but sweet
She's got everything that I desire
Sets my summer sun on fire
Go to see her when the sun goes down
Ain't no finer girl in town
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
But I like candy when it's wrapped in a sweater
Some day soon I'll make you mine
Then I'll have candy all the time
Candy in the morning time
Candy in the hot sunshine
Candy baby can't you see
All I want is your candy
I wanna see ya bounce
This is one of a kind
Like a hot chili pepper
Don't know if you can take it
So now we're gonna shake
We've got a crazy notion
Throw your hands in the air
In and you feel the swing
You just won't stand around
When you feel the swing
With a bouncy bouncy gonna make you happy
Come and dance with me
With a bouncy bouncy gonna make you happy
Come and dance with me
Can't you see it's not enough
They say turn it down
Generation of millennium
Throw your hands in the air
When the beat kicks in
And you feel the swing
You just won't stand around
When you feel the swing
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Everybody jump up and down
I wanna see you have a good time
I wanna see you shout it out
I wanna see you bounce
Let's shake the floor
Here we go we're gonna bounce
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
With a bouncy bouncy gonna make you happy
Come and dance with me
Ain't no doubt about it
I can't wait to get home to you
Connected with my baby
Here in the room we are as one
She's my best kept secret
She's my one and only
She's my best kept secret
Gotta find my way back to you
You left me the password to your heart
She's my best kept secret
She's my one and only
She's my best kept secret
She's my one and only
She's my best kept secret
She's my one and only
She's my best kept secret
She's my one and only
She's my best kept secret
She's my one and only...
So I can see your voice
And it goes a little something like this
Come on get up get up
I wanna make it bounce
Guess what happened to me
I was hanging at the court
Just playing some ball
I heard the fans screaming
I thought it was for me
But then I saw a shadow
But when I beat you real bad try not to cry
You must've been nervous I knew I could take him
Start the game the whistle blows
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
I thought I had the lead
But then he started scoring mad points on me
I knew that there was a way that I could make it stop
I guess your getting nervous
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
Cheerleaders are cheering
Cheerleaders are cheering
I put the ball up I put him in shame
I must admit that it sounds real crazy
But the ball went in then he cried like a baby
You're good too and we can still be friends
The fans went nuts they put me on their shoulders
Then I heard a voice and it sounded like my mother's
I guess that kinda thing could never happen to me
If it was a dream and it wasn't real
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
The monkey chewed tobacco on streetcar line
And they all went to heaven on a little row boat
Pat it on your partners hand... right hand
Cross it with your left arm
Pat your partner left palm
Slap your thigh and sing a little song
That she would treat me
That's why she told her
The monkey chewed tobacco on streetcar line
And they all went to heaven on a little row boat
Clap your hands and prepare to pat
Pat your partner palm with your right palm
Take your hand back and clap
Cross your right arm with your left arm
Pat your partner left palm with your left palm
Take your hand with your palm and slap your thigh
And watch the fun materialize
That she would treat me
That's why she told her
The monkey chewed tobacco on the streetcar line
And they all went to heaven in a little row boat
That she would treat me
That's why she told her
That's why she told her
That she would treat me
That's why she told her
The monkey chewed tobacco on the streetcar line
My Grandma and your Grandma
My Grandma said to your Grandma
Look at my king all dressed in red
Betcha five dollars or he'll kill you dead
My flag boy and your flag boy
My flag boy said to your flag boy
See that guy all dressed in green
Be sure you know how to have a real good time
You and I are not to blame
Sometimes we just go insane
You and I have much to give
Everything is relative When we have our darker days
We just go our separate ways
You and I are not to blame
Sometimes we just go insane yeah yeah
Be sure you know how to have a real good time yeah yeah
Sometimes baby in your eyes
Love is truly justified
I just wanna terrorize
Making up is oh so good
Yeah we rock the neighborhood
You and I are not to blame
Sometimes we just go insane yeah yeah
Be sure you know how to have a real good time
Won't you tell me what you wanna do
Won't you tell me what you wanna do
Don't keep me guessing
You got me drowning in a sea of despair
I've held up for as long as I can
Tell me what you want
Tell me what your gonna do girl
Tell me what you want
Tell me what I have to do girl
Maybe we need some time apart
We need to find out what's gone wrong
Before the love's completely gone
I've held up for as long as I can
I need to know am I still your man
Is there a reason to be concerned
Tell me what you want
Tell me what your gonna do girl
Tell me what you want
Tell me what I have to do girl oh yeah
To say what's left of my pride
Is the grass greener on the other side
Tell me what you want
Tell me what your gonna do girl
Tell me what you want
Tell me what I have to do girl oh yeah
Tell me what you want
Tell me what your gonna do girl
Tell me what you want
Tell me what I have to do girl oh yeah
Won't you tell me what
Won't you tell me what you wanna do
Won't you tell me what
And I can't seem to think
When you're smiling at me
The moment that I laid my eyes on you
I knew you'd be the one
To make my dreams come true
Something I won't find
Baby you're always on my mind
If I could find a way
The moment that I laid my eyes my eyes on you
I knew you'd be the one
To make my dreams come true
Girl I can't imagine being without you
And I know you're going to make my dreams come true
You know I'll never leave you
I'll never deceive you
I'll give you every piece of my heart
You're all I need to survive
And girl you keep me alive
I got planned a major scam
With something to dance to
Don't listen to the talk
Take a walk on the wild side
Cause you know and I know
That we rule the dance floor
I guess that it's a no no
From the left to the right
Ain't gonna mix with the latest craze
But they don't know about
Cause you know and I know
That we rule the dance floor
I guess that it's a no no
From the left to the right
Cruise with hesitation
You know it gives me the chills
Walking down the street
Let it hang down on me
The other day I was hanging with some friends
Going around the room talking about our favorite noise
I said I had a brother in the Backstreet Boys
Hey is this some kinda trick
I have to see their show
Your wish is my command
In fact I'll get some tickets here for everyone
Let me call Nick and tell him
Can you hook up some seats
There's nothing that can beat the connection I got
You make empty promises oh so big
I promised people tickets
So you gotta come through
I can get you maybe a dozen
You can't promise seats to everyone and their cousin
You make empty promises oh so big
I thought we were blood.
I thought we were family.
You make big promises oh so big
I'm not too young and I'm not too old
This ain't Aaron's party
Par to a 2 come and show me body
Come and talk to me in the backseat
We could surf the board
We could make a little bet
See when it comes to girls
Baby take back up on the seat
But when I get in trouble
I put my cap way down
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
It's A to the A to the R O N
That's my life bro. It's in my blood
Bring on the skateboards
Where's the concentration
I'll make it happen if it seems that you won
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
He's been out with the older boys
He's been out with the younger girls
He's been out with the older boys
He's been out with the younger girls
Hello. I'm not too young
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
And I'm here to make it hot
I step into a room you could hear a pin drop
I could fly ya to the moon
Don't try to take me out
I said come and get it
I partied down the block
I get my crew together
And I make a pit stop
You know we're gonna hold it down
11 o'clock on the dot
All the girls on the floor
You know we're gonna hold it down
You know we're gonna hold it down
Sing the song you know it don't stop
Yo my man get behind the wheel it's time to cruise
You snooze you lose let me introduce you
To my friends in the other car right behind us
And my other friends in the car right behind them
Crank it up and let it pump
And when its time to hit the road
And when the beat rocks
And when the show starts
Repeat after me sing it loud
Every body come and follow me
Every body come and follow me
The caravan rolls out to the movies
Then its time go to the Backstreet Boys show
Or the Britney Spears show
I want best reception for each and everybody
So when I hit the stage show me love don't be rude
And afterwards hear my brother burn rubber dude
And when the beat rocks
And when the show starts
Repeat after me sing it loud
Everyone come and follow me
Sing the song you know it don't stop
And every single bus baby to and from school
And when the show starts
Repeat after me sing it loud
Every body come and follow me
See you walking down the street
Girl you never seem to have a smile on your face
What you need is someone who would treat you right
Ain't no doubt about what I would do
I think you'd approve
I'm thinking how to put it
To make you understand how far I'd go
That I'd do anything in this world for you
I'll push it to the limit
Ain't nothing I won't do
Make every single wish come true
I'll take it to the edge of the universe
You know that I would
Jumps a cannon like an eagle I'll be your super hero
Protect you from evil
She'll never have another
They were made for each other
Babe Ruth and his bat
Tiger Woods and Nike hat
That we go together like that
One thing I'd like to mention
I'd give ya every second
I'll do anything in this world for you
I'll push it to the limit
Ain't nothing I won't do
Make every single wish come true
I'll take it to the edge of the universe
You know that I would
This kind of magical kingdom
Is ya always gotta party
And let's get started
I'll do anything in this world for you
I'll push it to the limit
Ain't nothing I won't do
Make every single wish come true
I'll take it to the edge of the universe
You know that I would
No lifts or tucks or plastic
The way she works her magic
She's got me like an addict
Fantasize it used to mean that
Check out the girl on the corner of Mason
Check out the way she ties up her laces
But I know what I want
No time to blind or phase me
Your body activates me
And I kinda like that
Check out the girl on the corner of Mason
Check out the way she ties up her laces
But I know what I want
Baby it's you that I want
So come a little closer
And don't get me wrong
You're always with me even though you're far away
Just the sound of your voice makes my heart melt
No baby you never have to question my love
And every night there's a new crowd
I know you worry sometimes
Some other girl will make me forget you're mine
There's not a doubt in this world
That anyone could take the place of my number one girl it's true
No baby you never have to question my love
And every night there's a new crowd
Oh girl. I'm all about you
When I close my eyes I can see you
It's like you're right here
You're with me everywhere
No baby you never have to question my love
And every night there's a new crowd
Turn it up Pump it up
All the kids gonna bounce to this
All the kids gonna jump to this
All the kids gonna snap to this
How many people understand me that this is why
Then you get a car to make it to the job and back
Can you tell me why things gotta be this way
Become president and play on the dream team
Bring home the gold medal for the ladies
Grab a pen and some paper from my knapsack
And do a little homework for my math class
I always kick it just the way I want to
When I roll with the changes
To yourself make a promise
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss
I be the one that be dropping the hints
Even though I got a lot of dough
And I bought the big screen with the Zomba Deal
I still rock my Timberlands every time I can
Never miss an episode of the Batman
And I still show love to my parents
Doing chores when I'm home running errands
I always kick it just the way I want to
When I roll with the changes
To yourself make a promise
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss
Never wanna change when the get a certain age
I always kick it just the way I want to
When I roll with the changes
To yourself make a promise
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss
I always kick it just the way I want to
When I roll with the changes
To yourself make a promise
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss
Here we go with the J I V E
Here we go with the J I V E
Really wanted me baby
I see it in your eyes
I gotta have your number
I gotta make your day
I met myself a cowgirl
I met myself a cowgirl
Sunday afternoon with the fellas
Said I have a show in Texas
A new hang out friend
Signing autographs as
I run to catch the plane
Cheeks with long braids
She played hard to get
As I offered out my name
Just when ya thought it was safe
Got a hundred million people
On your brand new shirt
When you feel your gums flap
You ain't getting old
It's only Aaron Carter here
All the things in my room I
All the guys and the girls I
All the things in my room I
All the people out in Cali say
Not another earthquake
Rock the whole nation
Photos flying off the walls
Trouble with the bass vibration
We're coming through like that
I'm hitting every angle
That's what I'm all about
I can't stop even if you scream and shout
All the things in my room I
All the guys and the girls I
All the things in my room I
All the people out in Cali say
Not another earthquake
Warn your friends its Aaron Carter again
Gotta move baby because it hurts so good
Gonna shake the confetti for newly weds
I can shake the whole station
All the things in my room I
All the guys and the girls I
All the things in my room I
All the people out in Cali say
Not another earthquake
All the things in my room I
All the guys and the girls I
All the things in my room I
All the people out in Cali say
Not another earthquake
I remember sunny days
Shell toed shoes the girls would wear
Pink bikinis everywhere
There's so much that we've been through
There's still so much more to do
Growing up can be so strange
But some things will never change
To all the girls that had my back
I'm with you and it's like that
To all the girls that sang along with me
To all the girls you're where I wanna be
To all the girls from here across the sea
I wanna thank you for being good to me
To all the girls that I can't wait to see
To all the girls who've held it down for me
To all the girls who gave me memories
I wanna thank you for being good to me
I wanna thank you for being good to me
Sometimes I sit and reminisce
Of all the hot girls that I miss
All the guys know what I mean
All the girls that's on my block
You've been down with me since one
And we've only just begun
Growing up can be so strange
But some things will never change
To all the girls that had my back
I'm with you and it's like that
To all the girls that sang along with me
To all the girls you're where I wanna be
To all the girls from here across the sea
I wanna thank you for being good to me
To all the girls that I can't wait to see
To all the girls who've held it down for me
To all the girls who gave me memories
I wanna thank you for being good to me
I wanna thank you for being good to me
So let me hit you with one more
Baby I'll see you out on tour
And we can do it all again
To all the girls that sang along with me
To all the girls where I wanna be
To all the girls from here across the sea
I wanna thank you for being good to me
To all the girls that I can't wait to see
To all the girls who held it down for me
To all the girls who gave me memories
So grab your stuff and let's all go outside
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Everybody starts to feel the vibe
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice
I've been working real hard for just one reason
I've been waiting all year for just one season
The season that reminds me of
24 hours just to clean the Benz
So you can cruise down the boulevard with your friends
Right here is where you belong
So if your down with me then get up and come along
So grab your stuff and let's all go outside
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Everybody starts to feel the vibe
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice
Had to take a sip on Ma's homemade
Freshly squeezed lemonade
There is only one thing that's on everybody's mind
Right here is where you belong
So if your down with me then get up and come along
So grab your stuff and let's all go outside
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Everybody starts to feel the vibe
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice
Right now we're going to bring it
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Grab your stuff and let's go back inside
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Say goodnight to all of your friends
So grab your stuff and let's all go outside
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Everybody starts to feel the vibe
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice
So grab your stuff and let's all go outside
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Everybody starts to feel the vibe
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice
I don't really care what everybody says
Anyway all I wanna do is drive okay
AC on the plates my initials
The little weasel's now got diesel
Now I'm grown up but I ain't all sewn up
I'm coming through with the system blasting
Watch me ride till the tank is empty
Anywhere I wanna go don't tempt me
Catch me or you're gonna be left lonely
In the dust of the one and only
Can't hold me control me
Feels like Formula One but Oh No
Let me see your drivers license and registration
I don't need one it's Aaron's Alien Nation
If you let me off I'll write your daughter out an autograph
Give me a ticket he said boy look uh
Get out of here before I lose my cool
Watch me ride till the tank is empty
Anywhere I wanna go don't tempt me
In the dust of the one and only
Can't hold me control me
Watch me ride till the tank is empty
Anywhere I wanna go don't tempt me
In the dust of the one and only
Can't hold me control me
Watch me ride till the tank is empty
Anywhere I wanna go don't tempt me
Catch me or you're gonna be left lonely
In the dust of the one and only
Can't hold me control me
Remember we'd be up all night
Like the way it used to be
I see you baby I know
I may not say those words anymore
But maybe it just ain't my way
You ask me do I love you but
Why I walked on water for you
My first steps on the moon
Have you ever wondered why
I gave three wishes to you
The answer lies in you
Remember we used to laugh and say
No one understood our way
Get that off your mind
I may not say those words anymore
You ask me do I love you but
Why I walked on water for you
My first steps on the moon
Have you ever wondered why
I gave three wishes to you
You asked the question
The answer lies in you
Lies within your heart
Please take a look inside
You ask me do I love you but
Why I walked on water for you
My first steps on the moon
Have you ever wondered why
I gave three wishes to you
You asked the question
You ask me do I love you but
Why I walked on water for you
My first steps on the moon
Have you ever wondered why
I gave three wishes to you
You asked the question
The answer lies in you
The answer lies in you

You skip your breakfast
But there is so much more to you
So put me to the test
I don't have to guess
I know everything and anything
What you like to wear
What your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
Now your middle name is August
You were born in November
But your from Ontario
The twin sisters like
We've got so much in common
But there's more we could do
So put me to the test
I don't even have to sweat
I know everything and anything

Understanding all that which is female
When they should be listening

Bang your heads to this

Does this sound a little serious to you
But I never bring it all in your face
It's time to get down
Ain't no time to clown around
Right about now time fix the frown
Face to face and body to body
We're gonna pull through
Lemme clear your mind
From New York to Cali
Everywhere in between
Ain't nobody gonna stop our dreams
And no matter what they say
And I got it like that
So don't take it like that
The grass ain't greener
From the valleys to the hills to the snow
Everybody come together
Lemme clear your mind
From New York to Cali
Ain't nobody gonna stop our dreams
And no matter what they say
And no matter what they say
And no matter what they say
And no matter what they say
I've been around on this journey
You gotta face the fight just to live the dream
Who could have believed
That what I've achieved
Who would have ever guessed it
Who's been there for me
Even shed a tear for me
You're the one who's kept it real
So in return this is how I feel
And I had to tell you in this song
The ups and downs were there
Many people don't know the life I live
You're still my number one
You're the one who's kept it real
So in return this is how I feel
And I had to tell you in this song
One shout to my family
Two shouts to my boys at home
Although I'm not there
You know you're not alone
Three shouts to my label
The ones I think about
And I had to tell you in this song
And I had to tell you in this song
Where would I be today
When I look into your sad eyes
It makes me feel for you
That was always shining through
Someone broke your heart
Now it's easy to give up
It's not the end of love
Cause anything happens for a reason
Though tonight tears fill your eyes
I'll be right here to lean on
You're gonna make it through
Has anybody ever told you
Just one smile from you
Can open up any heart
Let somebody lift you up
You're gonna find love... yeah
Cause anything happens for a reason
Though tonight tears fill your eyes
I'll be right here to lean on
You're gonna make it through
Keep believing just have faith
I promise you the clouds will break
And find that someone...
Cause anything happens for a reason
Though tonight tears fill your eyes
I'll be right here to lean on
You're gonna make it through
Here's a little bit of old school for ya
That goes a little something like this
I always tried to be the fliest kid in the block
The popular one with the rising stock
So that's when I had this bright idea
Throw the party of the month
All the fine girls couldn't turn it down
Now all I gotta do is get my parents out
Should I send them to a movie
It's gotta be long though
I guess somewhere along I lost my head
People all around you gotta
Everyone together sing it loud
Jump all around come on
People all around you gotta
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
And the kid spilled juice
Another kid broke a lamp
They got them from France
But now I won't sweat it
I'll clean it up later
And I really wanna meet her
People all around you gotta
Everyone together sing it loud
Jump all around come on
People all around you gotta
Everybody get out now
I'm dead that's it for me
I'm gonna be picked off my family tree
And they're walking up the steps
I guess life was good with 10 seconds left
People all around you gotta
Everyone together sing it loud
Jump all around come on
People all around you gotta
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I wanna see this girl
I know a girl who's tough but sweet
She's got everything that I desire
Sets my summer sun on fire
Go to see her when the sun goes down
Ain't no finer girl in town
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
But I like candy when it's wrapped in a sweater
Some day soon I'll make you mine
Then I'll have candy all the time
Candy in the morning time
Candy in the hot sunshine
Candy baby can't you see
All I want is your candy
And it goes a little something like this
Come on get up get up
I wanna make it bounce
Guess what happened to me
I was hanging at the court
Just playing some ball
I heard the fans screaming
I thought it was for me
But then I saw a shadow
But when I beat you real bad try not to cry
You must've been nervous I knew I could take him
Start the game the whistle blows
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
I thought I had the lead
But then he started scoring mad points on me
I knew that there was a way that I could make it stop
I guess your getting nervous
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
Cheerleaders are cheering
Cheerleaders are cheering
I put the ball up I put him in shame
I must admit that it sounds real crazy
But the ball went in then he cried like a baby
You're good too and we can still be friends
The fans went nuts they put me on their shoulders
Then I heard a voice and it sounded like my mother's
I guess that kinda thing could never happen to me
If it was a dream and it wasn't real
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
The other day I was hanging with some friends
Going around the room talking about our favorite noise
I said I had a brother in the Backstreet Boys
Hey is this some kinda trick
I have to see their show
Your wish is my command
In fact I'll get some tickets here for everyone
Let me call Nick and tell him
Can you hook up some seats
There's nothing that can beat the connection I got
You make empty promises oh so big
I promised people tickets
So you gotta come through
I can get you maybe a dozen
You can't promise seats to everyone and their cousin
You make empty promises oh so big
I thought we were blood.
I thought we were family.
You make big promises oh so big
This ain't Aaron's party
Come and show me body
Come and talk to me in the backseat
We could surf the board
We could make a little bet
See when it comes to girls
Baby face back up on the seat
But when I get in trouble
I pull my cap way down
And say I'm eleven years old
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
It A to the A to the R O N
Trying to say I look ten
I'm not telling you again
Catch me in the studio
That my life bro Its in my blood
Bring on the skateboards
I'll wipe the floor with you
Where the concentration
I make it happen if it seems that you won
Aaron Carter got you open
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
Batting in the majors
I'm anywhere between 12 and 18 years old
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
You're always with me even though you're far away
Just the sound of your voice makes my heart melt
No baby you never have to question my love
And every night there's a new crowd
I know you worry sometimes
Some other girl will make me forget you're mine
There's not a doubt in this world
That anyone could take the place of my number one girl it's true
No baby you never have to question my love
And every night there's a new crowd
Oh girl. I'm all about you
When I close my eyes I can see you
It's like you're right here
You're with me everywhere
No baby you never have to question my love
And every night there's a new crowd
And ya know we're gonna groove
Even when they mess up
Think the kids rule the world
We might start a play fight
Don't start to cry now
What would ya do if I
Here come the young ones
The baby crime busters
Relax now we're equal
And if the money's right
We might make a sequel
I love it when you beg me
And I might put you in
What would ya do if I
Is that what I deserve
Tell me who's gonna bake
Who's gonna suffer from
And answer when I'm mowing
And who's gonna get me up
And who's gonna tell me
Hot chick like Lara Croft
You've been told old for too long
If you're old enough to vote
Then it's time to sit down
So if you're too young to vote
Here's your chance to have a say
What would ya do if I
What would ya do if I
Just when ya thought it was safe
Got a hundred million people
On your brand new shirt
When you feel your gums flap
You ain't getting old
It's only Aaron Carter here
All the things in my room I
All the guys and the girls I
All the things in my room I
All the people out in Cali say
Not another earthquake
Rock the whole nation
Photos flying off the walls
Trouble with the bass vibration
We're coming through like that
I'm hitting every angle
That's what I'm all about
I can't stop even if you scream and shout
All the things in my room I
All the guys and the girls I
All the things in my room I
All the people out in Cali say
Not another earthquake

So grab your stuff and let's all go outside

Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice

Remember we'd be up all night
Like the way it used to be
I see you baby I know

Saw you when you were trying to kick it to her
Got a little kiss and you were
Don't tell me you think you got her
It's all become a little hotter
Don't get hung up about it
I don't want to be the one to tell you
You knew you were never meant to be
You're too blind to see
She's got you kind of mixed up and twisted
You had a good shot and missed it
She told me I'm the one she runs to
Whenever she wants a fun dude
You better get your facts straight
I'm telling you the truth
You're too hung up about it
And you don't really know what she needs
You knew you were never meant to be
You're too blind to see
You gotta let it be she wants me...
I don't want to be the one to tell you
You knew you were never meant to be
You're too blind to see
I'm the one she told me so
I don't want to be the one to tell you
You knew you were never meant to be
You're too blind to see
Give me a half a chance
I'll make you understand
That what I've got to give
Is so much more than this
Than you'll ever know
I don't say what's on my mind
But you'll find this out in time
I'm not quick to trust
And let someone inside
I've got a lot to learn
Never felt this way before
But I've got to say what's right for me
You should know that I can
Be more than you will ever need
I'll show you something new to see
I'll be the one you can believe
You've seen some falling stars
You've felt a broken heart
Learn from my mistakes
Know exactly what you are
But I can't hang on the side
Had enough of all these fights
Got to get this through
I've got a lot to learn
Never felt this way before
But I got to say what's right for me
You should know that I can
Be more than you will ever need
I'll show you something new to see
I'll be the one you can believe
You don't have to be alone
You should know that I can
Be more than you will ever need
I'll show you something new to see
I'll be the one you can believe
Wouldn't be back when I'm
Leaving all the red hots
Gotta do this show so I can get my dough
Bumped in there low with you and I
Where we can drop and get ill
A better spot we can chill
We'll hide out whenever things get real
Until we get this gig
We keep it real like that
Onto a two month 8 weeks 60 days later
I laid so many groupies off
One I even made her cry
I had to tell her I really didn't hit her right
I never thought that I
Would never see that day that I
Fall for her the way that I did
I hold it down and keep it tight
I could never say goodbye
We keep it real like that
Give me a half a chance
I'll make you understand
That what I've got to give
Is so much more than this
Than you'll ever know
I don't say what's on my mind
But you'll find this out in time
I'm not quick to trust
And let someone inside
I've got a lot to learn
Never felt this way before
But I've got to say what's right for me

Be more than you will ever need
I'll show you something new to see
I'll be the one you can believe
You've seen some falling stars
You've felt a broken heart
Learn from my mistakes
Know exactly what you are
But I can't hang on the side
Had enough of all these fights
Got to get this through
I've got a lot to learn
Never felt this way before
But I got to say what's right for me
You should know that I can
Be more than you will ever need
I'll show you something new to see
I'll be the one you can believe
You don't have to be alone
You should know that I can
Be more than you will ever need
I'll show you something new to see
I'll be the one you can believe
No more coffee in the morning
I'm wide awake while he sleeping in
Know that's why you're calling
Coping with the fact that you're alone
You traded my heart for some fool's gold
Can't think about your nights with him
Wearing nothing but the moonlight
When you feel your conscience stepping in
All the shit that you pretend you want
You traded my heart for some fool's gold
You traded my heart for some fool's gold
You traded my heart for some fool's gold
These past days and past nights
Walks under streetlights
Something don't feel right
Sooner or later she'll be
Sooner or later she'll
Sooner or later she'll
Sooner or later she'll be
Sooner or later she'll be
Sooner or later she'll be
I ain't calling you back
When you feeling like that
Cause sooner or later she'll be
When you feeling like that
Don't tell me I'm not sure
Don't tell me I'm not yours
And sooner or later we'll be
I need your body on me like lotion
Sooner or later she'll
Call me and tell me she's feeling alone tonight
Sooner or later she'll
Text me and tell me that she's leaving on the light
Sooner or later she'll be
Sooner or later she'll be
Sooner or later she'll be
I ain't calling you back
When you feeling like that
Cause sooner or later she'll be
When you feeling like that
Ooh we'll be together
Every little step I take
Every little step I take
Every little step I take
Every little step I take
I can't sleep at night...
Listen for the telephone
Can't believe you called my home
And as a matter of fact
You would even talk to me
Because a boy like you
Is like a dream come true
No matter what your friends try to tell ya
We were meant to fall in love
And we will be together
Every little step I take
Every little step I make
Every little step I take
Every little step I make
I can't sleep at night
Listen for the telephone
Can't believe you called my home
And as a matter of fact
You would even talk to me
Because a boy like you
Is like a dream come true
No matter what your friends try to tell ya
We were meant to fall in love
And we will be together
Every little step I take
Every little step I make
Every little step I take
Every little step I make
Every little step I take
Every little step I take
Every little step I take
Every little step I take
No matter what your friends try and tell ya
We were meant to fall in love
And we will be together
Every little step I take
Every little step I make
Every little step I take
Every little step I make
I wanna show the world how this could be amazing
Drinking lemonade with the sun looking down me
It's summertime and it's like the sea
The radio blearing at the best summer sound
And the summer vibrations got a hold on me
One for the summertime
Everyone's got that summer vibe and
One for the summertime
Gonna party on all through the night
Just like everybody should
You gotta pump up your radio
We're the world's eighth wonder and we're doing it all
And it just won't stop
One for the summertime
Everyone's got that summer vibe and
One for the summertime
Gonna party on all through the night
Just like everybody should
You gotta pump up your radio
You gotta pump up your radio
Gimme one for the summer
You gotta pump up your radio
Gimme one for the summer
Gimme one for the summer
Gimme one for the summer
You gotta pump up your radio
Gimme one for the summer
Gimme one for the summer
Gimme one for the summer
Something felt funny to me
Jumped up out of the bed
But he said his name was Steve
And he didn't look like what I thought he would be
It was all combed out with the system up
And I thought we were going to Mars
We got there and I read a sign
Roll up to the rock where
There's a universe of rhythm
Everyone is a cosmic freak
And we only have one mission
Here's what you got to do
Don't try to take two
Make sure that you bump your fists like this
Know we gonna innovate
It really doesn't matter
If you're short or tall
And I'm proving it all
Around these parts we don't take no show
With the unity soon to be in the streets
You can see with your own eyes
It's just another day in the AC Nation
Roll up to the rock where
There's a universe of rhythm
Everyone is a cosmic freak
And we only have one mission
You say you wanna dance
Up and down and side to side
Roll up to the rock where
There's a universe of rhythm
Roll up to the rock where
There's a universe of rhythm
Roll up to the rock where
There's a universe of rhythm
Everyone is a cosmic freak
And we only have one mission
I'm not your everyday average celebrity
I don't complain about the life I live
I believe what you give is what you get
I flash a smile at the paparazzi
So you know I'm embracing it
Everybody wants a piece of me
To get a glimpse of the life I lead
You might see me as a superstar
But I don't even drive a fancy car
There's enough of me to go around
I never hesitate if you want an autograph
I'll go and sign my name across your heart
So quote me wrong all day the only thing I'll do is laugh
You write the script you know I'll play the part
I flash a smile at the paparazzi
So you know I'm embracing it
Everybody wants a piece of me
To get a glimpse of the life I lead
You might see me as a superstar
But I don't even drive a fancy car
There's enough of me to go around
I got more than enough to give
What's the use in holding back
I've only got one life to live
I'm gonna make the best of all I have
Everybody wants a piece of me
To get a glimpse of the life I lead
You might see me as a superstar
But I don't even drive a fancy car
Get up on ya feet now
Get up on ya feet now
Get up on ya feet now
Hear the noise and feel the heat
Don't have to run when ya get the call
Beat the buzz is the thrill of it all
Make some noise all you girls and boys
Come on. We're all fired up and ready to roll
Get up on ya feet now
Get up on ya feet now
Get up on ya feet now
Jump aboard and then don't look back
The whole world that you're no joke
Don't have to run when ya get the call
Beat the buzz is through it all
So make some noise all you girls and boys
Come on. We're all fired up and ready to roll
Get up on ya feet now

Just in case a black hole wanna act up.
Where I'm going ain't no man ever been.
It's Jimmy Neutron time.
Forget about physics.
It's Jimmy Neutron time.
It's Jimmy Neutron time.
When there's something better to do
It started in the house
It moved on to the streets
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party's gonna bump
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party is too short
We all need a permanent vacation
From the things that get us down
So just turn it up and turn it out
Let's take it from the street
And move it to the beach
The sand beneath our feet
There's no place I'd rather be
And it's no secret why
It would never mean as much to me
Without you you by my side
Way behind the water hole
A little down the line
The jungle and the plains and peaks
Are scheduled to be mine
I'm gonna be the ruler
Of most everything around
From the grandest of the mountains
To the humble common ground
I'm going to be a noble king
I only need a little time
Perhaps a little hair
I'm gonna be the main event
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my roar
The fauna and the flora gonna swing
Nobody saying do this
Nobody saying be there
Nobody saying stop that
Nobody saying see here
Free to run around all day
I'll be free to do it my way
Nobody saying do this
Nobody saying be there
Nobody saying stop that
Nobody saying see here
I'll be free to do it my way
To talk of many things
But I would rather stick to talking kings
It's easy to be royal
If you're already leonine
It isn't just my right
Even my left will be divine
Oh... Oh... Oh I just can't wait to be king
Put your hands from side to side
So people live for the weekend
Seems like such a waste
Counting down till the fun begins
Get it started tonight
There's a party tonight
Imagine everyone in the world
Out in the streets at night
Everybody's gonna rock all day
Just 9 to 5 party time
Tell you like a party
Come on and talk to me
Let me grab you lovely one
Come sit down on my knee
I could tell you a story
Happened long time ago
I've been watching you grow
Come on and talk to me
Girl you know I love you more
Come sit down on my knee
Happened long time ago
I've been watching you grow
I could tell you a story
Happened long time ago
Little bitty pretty one
I've been watching you grow
Feeling the pain as innocence dies
Looking at life through my own eyes
I'm hoping and praying for a brighter day
I listen to my heart and I obey
That's just the way it goes
The world was made to change
Each day is a surprise
Feeling the pain as innocence dies
Looking at life through my own eyes
I'm hoping and praying for a brighter day
I listen to my heart and I obey
If you go and read between the lines
You'll discover how and why
Give that freedom bell a rattle
Get my independence signed
Declare it on the dotted line
And patriotic voices sing
Red White and Blue never give up
Feeling the pain as innocence dies
Looking at life through my own eyes
I'm hoping and praying for a brighter day
I listen to my heart and I obey
Everybody do what you wanna do.
Everyone its time to do your thing.
It's time to get down to the AC vibe.
Went the distance now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
You must fight just to keep them alive
And the last known survivor
And he's watching us all
They stack the odds still we take to the street
And the last known survivor
And he's watching us all
With the Eye of the Tiger
Just a man and his will to survive
And the last known survivor
And he's watching us all
Wondering why I do the things I do.
When all I can do is wait...
Your love's still there.
The ghost of you haunts my mind everywhere.
And someday soon I'll get you back in my life.
But I won't change my mind
How can I stop what I'm dreaming of
I'll wait forever for your love
Forever for your love.
Your touch felt right.
You'll be in my heart
Nothing is always the same.
Your love's still there.
The ghost of you haunts my mind everywhere.
And someday soon I'll get you back every night.
But I won't change my mind
How can I stop what I'm dreaming of
I'll wait forever for your love
And you got me wanting you.
And you got me wanting you.
I just can't believe the loveliness
I just can't believe the wonder
And you got me wanting you.
And you got me wanting you.
I knew how sweet a kiss could be.
Pour your sweetness over me.
And you got me wanting you.
Don't need no bullshit
Don't need no contract
I ain't gonna take it
So I ain't gonna take it no more
Can't stand the thunder
I ain't gonna take it
So I ain't gonna take it no more
Your days are numbered
It's your turn to cry
Sunshine and blue skies
I ain't gonna take it
Yeah It's so incredible
I used to love a girl
Sometimes I still think I do
She used to be the world
How can we be split in two
I'm official losing my mind
Chasing behind her heart
This just can't be real
I tired to play the field
I lost my share in one of few
I never really hit without the part
Live without you left me with a scar
I'm official losing my mind
Chasing behind her heart
This just can't be real
You know it's just a little thing to do
I like the way you turn around take your time
And I can tonight wanna make you mine
I know you want me baby
So let me say you're mine
Girl I'm looking at you and your looking at me
We out here on the floor tell me what's it gonna be
We in the spotlight shinning so bright
I look at ya standing here alone
If you wanna leave I got a place to go
I like the way you turn around take your time
And I can tonight wanna make you mine
I know you want me baby
So let me say you're mine
Girl I'm looking at you and your looking at me
We out here on the floor tell me what's it gonna be
We in the spotlight shinning so bright
See a girl like you is so hard to find
I can't wait till I make you mine
So girl let's stop wasting time
Girl I'm looking at you and your looking at me
We out here on the floor tell me what's it gonna be
We in the spotlight shinning so bright
I'm not too young and
This ain't Aaron's party
We could surf the board
We could make a little bet
See when it comes to girls
Baby take back up on the seat
But when I get in trouble
I put my cap way down
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
It's A to the A to the R O N
I'm all up in the video
Catch me in the studio
I tell my blood in my blood
Bring on the skateboards
I'll wipe the floor with you
Where's the concentration
Don't even talk about
If it seems that you won
Aaron Carter gotcha open
Don't font don't front
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
He's been out with the older boys
He's been out with the younger girls
He's been out with the older boys
He's been out with the younger girls
All I need is pillows
Hello I'm not too young
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
Gonna make a connection
And I'll show you how to rip up a kicker
The look in your eyes
Gonna take you on a ride
Gonna get it along fine
Let's get on the with the show
It's too good to be true
Now I'm riding with you
Too bad to believe it
If you know what I mean
Got me spinning around
With my feet off the ground
And I don't wanna come back down
It's too good to be true
I'm short of a girlfriend
Gonna take you on a ride
Gonna get it along fine
Let's get on the with the show
It's too good to be true
Now I'm riding with you
Too bad to believe it
If you know what I mean
Got me spinning around
With my feet off the ground
And I don't wanna come back down
It's too good to be true
Gonna take you on a ride
Gonna get it along fine
Let's get on the with the show
It's too good to be true
Now I'm riding with you
Too bad to believe it

Got me spinning around
With my feet off the ground
And I don't wanna come back down

And I don't wanna come back down
It's too good to be true
And I don't wanna come back down
Unemployment at a record high
People in the world try to make ends meet
I said you got to work hard to want to compete
Money is the key to end all your woes
Bills fly higher every day
We receive much lower pay
War's going on across the sea
Street soldiers killing the elderly
Disillusion is the word
That's used by me when I'm not heard
I just go through life with my glasses blurred
You can see a lot in this lifespan
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
You notice one time he was your man
But you laid in bed where the bums have laid
Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid
If you really think about it times aren't that bad
The one that stretches for success will make you glad
When you feel you fail sometimes it hurts
For a meaning in life is why you search
Here's another point in life you should not miss
Do not be a fool who's prejudice
Because we're all written down on the same list
Turn it up Pump it up
All the kids gonna bounce to this
All the kids gonna jump to this
All the kids gonna snap to this
How many people understand me that this is why
Then you get a car to make it to the job and back
Can you tell me why things gotta be this way
Become president and play on the dream team
Bring home the gold medal for the ladies
Grab a pen and some paper from my knapsack
And do a little homework for my math class
I always kick it just the way I want to
When I roll with the changes
To yourself make a promise
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss
I be the one that be dropping the hits
Even though I got a lot of dough
And I bought the big screen with the Zomba Deal
I still rock my Timberlands every time I can
Never miss an episode of the Batman
And I still show love to my parents
Do chores when I'm home from running errands
I always kick it just the way I want to
When I roll with the changes
To yourself make a promise
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss
Never wanna change when the get a certain age
I always kick it just the way I want to
When I roll with the changes
To yourself make a promise
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss
I always kick it just the way I want to
When I roll with the changes
To yourself make a promise
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss
And if you do you'll never lose
Baby since I saw you last
Good fortune's finally come my way
The lean days are a thing of the past
But it hasn't changed the way I feel
I can't imagine life without you
I got all the things that money can buy
Got enough to enjoy the good life
But I want to say I'd give it away
For the one thing I need
I've lived and learned a lesson in life
That money never buys you love
I cherish every moment in time
I got all the things that money can buy
Got enough to enjoy the good life
But I want to say I'd give it away
For the one thing I need
I never stopped thinking of you
Kept a photograph next to my bed
You paint a picture when you smile
I got all the things that money can buy
Got enough to enjoy the good life
But I want to say I'd give it away
For the one thing I need
I got all the things that money can buy
Got enough to enjoy the good life
But I want to say I'd give it away
For the one thing I need
Girl you knock me out
You make me wanna shout
When I'm with you everyday
I could love you right
Girl you knock me out
You make me wanna shout
To have you all alone
Girl you knock me out
You make me wanna shout
Girl you knock me out
You make me wanna shout
I'm gonna take it the top and I'm gonna laugh
I know what I've got so stop
To the east to the west
To the north and the south
They know AC and they know I get down
To the east to the west
To the north and the south
Keep my feet on the ground and they know that
But then you wanna come and take a knock at my wagon
But then you wanna come and take a knock at my wagon
I'm not the type of guy to show off for attention
About the fancy cars and jewels
Girls can't get enough of me
But that won't get in my way
To the east to the west
To the north and the south
They know AC and they know I get down
To the east to the west
To the north and the south
Keep my feet on the ground and they know that
But then you wanna come and take a knock at my wagon
But then you wanna come and take a knock at my wagon
This bright young kid works hard just to make these hits
Just to make me react
But Spectra's got my back
To the east to the west
To the north and the south
They know AC and they know I get down
To the east to the west
To the north and the south
Keep my feet on the ground and they know that
But then you wanna come and take a knock at my wagon
But then you wanna come and take a knock at my wagon
Yea Baby I'm ready for Christmas
Run Run Rudolph when you start to fall behind
And then away went Rudolph racing like a shooting star
Santa make him hurry tell him he can take the free reign down
And then away went Rudolph whizzing like a paper jet
Santa make him hurry tell him he can take the free reign down
Santa make him hurry tell him he can take the free reign down
Everywhere I go somebody I know
Wants to come and kick it with me
Saturday night and we're gonna have a party
Everywhere I go somebody I know

We're gonna take out real soon
We can't wait for June
We'll all be gone for the summer
We're on safari to stay
A bushy bushy blond hairdo
Ventura County's line
Santa Cruz and Trestle
We'll all be planning that route
We're gonna take real soon
We're waxing down our surfboards
We can't wait for June
We're all be gone for the summer
We're all suffering to stay
She's just like a storm
She blew in like the wind
Became more than just a friend
And now I just can't wait to see her face again
And her smile's like the sunset
I can feel the rain all over my face
She's just like a storm
The girl is a perfect storm...
I can feel the rain all over my face
She's just like a storm
She's just like a storm
She's just like a storm
She's just like a storm
I've been waiting to see you
I'm afraid that it's too late but I'm still hanging on
It's been so long since I've seen you
Can someone take me home
Do your days feel empty
Do you at the photographs
The ones that use to make us laugh
Is it worth a life time of pain and separation
How can we forgive when all we want is...
I shut you out of me life
Erased you from my mind
But I still feel you inside
Do you know how much I love you
Can someone take me home
Do your days feel empty
Do you look at the photographs
The ones that use to make us laugh
Is it worth a life time of pain and separation
How can we forgive when all we want is vindication
And do your days feel empty
Do you look at the photographs
The ones that use to make us laugh
Is it worth a life time of pain and separation
How can we forgive when all we want is vindication
Maybe your the one who is the only secret I keep
There's no one like you
All the dreams you have I don't want any
We can fall in love and be together
On that day all my sadness will be all gone
Your the one in my life in my heart is my meaning of living
All my love you can keep feeling
That your the only person only one that I'm living with
Maybe your the one when it's dark alone with me
Holding hands dreaming of our feature
In this dream world has our dream inside it
Your the one in the hole world hole universe that's only for me
Maybe that place is too far
Maybe that place is very dangers
But I believe we'll survive
Never felt bad when we're together
Love will only for you and me
When I need someone to believe in
And you never ever let me down
You always come through
And I just wanna thank you for
Baby you get to my heart
Girl I wanna be where ever you are
Something I never had
You don't know where to run to
I'll be here for you with all my heart
Baby you get to my heart
Girl I wanna be where ever you are
Something that I never had
Taking control is your love
Can't believe how long I've waited
Without you in my life
I can see in your eyes
Baby you get to my heart
Girl I'm gonna be where ever you are
Something I never had
Don't go away just yet
If you leave me all alone you won't know
What I really meant to say just before you hit the road that
I don't want you to go home
I don't want to be alone
So tell me to go and I'll stick around. We can both watch this ship go down
Just don't leave me here tonight
If you came back to me and sang fa la la la to me now it would be alright
Just don't leave me here tonight
Alone. Waiting for you. Waiting by the phone
I can't let you deny. I won't let you try and hide
I don't want you to go home
I don't want to be alone
And the mercury climbs.
So tell me to go and I'll stick around. We can both watch this ship go down
Just don't leave me here tonight
If you came back to me and sang fa la la la to me now it would be alright
Just don't leave me here tonight
I don't want you to go home
I don't want to be alone
And the mercury climbs
And the mercury climbs
Sitting in your driveway
Staring down the street
Wondering if you're ever gonna come and talk to me
Dreaming in your peaceful nest
Smiling. Loving peacefulness
You just sit there and wait for me to come and talk to you
I wish that it were easier
I wish that I could say
Hiding in those midnight eyes
I guess I'll sit here and wait for you to come and talk to me
I'll just sit here and wait for you to come and talk to me
Know that I should say something
Estimating my timing with you
I'm taking guesses and wagering bets from the outside
I've been thinking of ways to tell you this for a long time
I'm wondering if everything will be the same
And I'm calculating guesses in this guessing game
I'm looking at the odds from the outside
I'm thinking that everything is gonna change
That's the risk that I take
I'm kissing your face
It looks so good in my dreams
Know that I should say something
I'm wondering if everything will be the same
And I'm calculating guesses in this guessing game
I'm looking at the odds from the outside
I'm thinking that everything is gonna change
That's the risk that I take
I'm wondering if everything will be the same
And I'm calculating guesses in this guessing game
I'm looking at the odds from the outside
I'm thinking that everything is gonna change
Branches blowing up. The sky falls down
It reminds me of the place I want to be where all I see is your
I might be the man who's a sucker for you
I can take it. I can wait for it
You have found my one track mind
I love everything you tell me
They flow right through me
I'm alive and I'm thanking you for this sunshine
With secrets kept and secrets told
Don't want to force you to feel things the way I see
I can take it. I can wait for it
You have found my one track mind
I love everything you tell me
They flow right through me
I'm alive and I'm thanking you for this sunshine
Here comes the rain. Its falling down on me
Better run for shelter or just wait it out and see what comes of this love
With my lover standing right beside me
I can take it. I can wait for it
You have found my one track mind
I love everything you tell me
They flow right through me
I'm alive and I'm thanking you for this sunshine
Thank God that you and I are alive and
Everything around us is like sunshine
Crazy thoughts are dancing through my brain as I'm lying here with you
Shifting. Sifting through the night before and
My clothes are on the floor
Then in my hazy state I'll find your number on my hand
Straight lines fade away with you
Street lights fade away to blue
And its bright enough to see that straight lines fade away with you
Trying hard to please me. It's so easy baby
Wipe that sleep out of your eyes
Then in my hazy state I'll find your number on my hand
Straight lines fade away with you
Street lights fade away to blue
And its bright enough to see that straight lines fade away
Let it in and let it out
Let it in and let it out
Straight lines fade away with you
Street lights fade away to blue
Straight lines fade away with you
And its bright enough to see that straight lines fade away
Straight lines fade away
Come on. Come back. Make me feel that
Come on. Come back. Make me feel... feel.
This is the luckiest day of our lives
If you hold those cards in arm I can't see the other hand
You got some crazy plans
Come on. Come back. Make me feel that
Come on. Come back. Make me feel...
This is the luckiest day of our lives
If you hold them all with one arm I can't see the other hand
Now I can see it was only in my dreams
Then I see the sky and thank god I'm alive.
This is the luckiest day of our lives
If you hold them all with one arm I can't see the other hand
And spend this luckiest day
And spend this luckiest day
And spend this luckiest day with me.
This is the luckiest day
This is the luckiest day
It's getting harder each day. You're not smiling too often
With a weight on your chest and a nail in the coffin
You try to express that the best is lost and you're looking for something better
While traces of light fade out of sight
From the crack in your boat and the red blue sky
You think home and wonder as you choke and go under
Don't leave it all behind
Hoping that you're gonna save my life
Just don't let me drown
Save me before you go
To hate myself around you is to hate the things about you
I don't understand what you were thinking or
How you thought that this was fine
Now I'm breathing alone but I'm breathing all right
I'm gonna have to find my way home tonight without you
Counting on you still to save my life
Can you save it or...
Don't let me drown my love.
I might not make it out this time
I might not make it out this time alive
Just don't let me drown
Save me before you go
Tell you that you're mine
Knowing you were mine once before
Far from this place you once loved
I don't know you and you don't understand
I guess its time for me to have to say the hardest thing I'll ever have to say to you
I'm in love with your kindness
I've said it once or twice
It's hard to go down easy when we're both so damn nice
It's a shitty situation and I know that you're concerned
I guess you'll never learn
Talk of love. Talk of joy
We had our fill. We had our fun
Now the only thing that's filling up is this liquid in my lungs
We've got to let it go
I'm not one to talk around the truth
I'm not one who doesn't say what he feels but
Feeling my heart break in two
Feeling my heart break with you
You always had so much love
I'm sorry for these words that I sow
They're the only ones I know
And the only way I know to say
I don't know you and you don't understand
I guess its time for me to have to say the hardest thing I'll ever have to say to you
I'm in love with your kindness
I've said it once or twice
It's hard to go down easy when we're both so damn nice
It's a shitty situation and I know that you're concerned
I guess you'll never learn
Talk of love. Talk of joy
We had our fill. We had our fun
Now the only thing that's filling up is this liquid in my lungs
We've got to let it go
Don't go away just yet
If you leave me all alone you won't know
What I really meant to say just before you hit the road that
I don't want you to go home
I don't want to be alone
So tell me to go and I'll stick around. We can both watch this ship go down
Just don't leave me here tonight
If you came back to me and sang fa la la la to me now it would be alright
Just don't leave me here tonight
Alone. Waiting for you. Waiting by the phone
I can't let you deny. I won't let you try and hide
I don't want you to go home
I don't want to be alone
And the mercury climbs.
So tell me to go and I'll stick around. We can both watch this ship go down
Just don't leave me here tonight
If you came back to me and sang fa la la la to me now it would be alright
Just don't leave me here tonight
I don't want you to go home
I don't want to be alone
And the mercury climbs
And the mercury climbs
I'm gonna go from a whisper to a yell
Its only half as good without you
Missing you to death is only half as good my darling
Only half as good as it can be
Help me help myself when you're away
Missing you this much isn't easy on my blood flow
Not as easy on this heart as it can be
A thousand words begin to pour but only you can say it more
Help me help myself when you're away
I'm gonna go from a a whisper to a yell
Its only half as good without you
Help me help myself when you're away
Step one. Take it easy. Its easy to do
Two. Keep thinking of me
Rinse and repeat those previous two
It's how I roll. It's what I do to help me help myself when you're away
Its only half as good without you babe
Help me help myself when you're away
Don't know what you're getting into tonight but you're looking alright to me
Don't know what you're getting into tonight but you're looking mighty fine to me
Don't be surprised by this look in my eyes as I'm tracking you down when you make my heart go
Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom.
Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom.
I'm gonna ask the same of you
I'll be grating my cheese for you
Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom.
Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom.
I'm gonna ask the same of you
And you make it go boom...
Let yourself go like there's nobody watching
Shake it and roll that ass with me
I'm gonna ask the same of you
Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom.
I don't understand why you're leaving this way
After all that we've done and all that you'd say
Every step of the way
It's burning me until I find scars
I can't make a sound so I'll try to find words that say
I can't find the words so I'll just make a sound and say
I just got back from an underground meeting
It's a secret clan with a funky donkey
The donkey. The banker. The funky donkey spanker.
The donkey. The banker. The funky donkey spanker.
Now the donkey's out of rehab with bills to pay
The filthy banker agrees but before they proceed
I'm a donkey spanker too
The donkey. The banker. The funky donkey spanker.
The donkey. The banker. The funky donkey spanker.
Now the donkey. The banker. The funky donkey spanker.
It's the donkey. The banker. The funky donkey spanker.
The donkey. The banker. The little donkey spanker.
I was sitting by the phone
I was waiting all alone
It's a dark and dreary night
And I sit all alone impatiently
You were here and now you're gone
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking
Please forgive and then forget
And I sit all alone impatiently
Day is dawning and I must go
You're asleep but still I'm sure you'll know
Why it had to end this way
You and I had a groovy time
But I told you somewhere down the line
You would have to find me gone
I just have to move along
Waiting in the morning rain
Lord give my restless soul a little patience
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
When you wake I know you'll cry
And the words I wrote to say goodbye
They won't comfort you at all
But in time you will understand
That the dreams we dreamed were made of sand
To live is to be free
Waiting in the morning rain
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
I can see your face in all of my dreams
When I hear your voice I know what it means
I know it doesn't matter just how hard I try
You're all the reason for my life
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down
Did I see your face somewhere in the crowd
I can stop myself from crying out loud
They say my wound will heal and only leave a scar
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
Man has always wanted a woman by his side to keep him company
Women always knew that it takes a man to get matrimonial harmony
Gotta have love to carry on living
Gotta have love till eternity
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
Flowers in the desert need a drop of rain like a woman needs her man
If a man's in love and his woman wants the moon
Then hell it down if he can
Somebody who loves you and somebody who cares
Gotta have love to carry on living
You can have peace if you understand
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
I saw it in the mirror
That I'm no longer needed
Anyone can take my place
I saw it in the mirror
When I look into my eyes
I saw it in the mirror
My head is hanging low
And I ain't too familiar
With the feelings that I show
I know you say you love me
But I'm looking through your lies
It doesn't really bother you
I never thought I could cry for you
I saw it in the mirror
That I'm no longer needed
Anyone can take my place
I saw it in the mirror
When I look into my eyes
Every day in the morning on her way to the office
You can see as she catches a train
Just a face among a million faces
Just another woman with no name
Not the girl you'd remember but she's still something special
If you knew her I am sure you'd agree
Friday evening she turns out to be...
This is the moment she's waited for
This is the part that she likes to play
But she knows the fun would go away
If she would play it every day
So she's back every morning to her work at the office
And another week to live in a dream
And another row of early mornings
Everybody seems to think she's a bore
But they wouldn't know her little secret
What her Friday night would have in store...
This is the moment she's waited for
This is the part that she likes to play
She would like to play it every day
This is the moment she's waited for
He leaves every morning
But if I would have to choose
I wouldn't let you go
Just give it some more time
And you will see our love will grow
We gotta have patience
Love isn't just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
Love is the reason for living
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
I've treated you like a queen
Just look at that cat
You'd think he was an angel
But if I would have to choose
I wouldn't let you go
Just give it some more time
And you will see our love will grow
We gotta have patience
Love isn't just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
Love is the reason for living
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
Well there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all my memories
Those were my happiest days
I remember all the games we used to play
We were the best of friends
We found a place in the sun
Well there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Wildest kids you could see
We would play together
Yes there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all my memories
Those were my happiest days
And such they liked to play
And I guess I didn't like it very much
I was happy and proud
I found a place in the sun
Well there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Wildest kids you could see
We would play together
Climbing the apple tree
Yes there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all my memories
I was a fighter always looking for trouble
And my life was so empty
There was nothing left to live for
But then it happened one night
As I got into a fight
I could hear someone saying
You might need his help one day
We depend on one another
Love him that's the only way
On the road that we're going
We all need words of comfort and compassion
I was a woman never thinking of others
And my life was so lonely
Didn't care for anybody
But then I happened to meet
A begging man in the street
As I turned down his praying
You might need his help one day
We depend on one another
Love him that's the only way
On the road that we're going
We all need words of comfort and compassion
And it means something special to me
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me
How lucky can one fellow be
Who could ever believe that she would be mine
And when we go for a walk in the park
Then she holds me and squeezes my hand
About all the things that we plan
Who could ever believe that she would be mine
Who could ever believe that she would be mine
And if she ever leaves me what could I do
It's an evil world that has only made me a girl
It's a funny feeling when you get to love someone
And thinking that he'll never look your way
It's so much more than any words can say
Sitting in the darkest corner
In the candlelight I saw saw her face
She was looking so sad and lonely
That I knew I could do
It's a beautiful place this world
Come on baby let's dance
Let me show you that I know how
Come on baby let's dance
Come on baby let's dance
You've been sitting there for hours
Try to hide behind the flowers now
Yes I know that you will
It's a beautiful place this world
Come on baby let's dance
Let me show you that I know how
Come on baby let's dance
Come on baby let's dance
I have tried in vain never had success
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost my only friend
Now it seems I have to start again
I wish that I knew it
Wish I had found somebody to care for
Life is so lonely if life is just only
Looking for someone who would want to stay
I might find her with a bit of luck one day
But who knows so until then
I can only try and try again
I wish that I knew it
Wish I had found somebody to care for
Life is so lonely if life is just only
I wish that I knew it
Wish I had found somebody to care for
Life is so lonely if life is just only
I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
How I wish this road would take me home where I belong
I'm tired and all my dreams have failed along the way
I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
Though I wonder what my folks would think about me now
Santa Rosa I'll be back to stay...
Santa Rosa I'll be back to stay
I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
How I wish to see the old house where I used to live
How I regret the day when I set out to roam
Santa Rosa I'll be back to stay...
Santa Rosa I'll be back to stay
I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
The history book on the shelf is always repeating itself
I feel like I win when I lose
I feel like I win when I lose
Looking down at people passing by
They just stare at me and wonder why
I'll be the bluest of men in this town
Waiting for those little words from you
People laugh and point their fingers
Like I was a monkey at the zoo
Feeling angry at the silly crowd
You should know by now I'm far too proud
You shouldn't treat me like you always do
I'll be the bluest of men in this town
Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine
Jeanie Jeanie on my mind
Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine
Jeanie Jeanie on my mind
Well I was looking at a movie on the TV last night
I really had to write a song about it
I know that everybody's gonna shout it
And what a dreadful mighty killer
A big black wild gorilla
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song
Now we can make the jungle out of any old place
So let your arms hang down
And waddle all around
Like a dreadful mighty killer
A big black wild gorilla
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song
Like a dreadful mighty killer
A big black wild gorilla
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song
Where is the spring and the summer
But still my love for you will live forever
We'll find a way to face a new tomorrow
I can't do without you
Where is the dream we were dreaming
And all the nights we shared
And I can't tell you just how much I miss you
We'll find a way to face a new tomorrow
I can't do without you
I can't do without you
Tried to sneak out without saying
With my loudest record playing
Dying for my friend to hold me
How I wanna live my life
Oh I wanna live my life
Oh I wanna live my life
Dance while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow
A thing to remember when we're all alone
Dance while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
God knows that we've been trying
So dance while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye
Yet it seems to make me sad
Dance while the music still goes on
Just like the night I met you
You know I won't forget you
So dance while the music still goes on
It's gonna be our last goodbye
Dance while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow
A thing to remember when we're all alone
So dance while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye
Dance while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
God knows that we've been trying
Dance while the music still goes on
Just like the night I met you
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
The way that you kiss goodnight
The way that you hold me tight
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing
I don't wanna see you cry
You better not get too high
You'll never get rid of me
There's no other place in this world
Where I rather would be
You better not get too high
There's no other place in this world
Where I rather would be
And now I know what they mean
You're a love machine
You move like a flame of fire
Your eyes like a flash of lightning
The answer to all desire
You'd better watch out
I said you'd better watch out
Anywhere you go I'll find you
I'll be staying close behind you
And I'm tired of waiting
Yes it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading
I said you'd better watch out
It's been kind of funny lately
You act like I was a stranger
I think you're beginning to hate me
But then you're a girl in danger
You'd better watch out
Anywhere you go I'll find you
I'll be staying close behind you
And I've tired of waiting
Yes it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading
So you'd better watch out
Yes I said you'd better watch out
And I'm tired of waiting
Yes it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading
I said you'd better watch out
Oh girl you'd better watch out
And then I heard them laugh and say
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way
Putting themselves on test
Didn't know what to answer or what to say
One of those spacemen in his way
And if you laugh at them
Then there's only a thing I can say
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way
Putting themselves on test
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way
Putting themselves on test
You say she's been mad at you
Still I see that she makes you blue
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life
Just to be where you wanna be
To be close for eternity
What a miracle to happen
I know she doesn't make it easy
Would she care if you lingered
We could make it right
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life
I know she doesn't make it easy
Suzy was nine and I was ten
Right at the time when boys like to think they're men
She used to follow us at school
We really thought that she was a little fool
And one day we said to her
We don't want to hurt you girl
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure
So get off our playground and stay away
That's all that we've got to say
Suzy went home to Mama's arms
So get off her back and let her be
We really didn't know what to say
But as soon as she went away
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure
So get off our playground and stay away
That's all that we've got to say
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure
So get off our playground and stay away
That's all that we've got to say
I know just how to whisper
And I know just how to cry
I know just where to find the answers
And I know just how to lie
I know just how to fake it
And I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth
And then I know just when to dream
And I know just where to touch you
And I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer
And I know when to let you loose
And I know the night is fading
And I know that time's gonna fly
And I'm never gonna tell you everything
But I know I've got to give it a try
And I know the roads to riches
And I know the ways to fame
And I always know the name of the game
But I don't know how to leave you
And I'll never let you fall
And I don't know how you do it
Every time I see you all the rays of the sun
Are streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim
At your eyes like a spotlight
And it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
And turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright
I can make the runner stumble
I can make the final block
I can make all the stadiums rock
I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone
But I'm never gonna make it without you
And I'm never gonna make it like you do
I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
Blue since the day we parted
I've been angry and sad about the things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
Blue since the day we parted
Blue since the day we parted
So at last you're free
It's the way you wanted it to be
And the price you paid
To become a woman of today
Is it worth the pain to see the children cry
Does it hurt when they ask for Daddy
Now you live on your own
Can you make it alone
So you're free at last
And beginning to forget the past
So you fight to find your freedom
Now you live on your own
Can you make it alone
What's the matter with you
Don't you know what to do
Now you live on your own
Can you make it alone
What's the matter with you
Don't you know what to do
Now you live on your own
Beautiful gardens full of
Won't you come to my land
The grass is mellow and the
My paradise is waiting
In the shade of a tree
That's where my land is
Won't you come to me soon
I'll show you everything
Where are those happy days
They seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you
But you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love
It used to be so nice
It used to be so good
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
Though you are standing near
You made me feel alive
But something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
What happened to our love
It used to be so good
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
Did you see that man in the limousine
Just as long as he pays the bill
Did you see that man with a fat cigar
He just left his lunch with a belly full of lobster and caviar
He can choose the wine from a vintage year
He will drink champagne in his limousine
When the rest of us drink a beer
Just like a spider in a cobweb
He's never bothered by his conscience
But you see that man made a big mistake
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake
But he can't buy an honest friend
Just like a spider in a cobweb
He's never bothered by his conscience
Making somebody happy is a question of give and take
Every smile and every little touch
Don't you know that they mean so much
Sweet sweet kisses so tender
Always will return to sender
You'll get love in return
Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care
Never use it as a selfish tool
Never ever be such a fool
Every feeling you're showing
Is a boomerang you're throwing
You'll get love in return
And if you're warm and tender
Make your choice but believe me
So love me or leave me
Make your choice but believe me
Wanna be wanna be in my baby's arms
Nice and gentle if you want me to
Just as long as I'm in love with you
With you baby every single night
I can teach you how to rock all right
I thought I would no more
Manage to hit the ceiling
You brought it back to me
You make me think that you
Possibly could release me
I think you'll be able to
Make all my dreams come true
You're something I'd been pleading for
I lay my life before you
I'll have you want me more and more
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I've been waiting for you
You're gonna feel so fine
You'll never want to leave me
I feel you belong to me
Someday you will agree
You're something I'd been pleading for
I lay my life before you
I'll have you want me more and more
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I've been waiting for you
You think you're gonna make me softer with your fancy car
But I can tell you all your tricks ain't gonna get you far
They say that money's got a magic touch
You won't have me tonight
You can't buy me with your money
But I'll never be your girl
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
You didn't have to send me flowers like you did today
The girls might fall for everything you've got
You won't have me tonight
You can't buy me with your money
But I'll never be your girl
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
I was out for the morning sun
Couldn't sleep so I thought I'd take a walk
I was thinking of you and me
I could hardly believe my eyes
When I saw this guy closing your front door
Had a feeling of emptiness
Like I've never had before
As he disappeared in his car
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do
Everything I had ever been
Everything in my life's a part of you
And I just couldn't move my feet
So I stood on the pavement as you came out
You acted as you didn't know
What it was all about
Baby how could you do it
You just told me lies
Baby how could you tell me
I was stupid to believe you
I was blind but now I see
Then you smiled and you took my hand
And one of them is my brother Joe.
He's been gone for a long long time
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay.
You'll be seeing a lot of him
I said me and my buddy gonna pick a bale of cotton
Now me and my buddy gonna pick a bale a day
I said me and my buddy gonna pick a bale of cotton
Now me and my buddy gonna pick a bale a day
All covered with snow
Is worse than a thief
All covered with snow
Hear the ding dong ring
You go marching to the table
See the same old thing
See the fork on the table
If you say a thing about it
You're in trouble with the man
Let the midnight special
Let the midnight special
If you ever go to Houston
Well you'd better act right
And you'd better not gamble
And you'd better not fight
For the sheriff will arrest you
And he'll take you down
And before you understand it
Let the midnight special shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Let the midnight special shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
When I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed
When I kissed the teacher
All my friends at school
When I kissed the teacher
Couldn't quite believe his eyes
When I kissed the teacher
My whole class went wild
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
I was in a trance when I kissed the teacher
Suddenly I took the chance when I kissed the teacher
And I couldn't help it
I just had to kiss the teacher
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
Gonna show him I care
Gonna teach him you a lesson alright
When I kissed the teacher
All my sense had flown away
When I kissed the teacher
My whole class went wild
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher
When I kissed the teacher
When I kissed the teacher
When I kissed the teacher
When I kissed the teacher
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights are low
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
Leave them burning and then you're gone
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
I've seen it on your face
So now we'll go separate ways
Like an image passing by
In the mirror of your eyes
I can see it all so clearly
Like reflections of your mind
Are the words you try to find
But I know I don't possess you
You are still my love and my life
Still my one and only
I've watched you look away
Sitting here close to you
Knowing that maybe tonight we're through
Like an image passing by
In the mirror of your eyes
I can see it all so clearly
Like reflections of your mind
Are the words you try to find
But I know I don't possess you
You are still my love and my life
And it sounds better now
And you're only smiling
When you play your violin
To be so near you and not just hear you
And we'd be together all the time
But I think you don't know that I exist
From the day when I first listened to you
And you're only smiling
When you play your violin
To be so near you and not just hear you
And we'd be together all the time
To be so near you and not just hear you
And we'd be together all the time
No more carefree laughter
There is nothing we can do
In these old familiar rooms children would play
There is nothing we can do
There is nothing we can do
To pay the bills I have to pay
And still there never seems to be
A single penny left for me
In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all
I'd fool around and have a ball
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
A man like that is hard to find
But I can't get him off my mind
And if he happens to be free
I bet he wouldn't fancy me
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game
My life will never be the same
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
Are you sure you wanna hear more
What if I ain't worth the while
Not the style you'd be looking for
Things look different in the morning light
I'm jealous and I'm proud
If you hurt my feelings I'll cry out loud
Are you sure you wanna hear more
Would I be the one you seek
Mild and meek like the girl next door
I may be an angel in disguise
It's lonely to be free
Sweet nothings in my ear
But I do believe in sympathy
Are you sure you wanna hear more
Won't you have a drink with me
Just to see you're not really sore
I'm just not the girl to hide my face
There's a special love
Like an eagle flying with a dove
I'll find it in the end
So you were looking for someone to hold
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
It's better to forget me
Men are toys in the game that you play
Falling in love with a woman like you
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
Never walk alone after midnight
If you don't believe it you better beware
Some of us will dream it forever
Look around the corner and try not to scream
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
You're forever trapped in the alleys
Look into the shadows and you'll see the shape
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
I remember long ago another starry night like this
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
There was something in the air that night
They were shining there for you and me
Though I never thought that we could lose
If I had to do the same again
If I had to do the same again
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
There was something in the air that night
They were shining there for you and me
Though I never thought that we could lose
If I had to do the same again
There was something in the air that night
They were shining there for you and me
Though I never thought that we could loose
If I had to do the same again
Early this morning I drove in the rain
Out to the airport to get on the plane
After all I've had to go through
Guess I've been working a little too hard
In a few hours the plane will descend
I can imagine the beach and the sand
Walking with someone and holding his hand
After all I've had to go through
I've got a feeling the dream will come true
Somebody's waiting and I'll forget you
They came flying from far away
Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell
They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
Over mountains and forests and seas
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
Over mountains and forests and seas
If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down
When the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best
If you put me to the test
As long as we're together
Get to know you better
You want me to leave it there
Afraid of a love affair
If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down
When the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best
If you put me to the test
Know I'm gonna get you
You don't wanna hurt me
I ain't gonna let you
You say that I waste my time
But I can't get you off my mind
If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down
When the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best
Gotta put me to the test
Gonna do my very best
Gotta put me to the test
Gonna do my very best
Gotta put me to the test
Though I would have liked to begin
You leave and you slam the door
Like you've done many times before
And I cry and I feel so helpless
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me to the end
Outside I can see the sun through the open window
Inside everything feels so cold
Sometimes when I just can't cope
I cling to a desperate hope
And I cry and I feel like dying
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me to the end
The sound of the key in the door
Our love is a precious thing
Worth the pain and the suffering
And it's never too late for changing
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me to the end
You and me to the end
I see the path from this dark place
Only a week since we started
It seems to me for every time
I was an impossible case
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
What I'm trying to conceal
Now the lights are going out
And I'm never invited
I don't know what I'm talking to you
No wonder I get excited
And the way you see through me
But it means a lot to me
What I'm trying to conceal
Would you laugh at me
Like a roller in the ocean
Like a wind that's always blowing
Like the sunrise in the morning
How I treasure every minute
With the urge to move on
It seems we're on a journey
A trip through space and time
And somewhere lies the answer
To all the questions why
What really makes the difference
Between all dead and living things
The will to stay alive
With the urge to move on
The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea
The crying of the seagulls that hover over me
I see it and I hear it
But how can I explain
The wonder of the moment
With the urge to move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Like the sunrise in the morning
With the urge to move on
And you think you're cursed
To fill the hole in your soul
To fill the hole in your soul
When I meet my friends
To fill the hole in your soul
To fill the hole in your soul
And then you find it all comes out too bright
You know it's only a lie
The songs you sing are too romantic
And when you want the truth
They only spit in your eye
To fill the hole in your soul
And you think you're cursed
To fill the hole in your soul
To fill the hole in your soul
To fill the hole in your soul
To fill the hole in your soul
To fill the hole in your soul
To fill the hole in your soul
This park and these houses
Old streets I have walked
My friends will get married
Have children and homes
Well planned and wise
Never expecting surprises
One chance in a lifetime
My friends and my family
This dull little town
Boys that I've kissed
Everything old and familiar
One chance in a lifetime
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
I wanna sing it out to everybody
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
So I say thank you for the music
That's what everybody's telling me
Pushed around refugee
Got a feeling that I don't belong
As if I have come from outer space
Out of place like King Kong
Just as long as I sing
Just a silly old clown
Like a puppet with no will at all
And somebody taught me how to talk
Just as long as I sing
Just a silly old clown
You look better on the photograph
Just as long as I sing
Just a silly old clown
That's what everybody's telling me
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
I wanna sing it out to everybody
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
So I say thank you for the music
I'll never know why I had to go
Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here
And keeping it that way is my intention
As good as new and growing too
Just like it used to be and even better
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep
How could I make such a dumb mistake
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here
And keeping it that way is my intention
As good as new and growing too
Just like it used to be and even better
I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again
And keeping it that way is my intention
As good as new and growing too
Just like it used to be and even better
Yes the love I have for you feels as good as new
A sense of expectation hanging in the air
Across the room your eyes are glowing in the dark
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
I know what you think
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
Something good in everything I see
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness still another mile
Something good in everything I see
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I'll cross the stream
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
Something good in everything I see
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I'll cross the stream
Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Then I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
He took my heart and now I pay the price
You'll think you're in paradise
Then one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
I believe your new girl turned you down
And they say she's pushing you around
Tell me my friend how many nights you cried
Disaster and disgrace
The word is all around
He's clumsy like a clown
The world is upside down
The king has lost his crown
Was it hard to step down from your throne
And to know tonight you're all alone
Disaster and disgrace
The king has lost his crown
He's clumsy like a clown
The world is upside down
The king has lost his crown
Disaster and disgrace
The world is all around
He's clumsy like a clown
The world is upside down
The king has lost his crown
Disaster and disgrace
The world is all around...
So you're blue but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
If you think it's funny
Take it nice and slow
I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one
If you think it's funny
Take it nice and slow
If you think it's funny
If you think it's funny
If you think it's funny
Keeping me so busy all the day through
They're the things that keep me from thinking of you
And I lose my temper ten times a day
Still it's even worse when the night's on its way
Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights
I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall
Sitting here alone and staring at the wall
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights
Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights
I was not prepared for something like this
I got my business to help me through the day
Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights
I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall
Sitting here alone and staring at the wall
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights
Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights
If it wasn't for the nights
If it wasn't for the nights
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights
Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights
If it wasn't for the nights
If it wasn't for the nights
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you've broken a feather
I hope we can patch it up together
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Try once more like you did before
So the walls came tumbling down
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle
There is no way you can deny it
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Try once more like you did before
Try once more like you did before
It was in the papers today
Some physician had made a discovery
She said that every result she had backed her
Claiming that love's a longevity factor
What a feeling when I hold you tight
So why don't we start right away
We've got a reason for each time we're kissing
What a feeling when I hold you tight
We've got a reason for each time we're kissing
What a feeling when I hold you tight
Lay your head on my chest so you hear every beat of my heart
Now there's nothing at all that can keep us apart
I'm at the point of no returning
I've had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this
When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong
Still it's making me scared that my love is so strong
Losing you is a nightmare fate and to me it's new
Never before did you see me begging for more
I'm at the point of no returning
I've had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this
I'm at the point of no returning
I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss
I'm at the point of no returning
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone
I love the feeling in the air
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Scattered driftwood on the beach
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter
And I can feel your love everywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
How I remember the first time we went to the movies
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter
And I can feel your love everywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
And I can feel your love everywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
Everything about you is right
Let it glow and let it be bright
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
I open the window and I gaze into the night
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
I open the window and I gaze into the night
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
No more carefree laughter
There is nothing we can do
In these old familiar rooms children would play
There is nothing we can do
There is nothing we can do
If you change your mind
I'm the first in line

I'd fool around and have a ball
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world

It's a rich man's world
A man like that is hard to find
But I can't get him off my mind

In the rich man's world

It's a rich man's world
Wanna be wanna be in my baby's arms
Nice and gentle if you want me to
Just as long as I'm in love with you
With you baby every single night
I can teach you how to rock all right
They came flying from far away
Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell
They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas

I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
Over mountains and forests and seas
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze

Then one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights are low
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
Leave them burning and then you're gone
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
So you're blue but I can't take a chance on a chick like you

So I say thank you for the music
Super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
Suddenly I feel all right
And it's gonna be so different when I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
Part of a success that never ends
Still I'm thinking about you only
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
But it's gonna be all right
Everything will be so different when I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms and hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
Super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
About the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Thinking I'd be strong there
The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
But tell me does she kiss
Does it feel the same
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all
If it makes you feel sad
You've come to shake my hand
If it makes you feel bad
So the winner takes it all
And the loser has to fall
I was at a party and this fella said to me
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Over in the corner I could see this other guy
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar
And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
I said I was not exactly waiting for the bus
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Standing up is scary if you think you're gonna fall
I say if you ever want to know what's going on
Touch me gently like a summer evening breeze
Just let the feeling grow
Make your fingers soft and light
Let your body be the velvet of the night
Go slowly with me now
Play me time and time again and make me strong
Tread lightly on my ground
Oh please don't let me down
There's a shimmer in your eyes
Like the feeling of a thousand butterflies
And let me float away
Play me time and time again and make me strong
Tread lightly on my ground
Oh please don't let me down
Tread lightly on my ground
Oh please don't let me down
Sometimes when I'm mad
There's a part of me that seems to be a little sad
Sometimes when I scream
Part of me is acting while the other stands beside
We're like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes we're a hit together
Gloomy moods and inspiration
Were a funny combination
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute
And you'll find the answer in it
Sometimes I have toyed
With ideas that I got from good old Dr. Freud
Nothing new of course
It may seem to you I try to break through open doors
I just wanna say a lot of that applies to me
We're like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes we're a hit together
Gloomy moods and inspiration
Were a funny combination
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute
And you'll find the answer in it
We're like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes we're a hit together
Gloomy moods and inspiration
Were a funny combination
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute
And you'll find the answer in it
We're like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes we're a hit together
Gloomy moods and inspiration
Were a funny combination
And the fireworks are through
Feeling lost and feeling blue
It's the end of the party
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
And he thinks he'll be okay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend
That the dreams we had before
Than confetti on the floor
It's the end of a decade
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend
The summer air was soft and warm
Did it's best to please us
Smiled like Mona Lisa
It was a fine and true romance
I can still recall our last summer
We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
But underneath we had a fear of flying
Like we were dancing our last dance
I can still recall our last summer
We could laugh and play
And now you're working in a bank
And your name is Harry
Yet you're the hero of my dreams
I can still recall our last summer
I can still recall our last summer
We could laugh and play
They came from the hills
And they came from the valleys and the plains
They struggled in the cold
In the heat and the snow and in the rain
Came to hear him play
Play their minds away
We're all following a strange melody
We're all summoned by a tune
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon
They came from the south
From the west and the north and from the east
They waited for the man
Like a parish is waiting for the priest
Longed to hear him play
Play their minds away
We're all following a strange melody
We're all summoned by a tune
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon
He seduced everybody in the land
And the fear was a weapon in his hand
Play their minds away
We're all following a strange melody
We're all summoned by a tune
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon
I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
You and I can share the silence
Finding comfort together
The way old friends do
And after fights and words of violence
We make up with each other
The way old friends do
Times of joy and times of sorrow
We will always see it through
Oh I don't care what comes tomorrow
We can face it together
The way old friends do
You and I can share the silence
Finding comfort together
The way old friends do
And after fights and words of violence
We make up with each other
The way old friends do
Times of joy and times of sorrow
We will always see it through
Oh I don't care what comes tomorrow
We can face it together
The way old friends do
We can face it together
The way old friends do
We can face it together
The way old friends do
We can face it together
The way old friends do
We can face it together
It's a dead end street
They tie your hands and tie your feet
And the street is narrow
You know they're gonna get you
You try to break away
But they will never let you
It's a dead end street
They tie your hands and tie your feet
And the street is narrow
You're like a goldfish in a bowl
It really doesn't matter
You've done it all before
By now they know the pattern
It's a dead end street
They tie your hands and tie your feet
And the street is narrow
You're like a goldfish in a bowl
You know they're gonna get you
You know they'll never let you
It's a dead end street
They tie your hands and tie your feet
And the street is narrow
You're like a goldfish in a bowl
They'll take your soul
You know they're gonna get you
Put on your white sombrero
Saddle your horse my dear
And ride off into the sunset
For there is no place for you here
Like and old fashioned hero
You think our life is a movie
I live and feel and I can do without you
Put on your white sombrero
Think of this day as a showdown
This is the end for me and you
Now be a bold vaquero
Don't show your feelings
I'll cry while you're disappearing
All dressed in white unchained and free without me
Put on your white sombrero
Like all the cowboys do
Who'll never speak harshly to you
You're such a caballero
I want someone who will take me
I need a man who is in rhyme
I need a man who is in rhyme
I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence
Among the things I love so dearly
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
And I'm close to fainting
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
And I'm close to fainting
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
And I'm close to fainting
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
And I'm close to fainting
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
I have a very good friend
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
You hear her voice everywhere
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
Exert that will of your own
Now we'd better hurry
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
You hear her voice everywhere
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
Here's to us one more toast and then we'll pay the bill
Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done
In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done
It's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor
With nothing left untried
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done
Is it true that the beast is waking
Stirring in his restless sleep tonight
In the pale moonlight
In the grip of this cold December
You and I have reason to remember
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I don't sing
They blow their horns and march along
They drum their drums and look so strong
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I won't sing
Let's not look the other way
In the distance but drawing near
All that thunder and the blinding light
In the grip of this cold December
You and I have reason to remember
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I don't sing
They blow their horns and march along
They drum their drums and look so strong
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I won't sing
Let's not look the other way
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I won't sing
Let's not look the other way
No poet has ever painted
So strange yet we're so well acquainted
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day
Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night I find myself
A blind man in some ancient valley
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day
Where I'm one with every grand illusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when a day dies
I surrender without reservation
I take it to me and let it flow through me
All of those great romances
Robbing me of my rightful chances
And so I dealt you the blow
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
Wishing she had never left at all
As a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away
From the heat and the action
Stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
Now I've changed and I want you to know
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
Wishing she had never left at all
I'll never left at all
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
He had what you might call a trivial occupation
He cleaned the platforms of the local railway station
With no romance in his life
Sometimes he wished he had a wife
He read the matrimonial advertising pages
But they had nothing to say
At least not until the day
When something special he read
If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
The voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting
He was amazed at his luck
The purest streak of gold he'd struck
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling
Why don't we meet for a chat
The three of us in my flat
If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two
For the price of one...
And I have to sit down for a while
The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl
Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Then when she's gone there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny
What happened to the wonderful adventures
And why I just don't know
Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Schoolbag in hand she leaves home in the early morning
Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace
Dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
Like an angel passing through my room
Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined
Playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
Like an angel passing through my room
And my twilight images go by
He stands towering over me
Tells me I must take him seriously
Droning on the usual way
He's such a clever guy
Then I wonder should I laugh or cry
In the striped pajamas that I bought
Of his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does
And me I get so tired
And I wonder should I laugh or cry
High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes
In the warm and safe cocoon
So should I laugh or cry
Dangerously indifferent I have grown
Pain where there was pain before
Far away he rambles on
I feel my throat go dry
Then I wonder should I laugh or cry
High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes
In the warm and safe cocoon
I must have read the morning paper going into town
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
The day before you came
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
The day before you came
And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
Down in the street they're all singing and shouting
Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone on your bed
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you
But then again you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us could
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
You're grieving deeply but still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it but you know your fate
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us could
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us could
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Don't know how to take it
Don't know where to go
My resistance running low
And every day the hold is getting tighter
And it troubles me so
I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me
I don't have a strategy
It's just like taking candy from a baby
And I think I must be
Thinking nothing can stop him now
This is getting crazy
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what could happen
Where I'd be if I fell
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
Seems to me you shine your light
Down to me to say goodnight
Twinkle twinkle my old friend
Sleep is waiting round the bend
While you travel through the Milky Way
Twinkle twinkle twinkle little star
Raindrops on a window pane
Stillness of a summer rain
Silently the haze drifts through the trees
Slowly dawn is breaking through
Yet a morning without you
Curtains rustling in the breeze
I'm still trapped within my dreams
Daylight makes its way into my mind
Yet another morning without you
Finally when darkness falls Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace
Dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
Like an angel passing through my room
Half awake and half in dreams seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined
Playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom Like an angel passing through my room
And my twilight images go by
Like an angel passing through my room
Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace
Dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
Like an angel passing through my room
Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined
Playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
Like an angel passing through my room
And my twilight images go by
I was sitting by the phone
I was waiting all alone
It's a dark and dreary night
And I sit all alone impatiently
You were here and now you're gone
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking
Please forgive and then forget
And I sit all alone impatiently
The history book on the shelf is always repeating itself
I feel like I win when I lose
I feel like I win when I lose
You think you're gonna make me softer with your fancy car
But I can tell you all your tricks ain't gonna get you far
They say that money's got a magic touch
You won't have me tonight
You can't buy me with your money
But I'll never be your girl
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
You didn't have to send me flowers like you did today
The girls might fall for everything you've got
You won't have me tonight
You can't buy me with your money
But I'll never be your girl
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
Make your choice but believe me
So love me or leave me
Make your choice but believe me
Where are those happy days
They seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you
But you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love
It used to be so nice
It used to be so good
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
Though you are standing near
You made me feel alive
But something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
What happened to our love
It used to be so good
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
Blue since the day we parted
I've been angry and sad about the things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
Blue since the day we parted
Blue since the day we parted
I remember long ago another starry night like this
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
There was something in the air that night
They were shining there for you and me
Though I never thought that we could lose
If I had to do the same again
If I had to do the same again
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
There was something in the air that night
They were shining there for you and me
Though I never thought that we could lose
If I had to do the same again
There was something in the air that night
They were shining there for you and me
Though I never thought that we could loose
If I had to do the same again
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights are low
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
Leave them burning and then you're gone
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
To pay the bills I have to pay
And still there never seems to be
A single penny left for me
In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all
I'd fool around and have a ball
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
A man like that is hard to find
But I can't get him off my mind
And if he happens to be free
I bet he wouldn't fancy me
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game
My life will never be the same
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
No more carefree laughter
There is nothing we can do
In these old familiar rooms children would play
There is nothing we can do
There is nothing we can do
If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down
When the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best
If you put me to the test
As long as we're together
Get to know you better
You want me to leave it there
Afraid of a love affair
If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down
When the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best
If you put me to the test
Know I'm gonna get you
You don't wanna hurt me
I ain't gonna let you
You say that I waste my time
But I can't get you off my mind
If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down
When the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best
Gotta put me to the test
Gonna do my very best
Gotta put me to the test
Gonna do my very best
Gotta put me to the test
Only a week since we started
It seems to me for every time
I was an impossible case
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
What I'm trying to conceal
Now the lights are going out
And I'm never invited
I don't know what I'm talking to you
No wonder I get excited
And the way you see through me
But it means a lot to me
What I'm trying to conceal
Would you laugh at me
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone
I love the feeling in the air
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Scattered driftwood on the beach
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you've broken a feather
I hope we can patch it up together
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Try once more like you did before
So the walls came tumbling down
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle
There is no way you can deny it
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Try once more like you did before
Try once more like you did before
So you're blue but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
If you think it's funny
Take it nice and slow
I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one
If you think it's funny
Take it nice and slow
If you think it's funny
If you think it's funny
If you think it's funny
A sense of expectation hanging in the air
Across the room your eyes are glowing in the dark
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
I know what you think
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
I open the window and I gaze into the night
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
Something good in everything I see
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness still another mile
Something good in everything I see
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I'll cross the stream
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
Something good in everything I see
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I'll cross the stream
About the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Thinking I'd be strong there
The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
But tell me does she kiss
Does it feel the same
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all
If it makes you feel sad
You've come to shake my hand
If it makes you feel bad
So the winner takes it all
And the loser has to fall
Super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
Suddenly I feel all right
And it's gonna be so different when I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
Part of a success that never ends
Still I'm thinking about you only
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
But it's gonna be all right
Everything will be so different when I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms and hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
Super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
All of those great romances
Robbing me of my rightful chances
And so I dealt you the blow
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
Wishing she had never left at all
As a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away
From the heat and the action
Stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
Now I've changed and I want you to know
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
Wishing she had never left at all
I'll never left at all
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
I must have read the morning paper going into town
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
The day before you came
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
The day before you came
And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
Don't know how to take it
Don't know where to go
My resistance running low
And every day the hold is getting tighter
And it troubles me so
I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me
I don't have a strategy
It's just like taking candy from a baby
And I think I must be
Thinking nothing can stop him now
This is getting crazy
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what could happen
Where I'd be if I fell
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights are low
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
Leave them burning and then you're gone
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
No more carefree laughter
There is nothing we can do
In these old familiar rooms children would play
There is nothing we can do
There is nothing we can do
If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down
When the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best
If you put me to the test
As long as we're together
Get to know you better
You want me to leave it there
Afraid of a love affair
If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down
When the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best
If you put me to the test
Know I'm gonna get you
You don't wanna hurt me
I ain't gonna let you
You say that I waste my time
But I can't get you off my mind
If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down
When the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best
Gotta put me to the test
Gonna do my very best
Gotta put me to the test
Gonna do my very best
Gotta put me to the test
I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
Blue since the day we parted
I've been angry and sad about the things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
Blue since the day we parted
Blue since the day we parted
I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Super trouper beams are gonna blind me

Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
Part of a success that never ends
Still I'm thinking about you only
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
But it's gonna be all right
Everything will be so different when I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive

About the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small

If it makes you feel bad
So the winner takes it all
And the loser has to fall
To pay the bills I have to pay
And still there never seems to be
A single penny left for me
In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all
I'd fool around and have a ball
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
A man like that is hard to find
But I can't get him off my mind
And if he happens to be free
I bet he wouldn't fancy me
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game
My life will never be the same
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
Where are those happy days
They seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you
But you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love
It used to be so nice
It used to be so good
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
Though you are standing near
You made me feel alive
But something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
What happened to our love
It used to be so good
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you've broken a feather
I hope we can patch it up together
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Try once more like you did before
So the walls came tumbling down
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle
There is no way you can deny it
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Try once more like you did before
Try once more like you did before
I remember long ago another starry night like this
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
There was something in the air that night
They were shining there for you and me
Though I never thought that we could lose
If I had to do the same again
If I had to do the same again
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
There was something in the air that night
They were shining there for you and me
Though I never thought that we could lose
If I had to do the same again
There was something in the air that night
They were shining there for you and me
Though I never thought that we could loose
If I had to do the same again
A sense of expectation hanging in the air
Across the room your eyes are glowing in the dark
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
I know what you think
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
I open the window and I gaze into the night
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
So you're blue but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
If you think it's funny
Take it nice and slow
I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one
If you think it's funny
Take it nice and slow
If you think it's funny
If you think it's funny
If you think it's funny
All of those great romances
Robbing me of my rightful chances
And so I dealt you the blow
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
Wishing she had never left at all
As a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away
From the heat and the action
Stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
Now I've changed and I want you to know
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
Wishing she had never left at all
I'll never left at all
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
Only a week since we started
It seems to me for every time
I was an impossible case
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
What I'm trying to conceal
Now the lights are going out
And I'm never invited
I don't know what I'm talking to you
No wonder I get excited
And the way you see through me
But it means a lot to me
What I'm trying to conceal
Would you laugh at me
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
I wanna sing it out to everybody
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
So I say thank you for the music
The history book on the shelf is always repeating itself
I feel like I win when I lose
I feel like I win when I lose
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone
I love the feeling in the air
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Scattered driftwood on the beach
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Then I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
He took my heart and now I pay the price
You'll think you're in paradise
Then one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
I must have read the morning paper going into town
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
The day before you came
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
The day before you came
And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
They came flying from far away
Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell
They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
Over mountains and forests and seas
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
Over mountains and forests and seas
Make your choice but believe me
So love me or leave me
Make your choice but believe me
You think you're gonna make me softer with your fancy car
But I can tell you all your tricks ain't gonna get you far
They say that money's got a magic touch
You won't have me tonight
You can't buy me with your money
But I'll never be your girl
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
You didn't have to send me flowers like you did today
The girls might fall for everything you've got
You won't have me tonight
You can't buy me with your money
But I'll never be your girl
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
The way that you kiss goodnight
The way that you hold me tight
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing
I don't wanna see you cry
You better not get too high
You'll never get rid of me
There's no other place in this world
Where I rather would be
You better not get too high
There's no other place in this world
Where I rather would be
And now I know what they mean
You're a love machine
I was at a party and this fella said to me
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Over in the corner I could see this other guy
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar
And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
I said I was not exactly waiting for the bus
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Standing up is scary if you think you're gonna fall
I say if you ever want to know what's going on
The summer air was soft and warm
Did it's best to please us
Smiled like Mona Lisa
It was a fine and true romance
I can still recall our last summer
We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
But underneath we had a fear of flying
Like we were dancing our last dance
I can still recall our last summer
We could laugh and play
And now you're working in a bank
And your name is Harry
Yet you're the hero of my dreams
I can still recall our last summer
I can still recall our last summer
We could laugh and play
I was sitting by the phone
I was waiting all alone
It's a dark and dreary night
And I sit all alone impatiently
You were here and now you're gone
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking
Please forgive and then forget
And I sit all alone impatiently
This park and these houses
Old streets I have walked
My friends will get married
Have children and homes
Well planned and wise
Never expecting surprises
One chance in a lifetime
My friends and my family
This dull little town
Boys that I've kissed
Everything old and familiar
One chance in a lifetime
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter
And I can feel your love everywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
How I remember the first time we went to the movies
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter
And I can feel your love everywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
And I can feel your love everywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
Everything about you is right
Let it glow and let it be bright
I have a very good friend
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
You hear her voice everywhere
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
Exert that will of your own
Now we'd better hurry
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
You hear her voice everywhere
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
When I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed
When I kissed the teacher
All my friends at school
When I kissed the teacher
Couldn't quite believe his eyes
When I kissed the teacher
My whole class went wild
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
I was in a trance when I kissed the teacher
Suddenly I took the chance when I kissed the teacher
And I couldn't help it
I just had to kiss the teacher
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
Gonna show him I care
Gonna teach him you a lesson alright
When I kissed the teacher
All my sense had flown away
When I kissed the teacher
My whole class went wild
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher
When I kissed the teacher
When I kissed the teacher
When I kissed the teacher
When I kissed the teacher
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes
And you find me beautiful and irresistible
A giant creature that forever seems to grow in size
And you feel a strange attraction
The air is vibrant and electrified
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats
And a million voices blend into a single voice
People come and take their chances
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose a lot
Come make your own contribution to this melting pot
I'm the street you walk
The language you talk
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells and the turmoil
All the cars and the people
The air that you're breathing is me
People feed me with their lives I am a hungry soul
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light
Dazzled by the crazy magic
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf
And in the wind if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh
I'm the street you walk
The language you talk
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
All the cars and the people
The parks and the squares that you see
All the sounds that you hear
And the air that you're breathing is me
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
All the cars and the people
The air that you're breathing is me
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes
I'm the street you walk
The language you talk
Yes I am the city you let me be
And you find me beautiful and irresistible
A giant creature that forever seems to grow in size
The skyline is me and the energy
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats
I'm the street you walk
The language you talk
Yes I am the city you let me be
And a million voices blend into a single voice
The skyline is me and the energy
Down in the street they're all singing and shouting
Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone on your bed
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you
But then again you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us could
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
You're grieving deeply but still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it but you know your fate
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us could
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us could
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Don't know how to take it
Don't know where to go
My resistance running low
And every day the hold is getting tighter
And it troubles me so
I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me
I don't have a strategy
It's just like taking candy from a baby
And I think I must be
Thinking nothing can stop him now
This is getting crazy
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what could happen
Where I'd be if I fell
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Here's to us one more toast and then we'll pay the bill
Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done
In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done
It's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor
With nothing left untried
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done
You and I can share the silence
Finding comfort together
The way old friends do
And after fights and words of violence
We make up with each other
The way old friends do
Times of joy and times of sorrow
We will always see it through
Oh I don't care what comes tomorrow
We can face it together
The way old friends do
You and I can share the silence
Finding comfort together
The way old friends do
And after fights and words of violence
We make up with each other
The way old friends do
Times of joy and times of sorrow
We will always see it through
Oh I don't care what comes tomorrow
We can face it together
The way old friends do
We can face it together
The way old friends do
We can face it together
The way old friends do
We can face it together
The way old friends do
We can face it together
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
Man has always wanted a woman by his side to keep him company
Women always knew that it takes a man to get matrimonial harmony
Gotta have love to carry on living
Gotta have love till eternity
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
Flowers in the desert need a drop of rain like a woman needs her man
If a man's in love and his woman wants the moon
Then hell it down if he can
Somebody who loves you and somebody who cares
Gotta have love to carry on living
You can have peace if you understand
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
Day is dawning and I must go
You're asleep but still I'm sure you'll know
Why it had to end this way
You and I had a groovy time
But I told you somewhere down the line
You would have to find me gone
I just have to move along
Waiting in the morning rain
Lord give my restless soul a little patience
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
When you wake I know you'll cry
And the words I wrote to say goodbye
They won't comfort you at all
But in time you will understand
That the dreams we dreamed were made of sand
To live is to be free
Waiting in the morning rain
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
I was a fighter always looking for trouble
And my life was so empty
There was nothing left to live for
But then it happened one night
As I got into a fight
I could hear someone saying
You might need his help one day
We depend on one another
Love him that's the only way
On the road that we're going
We all need words of comfort and compassion
I was a woman never thinking of others
And my life was so lonely
Didn't care for anybody
But then I happened to meet
A begging man in the street
As I turned down his praying
You might need his help one day
We depend on one another
Love him that's the only way
On the road that we're going
We all need words of comfort and compassion
He leaves every morning
But if I would have to choose
I wouldn't let you go
Just give it some more time
And you will see our love will grow
We gotta have patience
Love isn't just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
Love is the reason for living
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
I've treated you like a queen
Just look at that cat
You'd think he was an angel
But if I would have to choose
I wouldn't let you go
Just give it some more time
And you will see our love will grow
We gotta have patience
Love isn't just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
Love is the reason for living
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
I was sitting by the phone
I was waiting all alone
It's a dark and dreary night
And I sit all alone impatiently
You were here and now you're gone
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking
Please forgive and then forget
And I sit all alone impatiently
The history book on the shelf is always repeating itself
I feel like I win when I lose
I feel like I win when I lose
Where is the spring and the summer
But still my love for you will live forever
We'll find a way to face a new tomorrow
I can't do without you
Where is the dream we were dreaming
And all the nights we shared
And I can't tell you just how much I miss you
We'll find a way to face a new tomorrow
I can't do without you
I can't do without you
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
The way that you kiss goodnight
The way that you hold me tight
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing
I don't wanna see you cry
You better not get too high
You'll never get rid of me
There's no other place in this world
Where I rather would be
You better not get too high
There's no other place in this world
Where I rather would be
And now I know what they mean
You're a love machine
Dance while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow
A thing to remember when we're all alone
Dance while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
God knows that we've been trying
So dance while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye
Yet it seems to make me sad
Dance while the music still goes on
Just like the night I met you
You know I won't forget you
So dance while the music still goes on
It's gonna be our last goodbye
Dance while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow
A thing to remember when we're all alone
So dance while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye
Dance while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
God knows that we've been trying
Dance while the music still goes on
Just like the night I met you
You think you're gonna make me softer with your fancy car
But I can tell you all your tricks ain't gonna get you far
They say that money's got a magic touch
You won't have me tonight
You can't buy me with your money
But I'll never be your girl
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
You didn't have to send me flowers like you did today
The girls might fall for everything you've got
You won't have me tonight
You can't buy me with your money
But I'll never be your girl
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
I thought I would no more
Manage to hit the ceiling
You brought it back to me
You make me think that you
Possibly could release me
I think you'll be able to
Make all my dreams come true
You're something I'd been pleading for
I lay my life before you
I'll have you want me more and more
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I've been waiting for you
You're gonna feel so fine
You'll never want to leave me
I feel you belong to me
Someday you will agree
You're something I'd been pleading for
I lay my life before you
I'll have you want me more and more
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I've been waiting for you
Make your choice but believe me
So love me or leave me
Make your choice but believe me
Where are those happy days
They seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you
But you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love
It used to be so nice
It used to be so good
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
Though you are standing near
You made me feel alive
But something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
What happened to our love
It used to be so good
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
Blue since the day we parted
I've been angry and sad about the things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
Blue since the day we parted
Blue since the day we parted
I remember long ago another starry night like this
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
There was something in the air that night
They were shining there for you and me
Though I never thought that we could lose
If I had to do the same again
If I had to do the same again
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
There was something in the air that night
They were shining there for you and me
Though I never thought that we could lose
If I had to do the same again
There was something in the air that night
They were shining there for you and me
Though I never thought that we could loose
If I had to do the same again
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights are low
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
Leave them burning and then you're gone
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
Are you sure you wanna hear more
What if I ain't worth the while
Not the style you'd be looking for
Things look different in the morning light
I'm jealous and I'm proud
If you hurt my feelings I'll cry out loud
Are you sure you wanna hear more
Would I be the one you seek
Mild and meek like the girl next door
I may be an angel in disguise
It's lonely to be free
Sweet nothings in my ear
But I do believe in sympathy
Are you sure you wanna hear more
Won't you have a drink with me
Just to see you're not really sore
I'm just not the girl to hide my face
There's a special love
Like an eagle flying with a dove
I'll find it in the end
When I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed
When I kissed the teacher
All my friends at school
When I kissed the teacher
Couldn't quite believe his eyes
When I kissed the teacher
My whole class went wild
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
I was in a trance when I kissed the teacher
Suddenly I took the chance when I kissed the teacher
And I couldn't help it
I just had to kiss the teacher
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
Gonna show him I care
Gonna teach him you a lesson alright
When I kissed the teacher
All my sense had flown away
When I kissed the teacher
My whole class went wild
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher
When I kissed the teacher
When I kissed the teacher
When I kissed the teacher
When I kissed the teacher
To pay the bills I have to pay
And still there never seems to be
A single penny left for me
In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all
I'd fool around and have a ball
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
A man like that is hard to find
But I can't get him off my mind
And if he happens to be free
I bet he wouldn't fancy me
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game
My life will never be the same
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
I was out for the morning sun
Couldn't sleep so I thought I'd take a walk
I was thinking of you and me
I could hardly believe my eyes
When I saw this guy closing your front door
Had a feeling of emptiness
Like I've never had before
As he disappeared in his car
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do
Everything I had ever been
Everything in my life's a part of you
And I just couldn't move my feet
So I stood on the pavement as you came out
You acted as you didn't know
What it was all about
Baby how could you do it
You just told me lies
Baby how could you tell me
I was stupid to believe you
I was blind but now I see
Then you smiled and you took my hand
And one of them is my brother Joe.
He's been gone for a long long time
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay.
You'll be seeing a lot of him
I've seen it on your face
So now we'll go separate ways
Like an image passing by
In the mirror of your eyes
I can see it all so clearly
Like reflections of your mind
Are the words you try to find
But I know I don't possess you
You are still my love and my life
Still my one and only
I've watched you look away
Sitting here close to you
Knowing that maybe tonight we're through
Like an image passing by
In the mirror of your eyes
I can see it all so clearly
Like reflections of your mind
Are the words you try to find
But I know I don't possess you
You are still my love and my life
No more carefree laughter
There is nothing we can do
In these old familiar rooms children would play
There is nothing we can do
There is nothing we can do
Early this morning I drove in the rain
Out to the airport to get on the plane
After all I've had to go through
Guess I've been working a little too hard
In a few hours the plane will descend
I can imagine the beach and the sand
Walking with someone and holding his hand
After all I've had to go through
I've got a feeling the dream will come true
Somebody's waiting and I'll forget you
Only a week since we started
It seems to me for every time
I was an impossible case
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
What I'm trying to conceal
Now the lights are going out
And I'm never invited
I don't know what I'm talking to you
No wonder I get excited
And the way you see through me
But it means a lot to me
What I'm trying to conceal
Would you laugh at me
Old streets I have walked
Have children and homes
Never expecting surprises
But who the the hell am I
One chance in a lifetime
This dull little town
Boys that I've kissed
Everything old and familiar
But who the the hell am I
One chance in a lifetime
Yes I will take it...
They came flying from far away
Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell
They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
Over mountains and forests and seas
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
Over mountains and forests and seas
If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down
When the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best
If you put me to the test
As long as we're together
Get to know you better
You want me to leave it there
Afraid of a love affair
If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down
When the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best
If you put me to the test
Know I'm gonna get you
You don't wanna hurt me
I ain't gonna let you
You say that I waste my time
But I can't get you off my mind
If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down
When the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best
Gotta put me to the test
Gonna do my very best
Gotta put me to the test
Gonna do my very best
Gotta put me to the test
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
I wanna sing it out to everybody
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
So I say thank you for the music
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone
I love the feeling in the air
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Scattered driftwood on the beach
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you've broken a feather
I hope we can patch it up together
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Try once more like you did before
So the walls came tumbling down
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle
There is no way you can deny it
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Try once more like you did before
Try once more like you did before
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter
And I can feel your love everywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
How I remember the first time we went to the movies
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter
And I can feel your love everywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
And I can feel your love everywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
Everything about you is right
Let it glow and let it be bright
So you're blue but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
If you think it's funny
Take it nice and slow
I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one
If you think it's funny
Take it nice and slow
If you think it's funny
If you think it's funny
If you think it's funny
A sense of expectation hanging in the air
Across the room your eyes are glowing in the dark
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
I know what you think
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Then I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
He took my heart and now I pay the price
You'll think you're in paradise
Then one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
I open the window and I gaze into the night
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
Something good in everything I see
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness still another mile
Something good in everything I see
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I'll cross the stream
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
Something good in everything I see
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I'll cross the stream
About the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Thinking I'd be strong there
The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
But tell me does she kiss
Does it feel the same
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all
If it makes you feel sad
You've come to shake my hand
If it makes you feel bad
So the winner takes it all
And the loser has to fall
It's a dead end street
They tie your hands and tie your feet
And the street is narrow
You know they're gonna get you
You try to break away
But they will never let you
It's a dead end street
They tie your hands and tie your feet
And the street is narrow
You're like a goldfish in a bowl
It really doesn't matter
You've done it all before
By now they know the pattern
It's a dead end street
They tie your hands and tie your feet
And the street is narrow
You're like a goldfish in a bowl
You know they're gonna get you
You know they'll never let you
It's a dead end street
They tie your hands and tie your feet
And the street is narrow
You're like a goldfish in a bowl
They'll take your soul
You know they're gonna get you
Super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
Suddenly I feel all right
And it's gonna be so different when I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
Part of a success that never ends
Still I'm thinking about you only
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
But it's gonna be all right
Everything will be so different when I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms and hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
Super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
I was at a party and this fella said to me
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Over in the corner I could see this other guy
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar
And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
I said I was not exactly waiting for the bus
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Standing up is scary if you think you're gonna fall
I say if you ever want to know what's going on
The summer air was soft and warm
Did it's best to please us
Smiled like Mona Lisa
It was a fine and true romance
I can still recall our last summer
We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
But underneath we had a fear of flying
Like we were dancing our last dance
I can still recall our last summer
We could laugh and play
And now you're working in a bank
And your name is Harry
Yet you're the hero of my dreams
I can still recall our last summer
I can still recall our last summer
We could laugh and play
You and I can share the silence
Finding comfort together
The way old friends do
And after fights and words of violence
We make up with each other
The way old friends do
Times of joy and times of sorrow
We will always see it through
Oh I don't care what comes tomorrow
We can face it together
The way old friends do
You and I can share the silence
Finding comfort together
The way old friends do
And after fights and words of violence
We make up with each other
The way old friends do
Times of joy and times of sorrow
We will always see it through
Oh I don't care what comes tomorrow
We can face it together
The way old friends do
We can face it together
The way old friends do
We can face it together
The way old friends do
We can face it together
The way old friends do
We can face it together
I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence
Among the things I love so dearly
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
And I'm close to fainting
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
And I'm close to fainting
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
And I'm close to fainting
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
And I'm close to fainting
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
All of those great romances
Robbing me of my rightful chances
And so I dealt you the blow
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
Wishing she had never left at all
As a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away
From the heat and the action
Stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
Now I've changed and I want you to know
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
Wishing she had never left at all
I'll never left at all
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
He stands towering over me
Tells me I must take him seriously
Droning on the usual way
He's such a clever guy
Then I wonder should I laugh or cry
In the striped pajamas that I bought
Of his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does
And me I get so tired
And I wonder should I laugh or cry
High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes
In the warm and safe cocoon
So should I laugh or cry
Dangerously indifferent I have grown
Pain where there was pain before
Far away he rambles on
I feel my throat go dry
Then I wonder should I laugh or cry
High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes
In the warm and safe cocoon
I have a very good friend
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
You hear her voice everywhere
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
Exert that will of your own
Now we'd better hurry
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
You hear her voice everywhere
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
Here's to us one more toast and then we'll pay the bill
Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done
In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done
It's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor
With nothing left untried
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done
Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace
Dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
Like an angel passing through my room
Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined
Playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
Like an angel passing through my room
And my twilight images go by
I must have read the morning paper going into town
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
The day before you came
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
The day before you came
And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
Down in the street they're all singing and shouting
Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone on your bed
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you
But then again you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us could
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
You're grieving deeply but still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it but you know your fate
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us could
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us could
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Don't know how to take it
Don't know where to go
My resistance running low
And every day the hold is getting tighter
And it troubles me so
I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me
I don't have a strategy
It's just like taking candy from a baby
And I think I must be
Thinking nothing can stop him now
This is getting crazy
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what could happen
Where I'd be if I fell
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Put on your white sombrero
Saddle your horse my dear
And ride off into the sunset
For there is no place for you here
Like and old fashioned hero
You think our life is a movie
I live and feel and I can do without you
Put on your white sombrero
Think of this day as a showdown
This is the end for me and you
Now be a bold vaquero
Don't show your feelings
I'll cry while you're disappearing
All dressed in white unchained and free without me
Put on your white sombrero
Like all the cowboys do
Who'll never speak harshly to you
You're such a caballero
I want someone who will take me
I need a man who is in rhyme
I need a man who is in rhyme
We're not the stars of a Hollywood movie
So what's the use to pretend
I'm not so charming and you're not so groovy
You've gotta face it my friend
You've been living in a dream world
You just can't escape from reality
Doesn't mean they're in a dream world
And you say to me how I love you girl
It's a real dream world
You had your hopes and your high expectations
Somehow it doesn't seem right
I'm getting fed up with your accusations
I'm not your angel in white
You've been living in a dream world
You just can't escape from reality
Doesn't mean they're in a dream world
And you say to me how I love you girl
It's a real dream world
You've been living in a dream world
You just can't escape from reality
Doesn't mean they're in a dream world
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
I wanna sing it out to everybody
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
So I say thank you for the music
I have tried in vain never had success
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost my only friend
Now it seems I have to start again
I wish that I knew it
Wish I had found somebody to care for
Life is so lonely if life is just only
Looking for someone who would want to stay
I might find her with a bit of luck one day
But who knows so until then
I can only try and try again
I wish that I knew it
Wish I had found somebody to care for
Life is so lonely if life is just only
I wish that I knew it
Wish I had found somebody to care for
Life is so lonely if life is just only
I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
How I wish this road would take me home where I belong
I'm tired and all my dreams have failed along the way
I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
Though I wonder what my folks would think about me now
Santa Rosa I'll be back to stay...
Santa Rosa I'll be back to stay
I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
How I wish to see the old house where I used to live
How I regret the day when I set out to roam
Santa Rosa I'll be back to stay...
Santa Rosa I'll be back to stay
I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
And it means something special to me
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me
How lucky can one fellow be
Who could ever believe that she would be mine
And when we go for a walk in the park
Then she holds me and squeezes my hand
About all the things that we plan
Who could ever believe that she would be mine
Who could ever believe that she would be mine
And if she ever leaves me what could I do
I said me and my buddy gonna pick a bale of cotton
Now me and my buddy gonna pick a bale a day
I said me and my buddy gonna pick a bale of cotton
Now me and my buddy gonna pick a bale a day
All covered with snow
Is worse than a thief
All covered with snow
Hear the ding dong ring
You go marching to the table
See the same old thing
See the fork on the table
If you say a thing about it
You're in trouble with the man
Let the midnight special
Let the midnight special
If you ever go to Houston
Well you'd better act right
And you'd better not gamble
And you'd better not fight
For the sheriff will arrest you
And he'll take you down
And before you understand it
Let the midnight special shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Let the midnight special shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
And I have to sit down for a while
The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl
Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Then when she's gone there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny
What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go
And why I just don't know
Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers...
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Schoolbag in hand she leaves home in the early morning
Sometimes when I'm mad
There's a part of me that seems to be a little sad
Sometimes when I scream
Part of me is acting while the other stands beside
We're like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes were a hit together
Gloomy moods and inspiration
Were a funny combination
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute
And you'll find the answer in it
Sometimes I have toyed
With ideas that I got from good old Dr. Freud
Nothing new of course
It may seem to you I try to break through open doors
I just wanna say a lot of that applies to me
We're like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes were a hit together
Gloomy moods and inspiration
Were a funny combination
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute
And you'll find the answer in it
We're like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes were a hit together
Gloomy moods and inspiration
Were a funny combination
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute
And you'll find the answer in it
We're like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes were a hit together
Gloomy moods and inspiration
Were a funny combination
In a rich man's world
And I can't get enough of it
So don't stop doing it
Just a feeling that you're watching me
That you'll be walking up to me in a while
Then we'll be dancing through the night
Knowing everything from there on must be right
But somehow I know I'm not wrong
There's nothing we can do
And tonight is very special
It's the night for me and you
To make such a lot of money
Today a new jet plane
Tonight it's a new hotel
You live in your own world
You're under a magic spell
And I've always been under your heel
Holy Christ what a lousy deal
Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways
And I ain't gonna take it no more
Once again I wanna look into the eye
Girl I'm leaving and I'm burying the past
No one here will make a sucker out of me
Some people long for Berlin and Barcelona
And I know some who prefer Arizona
There's only me who is dying to see ...
When the autumn leaves are falling to the ground
When the air gets cold
And it almost makes me cry
So sad and kind of bitter sweet
And the memories filled with tears
And I fear my heart will break
Guess it all was my mistake
Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees
And rain fell softly on your face
Oh I remember every little thing about that day
I remember every place
And rain fell softly on your face
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days
For next bus traveling
The beautiful weather
If I could have my way
I know what I'd like to be
Take a sip from every flower
While away each lazy hour
Like an old railroad bum by the track
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw
I wish there was a way that I could show you
How your songs set me free
I guess I'll never get a chance to know you
Still you're close as can be
Make the bandstand to a dreamland Rubber Ball Man
Clapping your hands let your feet dance Rubber Ball Man
Look at your fans how we love you Rubber Ball Man
Look at your fans how we love you Rubber Ball Man
Look at your fans how we love you Rubber Ball Man
I'm sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you
It chills me to the bone
I never thought you'd leave me
But now I know it's true
I'm sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you
It chills me to the bone
I never thought you'd leave me
But now I know it's true
Little memories of things we used to do
He walked into my house as smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
He found a temporary home in my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone
As though he'd only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned
He walked into my house as smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
As though he'd only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned
There's a gentleness to everything you do
When you call me on the phone
And I'm feeling so alone
When you ask me to come over baby
I could never stay on my own
I've never done that before
I've never done that before
I've never done that before
I've never done that before
Now there's a shadow falling over our faces
Doubt forever in our hearts
And in a while we'll stop to pick up the traces
We won't find the missing parts
Buy me a ticket I'll go to the Bahamas
I need a rest from our petty little dramas
Look what you've done
I'm missing all the fun
A chance to feel the sun
I wasn't ready for this kind of intrusion
I was taken by surprise
Now both of us are in a state of confusion
Hesitation in our eyes
Something unwanted has entered our existence
I think it's better to view it from a distance
Look what you've done
I'm missing all the fun
A chance to feel the sun
Look what you've done
I'm missing all the fun
A chance to feel the sun
Look what you've done
I'm missing all the fun
A chance to feel the sun
Look what you've done
I'm missing all the fun
A chance to feel the sun
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
Man has always wanted a woman by his side to keep him company
Women always knew that it takes a man to get matrimonial harmony
Gotta have love to carry on living
Gotta have love till eternity
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
Flowers in the desert need a drop of rain like a woman needs her man
If a man's in love and his woman wants the moon
Then hell it down if he can
Somebody who loves you and somebody who cares
Gotta have love to carry on living
You can have peace if you understand
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
I was sitting by the phone
I was waiting all alone
It's a dark and dreary night
And I sit all alone impatiently
You were here and now you're gone
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking
Please forgive and then forget
And I sit all alone impatiently
The history book on the shelf is always repeating itself
I feel like I win when I lose
I feel like I win when I lose
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
The way that you kiss goodnight
The way that you hold me tight
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing
I don't wanna see you cry
You better not get too high
You'll never get rid of me
There's no other place in this world
Where I rather would be
You better not get too high
There's no other place in this world
Where I rather would be
And now I know what they mean
You're a love machine
You think you're gonna make me softer with your fancy car
But I can tell you all your tricks ain't gonna get you far
They say that money's got a magic touch
You won't have me tonight
You can't buy me with your money
But I'll never be your girl
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
You didn't have to send me flowers like you did today
The girls might fall for everything you've got
You won't have me tonight
You can't buy me with your money
But I'll never be your girl
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
Make your choice but believe me
So love me or leave me
Make your choice but believe me
Where are those happy days
They seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you
But you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love
It used to be so nice
It used to be so good
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
Though you are standing near
You made me feel alive
But something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
What happened to our love
It used to be so good
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
Blue since the day we parted
I've been angry and sad about the things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
Blue since the day we parted
Blue since the day we parted
I remember long ago another starry night like this
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
There was something in the air that night
They were shining there for you and me
Though I never thought that we could lose
If I had to do the same again
If I had to do the same again
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
There was something in the air that night
They were shining there for you and me
Though I never thought that we could lose
If I had to do the same again
There was something in the air that night
They were shining there for you and me
Though I never thought that we could loose
If I had to do the same again
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights are low
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
Leave them burning and then you're gone
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
To pay the bills I have to pay
And still there never seems to be
A single penny left for me
In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all
I'd fool around and have a ball
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
A man like that is hard to find
But I can't get him off my mind
And if he happens to be free
I bet he wouldn't fancy me
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game
My life will never be the same
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
No more carefree laughter
There is nothing we can do
In these old familiar rooms children would play
There is nothing we can do
There is nothing we can do
Only a week since we started
It seems to me for every time
I was an impossible case
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
What I'm trying to conceal
Now the lights are going out
And I'm never invited
I don't know what I'm talking to you
No wonder I get excited
And the way you see through me
But it means a lot to me
What I'm trying to conceal
Would you laugh at me
If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down
When the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best
If you put me to the test
As long as we're together
Get to know you better
You want me to leave it there
Afraid of a love affair
If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down
When the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best
If you put me to the test
Know I'm gonna get you
You don't wanna hurt me
I ain't gonna let you
You say that I waste my time
But I can't get you off my mind
If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down
When the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best
Gotta put me to the test
Gonna do my very best
Gotta put me to the test
Gonna do my very best
Gotta put me to the test
They came flying from far away
Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell
They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
Over mountains and forests and seas
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
Over mountains and forests and seas
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
I wanna sing it out to everybody
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
So I say thank you for the music
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone
I love the feeling in the air
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Scattered driftwood on the beach
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
Waiting for the sunrise
Walking in the moonlight
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you've broken a feather
I hope we can patch it up together
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Try once more like you did before
So the walls came tumbling down
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle
There is no way you can deny it
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Try once more like you did before
Try once more like you did before
So you're blue but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
If you think it's funny
Take it nice and slow
I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one
If you think it's funny
Take it nice and slow
If you think it's funny
If you think it's funny
If you think it's funny
A sense of expectation hanging in the air
Across the room your eyes are glowing in the dark
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
I know what you think
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
I open the window and I gaze into the night
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
Something good in everything I see
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness still another mile
Something good in everything I see
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I'll cross the stream
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
Something good in everything I see
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I'll cross the stream
About the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Thinking I'd be strong there
The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
But tell me does she kiss
Does it feel the same
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all
If it makes you feel sad
You've come to shake my hand
If it makes you feel bad
So the winner takes it all
And the loser has to fall
Super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
Suddenly I feel all right
And it's gonna be so different when I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
Part of a success that never ends
Still I'm thinking about you only
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
But it's gonna be all right
Everything will be so different when I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms and hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
Super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
All of those great romances
Robbing me of my rightful chances
And so I dealt you the blow
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
Wishing she had never left at all
As a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away
From the heat and the action
Stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
Now I've changed and I want you to know
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
Wishing she had never left at all
I'll never left at all
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
I have a very good friend
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
You hear her voice everywhere
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
Exert that will of your own
Now we'd better hurry
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
You hear her voice everywhere
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
I must have read the morning paper going into town
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
The day before you came
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
The day before you came
And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
Don't know how to take it
Don't know where to go
My resistance running low
And every day the hold is getting tighter
And it troubles me so
I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me
I don't have a strategy
It's just like taking candy from a baby
And I think I must be
Thinking nothing can stop him now
This is getting crazy
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what could happen
Where I'd be if I fell
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Thinking nothing can stop him now
And the fireworks are through
Feeling lost and feeling blue
It's the end of the party
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
And he thinks he'll be okay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend
That the dreams we had before
Than confetti on the floor
It's the end of a decade
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
Man has always wanted a woman by his side to keep him company
Women always knew that it takes a man to get matrimonial harmony
Gotta have love to carry on living
Gotta have love till eternity
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
Flowers in the desert need a drop of rain like a woman needs her man
If a man's in love and his woman wants the moon
Then hell it down if he can
Somebody who loves you and somebody who cares
Gotta have love to carry on living
You can have peace if you understand
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand
I was a fighter always looking for trouble
And my life was so empty
There was nothing left to live for
But then it happened one night
As I got into a fight
I could hear someone saying
You might need his help one day
We depend on one another
Love him that's the only way
On the road that we're going
We all need words of comfort and compassion
I was a woman never thinking of others
And my life was so lonely
Didn't care for anybody
But then I happened to meet
A begging man in the street
As I turned down his praying
You might need his help one day
We depend on one another
Love him that's the only way
On the road that we're going
We all need words of comfort and compassion
I was sitting by the phone
I was waiting all alone
It's a dark and dreary night
And I sit all alone impatiently
You were here and now you're gone
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking
Please forgive and then forget
And I sit all alone impatiently
He leaves every morning
But if I would have to choose
I wouldn't let you go
Just give it some more time
And you will see our love will grow
We gotta have patience
Love isn't just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
Love is the reason for living
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
I've treated you like a queen
Just look at that cat
You'd think he was an angel
But if I would have to choose
I wouldn't let you go
Just give it some more time
And you will see our love will grow
We gotta have patience
Love isn't just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
Love is the reason for living
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
The history book on the shelf is always repeating itself
I feel like I win when I lose
I feel like I win when I lose
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
The way that you kiss goodnight
The way that you hold me tight
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing
I don't wanna see you cry
You better not get too high
You'll never get rid of me
There's no other place in this world
Where I rather would be
You better not get too high
There's no other place in this world
Where I rather would be
And now I know what they mean
You're a love machine
You think you're gonna make me softer with your fancy car
But I can tell you all your tricks ain't gonna get you far
They say that money's got a magic touch
You won't have me tonight
You can't buy me with your money
But I'll never be your girl
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
You didn't have to send me flowers like you did today
The girls might fall for everything you've got
You won't have me tonight
You can't buy me with your money
But I'll never be your girl
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
You can't buy me with your money
You know it's not worth trying
Make your choice but believe me
So love me or leave me
Make your choice but believe me
Where are those happy days
They seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you
But you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love
It used to be so nice
It used to be so good
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
Though you are standing near
You made me feel alive
But something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
What happened to our love
It used to be so good
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on
When you're gone how can I even try to go on
I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
Blue since the day we parted
I've been angry and sad about the things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
Blue since the day we parted
Blue since the day we parted
I remember long ago another starry night like this
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
There was something in the air that night
They were shining there for you and me
Though I never thought that we could lose
If I had to do the same again
If I had to do the same again
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
There was something in the air that night
They were shining there for you and me
Though I never thought that we could lose
If I had to do the same again
There was something in the air that night
They were shining there for you and me
Though I never thought that we could loose
If I had to do the same again
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights are low
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
Leave them burning and then you're gone
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
To pay the bills I have to pay
And still there never seems to be
A single penny left for me
In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all
I'd fool around and have a ball
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
A man like that is hard to find
But I can't get him off my mind
And if he happens to be free
I bet he wouldn't fancy me
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game
My life will never be the same
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
In the rich man's world
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

When the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best
If you put me to the test
As long as we're together
Get to know you better
You want me to leave it there

Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Then I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
He took my heart and now I pay the price
You'll think you're in paradise
Then one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
I open the window and I gaze into the night
There's not a soul out there

Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

I'll cross the stream
About the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Thinking I'd be strong there
The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
But tell me does she kiss
Does it feel the same
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all
If it makes you feel sad
You've come to shake my hand
If it makes you feel bad
So the winner takes it all
And the loser has to fall
Super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
Suddenly I feel all right
And it's gonna be so different when I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
Part of a success that never ends
Still I'm thinking about you only
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
But it's gonna be all right
Everything will be so different when I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms and hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight
Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
Super trouper lights are gonna find me
Feeling like and I'm the one
Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
I was at a party and this fella said to me
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Over in the corner I could see this other guy
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar
And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
I said I was not exactly waiting for the bus
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Till the night is gone
Standing up is scary if you think you're gonna fall
I say if you ever want to know what's going on
I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
All of those great romances
Robbing me of my rightful chances
And so I dealt you the blow
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
Wishing she had never left at all
As a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away
From the heat and the action
Stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
Now I've changed and I want you to know
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
Wishing she had never left at all
I'll never left at all
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
Here's to us one more toast and then we'll pay the bill
Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done
In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done
It's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor
With nothing left untried
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done
I have a very good friend
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
You hear her voice everywhere
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
Exert that will of your own
Now we'd better hurry
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
You hear her voice everywhere
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence
Among the things I love so dearly
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
And I'm close to fainting
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
And I'm close to fainting
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
And I'm close to fainting
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
And I'm close to fainting
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
I must have read the morning paper going into town
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
The day before you came
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
The day before you came
And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
Don't know how to take it
Don't know where to go
My resistance running low
And every day the hold is getting tighter
And it troubles me so
I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me
I don't have a strategy
It's just like taking candy from a baby
And I think I must be
Thinking nothing can stop him now
This is getting crazy
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what could happen
Where I'd be if I fell
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Thinking nothing can stop him now
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
I wanna sing it out to everybody
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
So I say thank you for the music
I know just how to whisper
And I know just how to cry
I know just where to find the answers
And I know just how to lie
I know just how to fake it
And I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth
And then I know just when to dream
And I know just where to touch you
And I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer
And I know when to let you loose
And I know the night is fading
And I know that time's gonna fly
And I'm never gonna tell you everything
But I know I've got to give it a try
And I know the roads to riches
And I know the ways to fame
And I always know the name of the game
But I don't know how to leave you
And I'll never let you fall
And I don't know how you do it
Every time I see you all the rays of the sun
Are streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim
At your eyes like a spotlight
And it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
And turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright
I can make the runner stumble
I can make the final block
I can make all the stadiums rock
I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone
But I'm never gonna make it without you
And I'm never gonna make it like you do
A sense of expectation
We've done it all before
I know what you think
So I'll offer her a drink
I see you leave your table
I'm really glad you came
We've done it all before
We've done it all before
Every good man needs a helping hand
So I travel alone if I can
Every man has a guiding star
And he knows what he's gonna get
When he's going too far
Living on the dark side once again
It's sad to lose a friend
Looking at things with empty feelings
For Every good man needs a helping hand
I should have known too
Every good man needs a helping hand
Every good man needs a helping hand
So I travel alone if I can
Every man has a guiding star
When he's going too far
Living on the dark side once again
It's sad to lose a friend
Looking at things with empty feelings
For Every good man needs a helping hand
I should have known too
Every good man needs a helping hand
The roundabout is just beginning
Your happiness is waiting for you
I feel so dizzy I wanna go
Now I don't think I can take much more
I want the speed that I had before
I'm feeling sick and I wanna stop
I got a feeling I reached the top
I only wanted to dance and sing
The roundabout is just beginning
Your happiness is waiting for you
I feel so dizzy I wanna go
Now I don't think I can take much more
I want the speed that I had before
I'm feeling sick and I wanna stop
I got a feeling I reached the top
I only wanted to dance and sing
Your happiness is waiting for you
I'm feeling sick and I wanna stop
I got a feeling I reached the top
I was a loser then but I'm a winner now
How everything in life comes down to this
I'm still alive my life is rolling on
I'm still alive the agony is gone
I cried a sea of tears
How I could stand the fear
I think of all the nights I lay alone and scared
I'm still alive My life is rolling on
I'm still alive the agony is gone
Suddenly detouring so unexpectedly
With uncompromising forces
My strongholds broke down all too easily
I remember well how it did embarrass me
I hung on to his every smile
Marveled at his style
He walked into my house as smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
He found a temporary home in my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone
As though he only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned
And once again the river's flowing slowly
Following its safe and uneventful course
Now the tears have dried
It's become a pleasant break
I recall without remorse
But now and then I wonder where he is
And I will admit he had something that I miss
I guess he was a rolling stone
The only one I've known
He walked into my house as smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
He found a temporary home in my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone
As though he only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned
He walked into my house as smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
As though he only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Walk into the light of the sunbeam
There's an M in the end of the tunnel
Her hands wide open her eyes are in love
So much time these hands and these eyes
Now step into a yet well known place
There's an S in the end of the bedroom
Stressed and jealous but as time goes by
The S is somehow a part of your heart
They sometimes switch
Or haven't they before
Now a lot of years have passed
Other letters enter your life
Or an S would be good instead
Remember no more tunnels
And a bright F is also there
A bright F is always there
Cause to the world I love
For just one hug will make it ease
To everything there is a time
In the winter there is snow
But I'll calm you yes I'll do
All the days that seem to come
But the autumn brings the calmness
So I love you most of all
Please believe me please don't cry
All these things you've never tasted
All these years that seem so wasted
Never were and never will be
And the time has come
I'll give you my hand
So won't you tell me a lie
Won't you scream or cry
In the way that you've always
Always so won't you be here with me
And there's no where I can go
Words all through the night
So won't you tell me a lie
Won't you scream or cry
I got your letter and a job today
To everything there is an end
Look straight in my eyes
And wind is the son of dust
You've never reached this thin red line
Never fairly told this lie
I'm no more all boarders thrown
It seems like it's untrue but in a certain day they came
Kid was long past gone
And tears replace the scars
The world will clean its wounds
And nothing less I hope
And the panic of spring runs all through me
And the cup of tea spilled over me
But you'll never know
How much you really mean to me
You see I only want an unfulfilled love
To keep the spirit of spring
Or I'd better make a confession to you
But you know in such things
Is a better day than today to act
Welcome the painful days
Welcome the lovely days
You're a part of them so I love you
Which feeling grows inside my heart
And a perfect glowing sun still shines inside
Many miles you're far away
Could this passion lead the way
Lead you safely in my arms
Been through fire and kiss and glass
All this time seems like a blink
Something spoken something missed
Could forever be the truth
Or just never in advance
My desire and your green eyes
Fit to me like summer skies
Come together in the end
Never gone never forget
When will you see the falling leaves
Secrets in love and secrets to share
Secrets to keep and secrets to bare
And oh my love give me a secret
Give me your trusting
Give me your brightness
And oh my love give me a kiss
I'll keep dancing with you
And you'll keep dancing with me
And the sky will be blue
And the rain will still sing
Standing there at the door
A friendly face of a ghost
Standing there at the door
Nothing seems on the floor
I'll drink with you as the light
And the dark will be there
And we'll also be there
Standing there at the door
The trembling hands of a fragrance
With clouds and a strange bit sorrow
But I'll see you yes I'll see you
In red you'll borrow all of my sorrow
So I thank you but when tomorrow
I'm leaving you today
When leaves fall down yellow and brown
I'm leaving you tonight
In long long dreams in crying eyes
In blue skies we'll go
The grief is here to stay
There must be life after life
And Death after death
Like there's day after day
And Night after night
When all the world seems far away
And just the two of us are left
I'll sing to you these words all through
The night we'll fly in peace and I'll
And I'll be air the air that makes me
Wanna dive into your skin
Into your skin into the stars
Into your breath and by your eyes
Into your breath and by your eyes
Your pretty eyes I am divided
Into fire and glass tonight
And when I whisper when I dance
And when I fall into your arms
It's not a kid it's not a man
It's just myself electric shock
Is due to glances and to touches
Underneath what seems to be
What seems to hold what seems to touch
What seems to breathe in a moment
And all these moments all the thrill
And all the light that you have brought
Oh God please make this moment last
Into your breath and by your eyes
That you have showed me is my light
That contain so many needs
And silence is the sweetest thing on earth
And we are birds that fly away
And in our hugs I cannot say
Your hand from my hand or your breath
From my breath let me be unsure
And ever I'm confused a sweet kiss
And a hug will make us birds
Will give the world away
It's just ourselves that's left I'll be desire
You'll be the passion we'll be two stars
In a spring more open sky
Bring what you have as to survive
Bring what you need bring what you are
Bring and your silence
Bring and your memories
Bring and your dreams
Don't bring anything at all
Come and bring just you
What you are and where we are
I'm so bored and so confused
Don't bring anything at all
Could this please be the last time
Could this time be just for me
Make me ready for my show
See the star see the star now
Clap your hands clap your hands now
On the rope up high here
All these years such silence
Where's my home where are my sons
All my life a funny wig
See the star see the star now
Hail the clown hail the clown now
And wanted by the moon
There's plenty of warmth on sun
It's more than you can stand
More than you can stand
And moon is hardly known
As most of us I think
They say it's cold and lacking air
But we can't see it all
Sing with me and dance with me
The moon seems far and on the sun
I cannot put my dreams
Wanted by the light and wanted by the dark
Light gives life and gives support
And both of them give questions
Sing with me and dance with me
The moon seems far and on the sun
I cannot put my dreams
And I wish the four of them
Since I've seen you laugh
It's always just a smile
Where your shadow lives
When it feels your grief
That describe the end
Or what it was before
Where all shadows live
A place where you and I will someday meet
Will not cease to exist
And light will prevail
Witches and fairies keep it safe
They take it to a coast
Love got dressed like dance
And blew life to my body
I'll get down on my knees
And ask for your fingers
So take me home take me into your arms
Let me see your world
It's in the back of my head
In a picture that's fading
The seas and all the stars
Show them how you smile
I'll put my head on your head
And I'll be dancing around you
Like I have never ever cried
Like I have never ever walked
So take me home take me into your arms
Let me see your world
It's in the back of my head
In a picture that's fading
The seas and all the stars
Show them how you dance
I'll put my head on your head
Raise your eyes very slowly dear
The sunlight may make you blind
Seal the hunted story of our lives
Make it a book and set on fire
We made so huge and strong the wall
And called us heroes of the world
I know the place where flowers grow
Where all the trains are starting from
Don't fall asleep before I lull
Don't fall asleep before I do
I will make my life a song and I'll
Amuse ourselves until we die
This will be the place that every time
Sometimes hearts can be broken
Sometimes you're feeling so empty
But something you can't see
Brings you back to life
Trying to make you feel secure
Releasing my heart's thoughts
I'm trying hard to make you see
You're all I can feel
You're all that is real
Sometimes there's no sunshine
There's no real fight
If you wanna see me fall
But I'll never be down
The days are heavy the hours a lot to bear
In Europe there's fresh air
Or is it long past gone
For the air is something everybody needs
But no one ever cared
The war has started two thousand years ago
And Jesus still gets nailed
To the cross that everyone builds
This cross is the field of your sickness
I want so much to cry
And then turn around and hide
Please try and feel some pride
Show me that you don't know how
To tell me you love me
Now I'm old enough to know
That this will never be but I don't care
The only way that you can show
How you care and how you love
Is to hurt me and hide yourself
Now I'm old enough to know
Years have passed and years will go
Unset time. Unset place.
Not necessarily a spot in history.
The darkest time of humanity.
The darkest season of earth.
Nothing grows. Nothing evolves.
Darkness covers almost all land.
Unknown if there are any plants or animals
And right in the middle of dark
A small place where humans live
Or something that reminds of living.
No hope in their aching hearts.
No smile on their broken faces.
And this goes on and on for years and years and years...
And as they fear more and they lose hope
The dark comes closer and closer.
His parents do not differ from other members
He Hopes. And Fears. But still Hopes.
And he gets sick of fear.
He gets bored of not exploring.
Not the dark but his heart. His Burning Heart.
And day after day frightened people
Everyone thinks it's madness.
And some day more and more live off his hope.
Everyone is moving now. Moving into the dark.
And now the dark gets deeper.
It's aching to move now. Feet heavy.
And they go on and on.
Light spreads in the heart of black fog.
But dark now plays its dirtiest tricks
And hearts begin to freeze.
And more and more are screaming to go back.
Things get out of control.
No order in the moving tribe now.
They start to blame him.
He rips off his own heart from his wonderful chest.
Bleeding he holds it up and everyone sees
The most hopeful light they had ever seen.
And they go on really fast. No one screams now.
He looks to his heart and still feels close to it.
And after a while Dark begins to scatter and dawn comes
Everyone is cheering now. Everyone hopes.
And they are so happy they cannot see
A young man's dead body lying among them
I see you've fell down.
To everything there is a time
In the winter there is snow
But I'll calm you yes I'll do
All the days that seem to come
But the autumn brings the calmness
So I love you most of all
Please believe me please don't cry
All these things you've never tasted
All these years that seem so wasted
Never were and never will be
And the time has come
I'll give you my hand
The story of special times that follow special lines
I've grown accustomed to your face the shadows and the light
And if you want you can join me quietly
I carry you home on my back
All the way to you on the fastest track
We can run we can walk we can see when the dark sets in
And then I wave goodbye and I know I'll see you again
You took me by surprise
Never thought we'd share a mile and sometimes a disguise
A special bond built on trust the courage to climb hills
A place so far away from here with a certain thrill
And if you want you can join me quietly
I carry you home on my back
All the way to you on the fastest track
We can run we can walk we can see when the dark sets in
And then I wave goodbye and I know I'll see you again
I carry you home on my back
All the way to you on the fastest track
We can run we can walk we can see when the dark sets in
Not the question if we're going
It's where we're going to
We could take a ride through the night
And I heard there's something going down
We could see the others Having a great time
Stay whenever you stay
Let us go somewhere else tonight
Let us do something else
I called the others on the phone
They told me you won't come alone
That's why we'll pick you up at nine
Is it fine Evelyn you're on my mind
He's doing solo for his very first time
Or maybe we are going through
All the stuff we used to do
Happens to be not that much
Call it up just call it up
Stay whenever you stay
Let us go somewhere else tonight
Let us do something else
I called the others on the phone
They told me you won't come alone
That's why we'll pick you up at nine
Is it fine Evelyn you're on my mind
Stay whenever you stay
And friends will leave you more
This song remains through all
This song remains through all
Play in solo near the shore
Broken study like before
And friends will leave you more
This song remains through all
Free me on your way to blush
Leave me high and be my lover
And burn the other life
Whether you're falling on down
Or whether you're falling on
It's just another time
And whether you're happy or not
I can feel it in my bones
And whether you're happy or not
I can feel it in my bones
Keep me dry and be my brother
And blur the other life
I believe in holes in heaven
Whether you're falling on down
Or whether you're falling on
It's just another time
And whether you're happy or not
I can feel it in my bones
It's just another time
And whether you're happy or not
I can feel it in my bones
It's just another time
And whether you're happy or not
I can feel it in my bones
You will find your way
And you wish it would rain
But it won't hurt a bit
Like a kiss on your lips
There's a hole in the night
The night won't wait forever
It keeps getting better
There is nothing to fear
There's a light in your eyes
You can drop your disguise
And there's so much loving to do
You're high as a kite
Head full of stars you are
You will find you are home
And you wish it would rain
But it won't hurt a bit
Like a kiss on your lips
There's a hole in the night
There is nothing to fear
There's a light in your eyes
You can drop your disguise
And there's so much loving to do
There's so much loving to do
There's so much loving to do
I love you just the way you are
The road's so fast so you will fall
You know that you've already got it all
It doesn't matter what you do
It doesn't matter what you say
To gain the world but lose your soul
Well I don't need to weigh it up to know
It doesn't matter what you do
It doesn't matter what you say
It doesn't matter if you fall
It doesn't matter if you run away
All these lines upon your face
So scared to live without a trace
Tried to outrun the setting sun
But there's enough for everyone
You could keep digging up china oh
But you would never find it no no
Searching so hard for your happiness
But it's not where you think it is
It doesn't matter what you do
It doesn't matter what you say
It doesn't matter if you fall
It doesn't matter if you run away
It doesn't matter what you do
It doesn't matter what you say
It doesn't matter if you fall
All my lights are out
This is not my kind of bliss
My painted lips are numb
In this stranger's empty kiss
I saw shadows at your feet
My empty shoes have left me here
I knew then that the rain would come
When we watched the rainbow disappear
I'm not staring into space
Even to the lack of you
I'm not running movies in my head
I'm not searching for your feet in bed
Baby I'm not making tea for two
I'm not staring into space
I'll wake up singing again
For the first time and forever
I say a million times goodnight
It seems easier to love everybody
Than to love just one man right
I'm not staring into space
I'm not staring into space
If I told you a secret
Where we go from here
We keep spinning round in circles
I can't see the future
I wanna laugh like I used to
Cry like I could with you
Come lay down beside me
And I'll tell you a story
Lay your head upon your pillow
Look outside your window
We've had a lot of weather
The winds are calling me
You know I wanna know what peace is
But I pulled it all to pieces
Now we need all the king's horses
You know I wanna know what peace is
But I pulled it all to pieces
Now we need all the king's horses
Come lay down beside me
And I'll tell you a story
Lay your head upon your pillow
Look outside your window
If we're saying goodbye
I'll see you in the night sky
We can while away the afternoon
Just to step out of time is all we need
Looking out for the other rule
We can watch the world roll on by
Dreaming up all the endless possibilities
Staring into the open sky
Watch the blues get blown away
We don't have to talk at all
If we lie on our backs in the green green grass
I guarantee there's no way to fall
And together watch the blues get blown away
When you let me know what's going on inside
But now you're standing so bare
But now your fingers start to curl
I lay my head against the stone
That love comes and it goes
To stick around this time
I touched the bottom of the cake
And now I don't know what to say
But you are just a room away
Are you a memory or are you a dream
I seem to conjure you from both
Love comes and it goes
Stick around this time
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings
You've got the world at your feet
You've got them dancing in the street
You've got them wrapped around your fingertips
You never tried to be a star
Brighter than the galaxy
These four leaf clovers
You're high like heaven now
And there are locks around your head
A choir of angels round your bed
And when you sleep you fly above this land
You wake with scratches on your feet
You're jumping over these four leaf clovers
You're high like heaven now
But they've never shown you
A reason to come down
You're just like a bird
You break like a child
When you fall from the sky
And they wanna rescue thee
But there are ropes they cannot see
The gods will never ever lose their grip
Many men have tried before
But felt like soon as they leave shore
They summon seas to sink their pretty ship
But you're jumping over
These four leaf clovers
You're high like heaven now
But they've never shown you
A reason to come down
But they've never shown you
A reason to come down
One false move away from you
I couldn't leave now if I wanted to
I'm too far gone to turn from you
I was not the type to fall from grace
But I lost my footing when I saw your face
And I'd break every rule I make
I played out this scene a hundred times
But now I look at your mouth and I forget my lines
You draw me in just like a cigarette
One morning dawn with a head full of regret
My life is made up with the things I said I wouldn't do
Now here I am standing in front of you
It seems there's only trouble and desire
It's only love that I'm seeking
It's only love that I'm seeking
I can't yell any louder
I can't breathe any deeper
I can't hold on a little longer
I can't sing any stronger
I can't keep this type from rising
I can't contain this yearning
I can't stop this fire
One false move away from you
I couldn't leave now if I wanted to
I'm too far gone to turn from you
Its only love that I'm seeking
It's only love that I'm seeking
It's only love that I'm seeking
Its only love that I'm seeking
You've been crying for too long
You've been hiding out in the dark
Trying to work out what went wrong
And I know that it's not easy
With these monsters in your head
It's been weeks now baby
You've been locked behind your door
It's okay to come out
It's time for you to swim to shore
And I know that it's not easy
With these sharks around your bed
You're free as a bird
You're free as a bird
That we've got nothing
That we've got nothing
That we've got nothing
There's a world inside my head
I've been running into trouble
Well mostly I've been walking
Having conversations with God
Where I do all the talking
Just to find the will to live
Is a search that takes me far and wide
Sometimes the suburbs of paradise
Leave a lot to be desired
As I crawl around my house
I think I could just disappear
I keep looking in the mirror
Just to see if I'm still here
Maybe we could overthrow
The political campaign
With all this blood on our hands
We've only got ourselves to blame
The road ahead is all the shiver
All the sins of the father
That I'm trying to forget
To let just a little in
There's a murmur in my heart
But it might be only spring
I thought the hustle way for me was etched in stones
Until my pun to dime and name etched in stone
But a lifetime of scars only sixteen bars
So I took the vibe with me using my life
And if I need to bring the girls together music's my dice
If I degraded and I haven't even cried to
Music ain't the knowledge itself
Beating up the track with brutal lines
I'm using the inspiration that they provide to me
Now all the people who go irresponsibly
Thinking your album is trash is not the root of economy
So you're expecting the conscious and introspect of use
My music gives you a message true or respect is due
A tree in form of a far is never heard
Amongst the sparrows and the robbers and even the ghetto birds
You download it for free but what I create the same
When you reach the crossroads me and the devil have to meet
It's all the same thing as clever Lauryn when they saw it
Willing to the same songs but we hear them different
Serenade the death like we got a fear of living
Having the sounds on stage cause the spirit rising
Stop the devilish ways where clever displays the lyricism
The songs are a natural resource of actual street stories
Attract the police forces
Slay to the rhythm the masses that rip off us
When words are not enough
Too few won't sum it up
But still don't know the way
But I'd just lead you astray
Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies
If you wanna be with me
Don't look to closely or you'll see my disguise
I saw the love between us die
But But I'm not ready for goodbye
You won't find at my door
My heart already knows
But my head won't let you go
Please try and understand
But half of me is gone
The pieces of my heart
Are lying on the floor
It's been broken up before
It can't be broken anymore
And I'll tell you no lies
If you wanna be with me
Don't look too closely
Or you'll see my disguise
I don't want to live a lie
But I can not say another goodbye
You won't find at my door
My heart already knows
But my head won't let you go
Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies
If you wanna be with me
Don't look too closely
Or you'll see my disguise
I don't wanna live a lie
But I can not say another goodbye
You won't find at my door
My heart already knows
But my head won't let you go
You won't find at my door
My heart already knows
But my head won't let you go
Where the talent is surrounded by the pain and the violence
So the selling never safe
At the same time snitching to the Jake
Is the quickest way to get found at the bottom of a lake
But the problem we face seems so great
That we can't escape so we accept our fate
So the sex and the money and the murder are the pictures we paint
If an artist is a part of a community
And got an opportunity to get that cake
No different from a snake
Nothing left to give cause you always wanna take
If you ain't using all the talents God provided you with
Look into the face of a young girl
Raising up like a flag when it's unfurled
Got game listening to her mother's pearls
Her mama used to run this city
When it came to the music then she got real picky
Plus she never went to college
She God in the physical
And it's only natural to pray for a little you
Musical so she played the umbilical chords
So her daughter was born it was a miracle
Music is the light when it's dark
And the way that you spit your dart is a big part
She grew up loving hip hop
Ratchet reality stars that be looking so stupid
Getting in the fights at reunions
No desire for the lying and the violence
Lost count of how many whores she was called today
But it's only so much she can tolerate
Help me find my way to a state of grace
Feed me freedom sounds you made
Help me find my way to a state of grace
Lift me up with your weight
She wanna to be the first in her family with a higher education
Her entire graduation was a dire situation
Did a paper on the state of the hip hop generation
But no longer felt a part of the conversation
Major label seeing a profit
She ain't never been a bitch or a ho
But she used to sing along when she heard it in a song
She used to be front row at the shows till she overdosed on the testosterone
Her favorite rapper invited her backstage would have stayed
But she felt like she really ain't belong
She erased all her songs from the phone
She tried not to judge him
In her heart she still loved him
And the way that he lusting a part of his suffering
And this young man clearly not ready for the harder discussion
I know a few who flow crazier than if you flew over the nest of the cuckoo
But she never gonna hear them in the mix so the new attitude
Help me find my way to a state of grace
Feed me freedom sounds you made
Help me find my way to a state of grace
Lift me up with your weight
She'd be lucky for a balance cause the world is challenging her to be great
I see lyrics as colors and shapes
When you wish you could switch the way that you look
And your nose was smaller and your hair was straight
When you got no faith
Let's get to the core
And you rich and you shit on the poor
And make you dismissive of the efforts of those who get left
Ain't no reason to touch the radio dial
You wonder why you don't hear no sounds on the air
And it's clear that your sales going down
Down by law then you found the raw
On a message board and you sounding off
All the time that you spent listening to that bullshit
Help me find my way to a state of grace
Feed me freedom sounds you made
Help me find my way to a state of grace
Lift me up with your weight
Don't you get this reality
Don't hide your curiosity
The thing's hard to find
I know it's in you and me
Like the river flows to the ocean
We just keep moving on
You're reaching the destiny
You're getting the eternity
You know it's just you and me
Our love is growing strong
Like the rain falls to the dry ground
We must keep going on
Whenever you just call my name
Anytime we can feel each other
Like the river flows to the ocean
We just keep moving on
Our love is growing strong
Like the rain falls to the dry ground
We must keep going on
A night sky full of cries
Hearts filled with lies
A soul pledged to the darkness
I don't want anything anymore
I don't feel the way as before
Sun will rise Close your eyes
Just HOWLING in the shadows
I don't need anything anymore
I don't see the way as before
Sun will rise Close your eyes
Give me sight to see inside
Take a bite night by night
And you were my everything
Tell me why I lost my mind
Tell me why I keep closing my eyes
Tell me why I missed to find
Nothing can steal my soul away
Nothing stands in my way
Why don't you turn to me again
Why don't you heal me then
I'm coming down to you
Wanna love your anything
Tell me why you lost your mind
Tell me why you keep closing your eyes
Tell me why you missed to find
Nothing can steal my soul away
Nothing keeps me away
No one can take my breath away
No one can lead my way
I'm still in love with you
Nothing can steal my soul away
Nothing stands in my way
Why don't you turn to me again
Why don't you heal me then
Nothing can steal my soul away
No one can take my breath away
I hear you talk about it
I see you write about it
If you have nothing to lose
And you're the one to blame
You always hang around me
Everything is feeling wrong
When you don't need me
Blowing through my mind
Feel like I'm losing myself
I fall into the edge of night
I still can't work it out
Please take me to the other side
You always hang around me
Everything is feeling wrong
When you don't need me
Blowing through my mind
Feel like I'm losing myself
I fall into the edge of night
I still can't work it out
Please take me to the other side
I've been asking to myself
What this crazy feeling means to me
I need so much more than I can give
Trying not to think of you
Tell me where you have been hiding out
There must be something I can do
Take you all the way now
You are the reason I'm alive
Remember the night I held you tight
Before you go make me cry
I've been talking to myself
What this dizzy feeling means to me
You need so much more than you can give
Trying not to look for you
Tell me what you have been keeping up
There must be somewhere I can go
Take you all the way now
I am the reason you're alive
Remember the night I held you tight
Before you go play on me
Speak with your true mind
Before you deny yourself
You are the reason I'm alive
I can't take this any longer honey
Remember the night I held you tight
Before you go make me cry
No need to stay just free yourself
No doubt to say I lose myself
Why don't you disclose what's inside
Sweetest Chaotic Coma Again
I knew you before about five years ago
Then you seemed to be like a person
Who didn't act like the people i knew
Yes something was special about you
A bit insecure but still kind of cute
At the same time easy to talk to
And now i see you again
And you're looking so good
You're the same kind of person you're like me
And I can't run away I'm so attracted by you
You're what I've been searching for
I wanna give you a better life
She leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life
And the day had just begun
It's a day for catching tan
Just laying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
So if you are in sight and the day is right
The gentle voice that talks to you
It is a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
Maybe he like to brag
Did he invent himself
He live till the end of time
Oh Münchhausen was a sun of a gun
He had his share of wild adventures
He rode the cannonball like no other man
And pulled himself up in the air
Whether he liked to brag
He lives till the end of time
With his immortal lies
Oh Münchhausen took a trip to the moon
And beat the sultan and his navy
With a company containing just five
He gunned them down just by himself
Such a special baron man Münchhausen
He spread chaos around the world
Where the people understand
And dream of perfect man
A situation leading to sweet salvation
For mankind brotherhood
We're traveling in time
Ideas by man and only that will last
And over time we learned from the past
That no man's fit to rule the world alone
A man will die but not his ideas
Where the people understand
And dream of perfect man
A situation leading to sweet salvation
For mankind brotherhood
We're traveling in time
Come through and I will dance with you
Where the people understand
And dream of perfect man
A situation leading to sweet salvation
For mankind brotherhood
Waiting for you waiting for magic
A man of the world but lost in a dream
You look at something from a different angle
But I exist I'm waiting for you
In a coffin made of glass
In your dream a girl is dancing
Once a witch made her sleep
But a prince will wake her up it's you
In the tale is the place to find her
Reach out to get to know her
It means so much to me
The meaning of the book
Join in the story of the fairytale
Believe the dream you will not fail
Waiting for magic it's what I do
Waiting for magic for me and you to kiss me
Caught in a dream how lucky you are
You can see me I'm the girl behind you
So open your eyes and turn around
And watch me dancing join the fairy tales
You cannot reach her on the planet
That the scientists want to call the earth
But if you use your imagination you will see her
You will find her in your dreams
I see no shadows in my dreams
It is something so romantic
Tonight we're gonna have a good time
Oh we're really gonna have a good time
Tonight we're gonna have a good time
Oh we're really gonna have a good time
Confess you look at her
Confess you'd like to be with her
Confess you look at her
Confess you'd like to be with her
Confess you look at her
My love is my engine and you might be fuel
I'm in love with another fool
My love is my engine and you might be fuel
Just bet you might win
We're gonna make you move
Like a stab from a knife
My love is my engine and you might be fuel
Just bet you might win
What an odd situation
What an odd situation
I want to be your lover but you're so shy
What you need is perfect assistance let me guide you
To a land you've never seen before
I guess you see that I have another daydream
I guess you see that I have another daydream
Dance into my daydream
Join me in my daydream wet and wild
Dance into my daydream
Join me in the jungle wet and wild
To help another person will make you feel important
You got my invitation but you're so shy
Come and let your wild side show and be a dancer
A dancer in a daydream we can share
Help me take control of my fool imagination
I'm looking for a man that will match my situation
I'm thinking about the people waiting down the line
Ace of Base is in your mind
Ace of Base is in your mind
You're giving me hope
I'm moving back in time
You're giving me hope
I'm moving back in time
In my mind in my mind in my mind
You're giving me hope

We're gonna make you move

What you gonna tell your dad
What you gonna tell your dad
Each citizen's city life
What you gonna tell your dad
It's like a wheel of fortune
What you gonna tell your dad

Tastes like steel like a stab from a knife
What you gonna tell your dad

What you gonna tell your dad
Everybody let me seek the town
What you gonna tell your dad
Everybody let me seek the town
What you gonna tell your dad
We are much too young and life's so big
We don't know yet what the future brings
What tomorrow brings the future knows
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
We are marching on the same side of destiny
On the same side of destiny
I'm calling out your name
But you never hear me
I'm giving you my love no it's never for sex
And we're so young and proud
I'm calling out your name
I'm calling out your name
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy

I will survive without you
Don't tell me that you wanna leave
I won't beg you to stay
Maybe it's better that way
Don't worry about this heart of mine
Just walk out that door
I don't want you seeing me cry
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
But I won't let you know
I won't miss your arms around me
If you ever think about me
Don't worry about this heart of mine
Sure I'll make it through
And I'll even learn to live without you
I don't want you seeing me cry
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
But I won't let you know
I wish I could scream out loud that I love you
As he walks away he feels the pain getting strong
People in your life they don't know what's going on
Too proud to turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
You would hardly recognize me
Life is demanding without understanding
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
For so many years I wondered
Where I see a lot of stars
Life is demanding without understanding
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
And it opened up my mind
And I am happy now living without you
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
You're living your life in peace and in harmony
That's how it's got to be for you and me
Without no sense of logic
You'll be living in danger
You'll be living in danger
You'll be living in danger
People are the same today as they used to be
The same expectations
We'll never get enough
You'll be living in danger
You'll be living in danger
You'll be living in danger
People are the same today as they used to be
We'll never get enough
You'll be living in danger
You'll be living in danger
You'll be living in danger
You'll be living in danger
I enter your life now make no mistake
I enter your life now make no mistake
Can you hear me calling in the night
My love's so strong I can't get it right
You've got me totally hypnotized
I came in a black dress but left in a white
I came in a black dress but left in a white
Can you hear me calling in the night
My love's so strong I can't get it right
You've got me totally hypnotized
Looking for your eyes
When the dream is so nice
The rhythm of the song where you belong
I want your heart and soul
You can reach me you can reach me
You can reach me you can touch me
Can you hear me calling in the night
My love's so strong I can't get it right
You've got me totally hypnotized
Hypnotized I am hypnotized

Tell them we've gone too far

She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
What you're doing tomorrow's gonna come your way
Don't you ever consider giving up
I just wanna be here beside you
And stay until the break of dawn
Take a walk in the park when you feel down
There's so many things there that's gonna lift you up
I just wanna be here beside you
I just wanna be here beside you
And stay until the break of dawn
You're looking for somewhere to belong
You're standing all alone
For someone to guide you on your way
I just wanna be anybody
I'm gonna take you in my arms and fly away with you tonight
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
I'm never gonna say I'm sorry
I'm a clown for everyone
I'm never gonna let you down
I'm always here like a sun
I'm never gonna say I'm sorry
I'm a clown for everyone
I'm never gonna let you down
I'm always here like a sun
I am happy even if you don't want
To invite me out for a dance tonight
I'm never gonna say I'm sorry
I'm a clown for everyone
I'm never gonna let you down
I'm always here like a sun
I'm never gonna say I'm sorry
I'm a clown for everyone
I'm never gonna let you down
I'm always here like a sun
I'm always here like a sun
Like a ghost I follow your steps so true
You don't have to bribe me or fill me up
Give me just a minute to shine with you
I am never gonna say I'm sorry
For the essence of my soul
There's so many ways to change my life
I'm never gonna say I'm sorry
I'm a clown for everyone
I'm never gonna let you down
I'm always here like a sun
I'm never gonna say I'm sorry
I'm a clown for everyone
I'm never gonna let you down
I am never gonna say I'm sorry
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I believe life could be paradise once again
And the love we thought we lost is sleeping within
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
We are young and we are old
And your heart's so full of soul
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
Was what you need to see the light
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
And as the sun goes down
It starts to paint a picture
And take me to the edge of heaven
I am standing in the night
Looking for the edge of heaven
We'll be touching the edge of heaven
The wheels are turning till eternity
And as the darkness comes
I start to see a picture
So clearly now reaching out for me
Lead me to the light...
And sail the endless sea
So lead me to the light
And take me to the edge of heaven
The edge of heaven is near
I've got strange ways
But it won't take long my friend
I'm telling you someday baby
I've got strange ways
But it won't take long my friend
I'm telling you someday baby
Again I've got no one
But it won't take long my friend
I'm telling you someday baby
God bless you for being
By my side when I fell through
You could hear me you've got
Internet gateways through my world
God bless you I'm feeling all the
Force you're closing in
You dock at my side when
I've got strange ways...
But I do hope you follow
God bless you for being
By my side when I fell through
You could hear me you've got
Internet gateways through my world
You're turning all this stone into a heart
As you fight the fire
Wanna know what she learned
Like humility you win when you lose
The most horrifying nights have an end
In the dark I found my way to a friend
I am standing here in my ravine
Once again I see a piece of the sky
The only place on earth
And I let the trees grow wild around me
Shaded everything I needed to see
Took a knife and ripped me up by my roots
In my darkest night I started to pray
I am standing here in my ravine
Once again I see a piece of the sky
The only place on earth
He was the only one there
Well I am standing here in my ravine
Once again I see a piece of the sky
And my joy never will be denied
The only place on earth
I am standing here in my ravine
Once again I see a piece of the sky
The only place on earth
They say the time has come for us to start again
I believe that's true
They say the time has come for us to make amends
And I believe that too
Where children are laughing
There's nothing to cry for
Our father's father says that things were better than
On every page in every book of history a thousand tears were shed
There's hope in our hearts and love in our eyes
Day after day I keep searching
For a perfect world...
Show me the way I'm to understand
That you prove to myself that I'm a man
Travel cross the seven seas to be with you
Passion and desire will see me through
The road that I must travel will wind and curl
I know that I'm not the first one
You had love in your path before me
It felt like I was kissing destiny
Angel eyes with your angel eyes
Will you always be there to hold me
Angel eyes I'm satisfied
I don't want to hear your story
I believe in what I'm feeling
I'd give everything up just for you
Angel eyes with your angel eyes
Will you always be there to hold me
Angel eyes I'm satisfied
I don't want to hear your story
Angel eyes just want you here to hold me
If you do want me you know where to search
We'll get the magic back again
If you do want me you know where to search
I wanna see you dancing naked
I wanna see you touch the moon
But when I try to reach your fingers
You just vanish into air
I wanna feel you with my senses
Is gonna tell me who you are
I wanna hold you like I used to
I wanna feel you in my blood
I wonder why I do confess this
To myself all the time
I know the time is working against us
But I'll long for you the rest of my whole life
Like a prisoner of hope
I have tried to get to know you
To get you off my mind
It feels like going back in time
If you do want me you know where to search
You are reliable as a painting in wave wet sand
I look in your eyes and I can't see a thing
That usually means attraction to me
I've read all the books about love I could find
And I am just another piece of an island in reach for your hands
You must tell me so or go elsewhere to hunt
I am just another piece of an island
I can't close my ears when I hear that you call
I don't want to fear every tear that could fall
My goal is to find a piece of your love
You are like the water
You are like the water
They call to her from across the street
But they don't know her name
She's in the wrong place at the wrong time
She wonders how to change
The life she's living
She wonders if she'll ever get away
The game goes on and on and
I like you but I don't
Really want to take you home
She left her home when she was seventeen
Simply disappeared in the rain
Those were bad times so it was high times
She knows she'd do it again
She's going to make a living
She wonders if she'll make it through the day
A lonely girl in a big bad world
The games goes on and on and
I'm driving through the night
I'm driving through the rain
I'm on my way from Mr Pain
My eyes keep seeing what my mind wants to forget
They rock and roll inside my head
Over and over and over again
I concentrate harder and harder and then
The wolves cry out tonight
I see your broken line
The sun will rise without a love
I always think about the way you had to leave
Faster and faster and faster ahead
As if you are waiting for me down the way
Faster and faster and faster ahead
As if you are waiting for me down the way
I have never seen you
Give me all your tears. Let me turn them to pearls
Let me turn all the tears
That you have cried into pearls
I want to mend what is broken
And so I've made up my mind
I'm gonna be yours this time
I'm gonna give all I've got
And get your love in return
And so I've made up my mind
I'm gonna be yours this time
I'm gonna teach you to trust
And learn how to burn
When sand strikes up in your eyes
I will cover your face
I'll plant your desert with roses
And so I've made up my mind...
I'll wear your pearls more precious than silver
I'll wear your pearls so close to my skin
I'll tear myself apart just to get you
Darling you were looking good
And asked for a dance
Swedish summer nights are hot
And the trees can talk
Whispers in blindness
And I didn't hold you back
Stay with me and I shall want no other love
Stay with me another love another lie
Stay with me and I shall want no other love
You were talking so sweet
But you were touching and teasing
I can hear the soft bells ring
Through a thousand years
They say it's only once in a life we love
Now I've had that honor too
You were holding my hand
You were kissing my skin
You've already broken your mother's heart
When I was your age working my ass off
Your generation's soft
Reality is always such a drag
For barely blooming eighteens
The barely blooming eighteen
What's keeping her from searching
You cannot pierce that and
You're dressed too tight
Got a lot to learn about wrong and right
So dye your hair dad's goon wash it out
Come on wash your mouth
Reality is always such a drag
For barely blooming eighteens
The barely blooming eighteen
What's hiding in the shadow
Reality is always such a drag
For barely blooming eighteens
The barely blooming eighteen
What's keeping her from searching
You cannot pierce that and
You're dressed too tight
Got a lot to learn about wrong and right
So dye your hair dad's goon wash it out
Come on wash your mouth
Reality is always such a drag
For barely blooming eighteens
The barely blooming eighteen
Reality is always such a drag
For barely blooming eighteens
The barely blooming eighteen
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I believe life could be paradise once again
And the love we thought we lost is sleeping within
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
We are young and we are old
And your heart's so full of soul
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
You make me come alive
You make me come alive
Someone maybe try to lay hurt on you
I will hunt them down and blow them away
And the city prays at our feet tonight
You and I were only animals
Live and die like burning candles yeah
And nothing left to lose
You and I we're like a perfect team
You and I live in an orange dream
You and I we're up against the wall
We got to beat them all
To be invincible... yeah
Will I ever be on my own again
Baby you got eyes that shine in the dark
Let the beat go on in the world tonight
You and I don't care what people say
You and I are living day to day
Never die our love's immortalized
You make me come alive
We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
And the world will smile with you
So precious in your hand
And the world will smile with you
When every race is run
And the day is closing in
I don't care about the world
I'm living for the light
We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
And the world will smile with you
So precious in your hand
And the world will smile with you
I can not be your judge
Mr. Jailer is your host
He's keeping you inside
And hides you from the world
No catcher in the rye can help you from yourself
We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
And the world will smile with you
So precious in your hand
And the world will smile with you
Release them for a while
Learn them the consequences of
We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
And the world will smile with you
So precious in your hand
And the world will smile with you
I whistle down the wind
And the world will smile with you
So precious in your hand
And the world will smile with you
And the world will smile with you
And the world will smile with you
And the world will smile with you
I was mesmerized when I first met you
I wouldn't let myself believe
That you could step right out of my wildest dreams
But you didn't know that secret part of me
Until we kissed and made it open up so easily
You know that I just wanna touch you whenever you're close to me
You know that I just wanna show you just how much you mean to me
Everything that you give into
Everything you'll ever need
Is locked up somewhere deep inside of me
You gotta know but more importantly
You've got to stay and hold me while we live this fantasy
You know that I just wanna touch you whenever you're close to me
You know that I just wanna show you just how much you mean to me
Sometimes we try too hard to please
We should let love come naturally
And sometimes I don't know just what you really do to me
You know that I just wanna touch you whenever you're close to me
You know that I just wanna show you just how much you mean to me
You know that I just wanna touch you whenever you're close to me
Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning as I sit around
Trying to smile but the air is so heavy and dry
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort this heat has got right out of hand
The city is crowded my friends are away and I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle so I've gotta get up and go
Funny how everything changes for me
Memories take me away
Each time I open the door to my room
Where I must stay in all day
Lying in the sunshine
Where nothing but the blue skies
Will tell me that the time flies
Every time I think of you
You're giving me my life back
One day I'll give you myself in a ring
Bounded by law and by heart
It's you and me against the world
That is the way it should be
We are on vacation you and me together
Lying in the sunshine
Where nothing but the blue skies
Will tell me that the time flies
And every time I think of you
You're giving me my life back
You are the best that has happened to me
You're giving me my life back
You are the best that has happened to me
Where nothing but the blue skies
Will tell me that the time flies
Every time I think of you
You're giving me my life back
Where nothing but the blue skies
Will tell me that the time flies
Every time I think of you
You're giving me my life back
We wanna be alone tonight
Out in the open you are here
Adventures in paradise
We wanna be alone tonight
Exploring what the nature brings
Adventures in paradise
Adventures in paradise
Oh give me what I need tonight
Oh you know what I want tonight
Adventures in paradise

And will stories then be told
Of what we did here tonight
You will always be my number one
Oh give me what I need tonight
Oh you know what I want tonight
Adventures in paradise
Oh give me what I need tonight
Oh you know what I want tonight
Adventures in paradise
Oh give me what I need tonight

We will never know the answer to that question
Simon and Garfunkel had a little problem
Passion changes but they will still remember you
I say they loved you and they would do the same for you today
We'll never know the answer to that question
According to a well known song
I've been trying to overcome the mental blocks I've got
Can't you hear them whispering
Around you all the time
Can't you tell the difference between
Things when you're in love
I hear your voice is trembling
Every time when he's around
Your detached engagements
He decides whether you should smile
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be happy
He decides whether you should smile
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be sad
If he doesn't love you you're afraid that you can't go on
If he really loves you let him show you that instead
He decides whether you should smile
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be happy
He decides whether you should smile
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be sad
This love might change your world around
Whether you should go
When I was young I dreamed about
When I was young I never thought I'd be afraid
The years go by and with them comes
I pray there's another day
Sunshine on the morning water
I pray there will be an answer
And in my youth I realized nothing lasts forever
I find myself remembering those happy days
I pray there's another day
Sunshine on the morning water
I pray there will be an answer
You don't have a second left to hesitate
Nothing you can do will break the fall
Tell me what are you seeing
If you want to be free
Turn around expectations
I pray there's another day
Sunshine on the morning water
I pray there will be an answer
I pray there's another day
Sunshine on the morning water
I pray there will be an answer
I pray there's another day
I pray there will be an answer
You've got the moves to rule the world
Shaking up hearts around the world
You can't forget that stunning face
Smiling at you it's your destiny
She's got the face sweet as a baby
Elegant taste and money to burn
Her language is so hard to learn
You've got the moves to rule the world
Though there's a fire burns inside her
Nothing she wants is denied her
You'd better take my advice
Many have tried to get near her
Deep in the heart of Tokyo
Found nothing there but a mirror
She's no one you'll ever know
You've got the moves to rule the world
She's got the face sweet as a baby
Elegant taste and money to burn
Her language is so hard to learn
You've got the moves to rule the world
Shaking up hearts around the world
You can't forget that stunning face
Smiling at you it's your destiny
One step into the night
Don't mind the weather
It's raining in my heart tonight
Two wrongs don't make a right
You're gonna regret it
When you're looking back
Make the most of this love I'm giving
Better take another look at my face
Some dream of fortune
Seconds after leaving
It didn't mean a thing
Make the most of this love I'm giving
Better take another look at my face
Do you wanna be more than a picture hanging on the wall
Something to remind me of how it all went wrong
Do you wanna be more than a number forgotten in a book
You're gonna regret it
When you're looking back
Make the most of this love I'm giving
Better take another look at my face
Take another look on your way
Take another look on your way
Take a voyage to the bottom of the sea
He's a riddle you will see in the middle of the sea
If you ask him things about life then he will say
I don't interfere in your life
See me as a searcher with the answers
To your world from under the sea
What control of light and darkness means
If we come in peace at heart
He may help us to restart what went wrong
So long ago from down below
I don't interfere in your life
See me as a searcher with the answers
To your world from under the sea
See him as a searcher with the answers to mankind
He's far to continental
Though he's wiser than all man
He is curious about the plan
Violated by the man the master plan
He don't interfere in your life
See him as a searcher with the answers
To your world from under the sea
He don't interfere in your life
See him as a searcher with the answers
To your world from under the sea
Donnie's got a secret and you know it
He promised you to stay forever
It's so bittersweet now
When you know what you lost
Donnie was the boy you always wanted by your side
Donnie was the boy your girlfriends fell for one by one
Donnie was the boy you always wanted day and night
He's always on your mind
But that chapter of love stays unfinished for you
Keep on dancing through your new life
As the flower you are
Donnie was the boy you always wanted by your side
Donnie was the boy your girlfriends fell for one by one
Donnie was the boy you always wanted day and night
On the beach you had him long ago
On the beach you had him long ago
Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning as I sit around
Trying to smile but the air is so heavy and dry
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort this heat has got right out of hand
The city is crowded my friends are away and I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle so I've gotta get up and go
Whenever you're near me
I give you everything I have
Someone to believe in
When things are good or when they're bad
You know how to please me
Someone to believe in
I cannot wait to feel the beating of your heart
The days are long and they're just keeping us apart
Whenever you're near me
Whenever you're near me
Someone to believe in
When things are good or when they're bad
You know how to please me
Someone to believe in
I see dark clouds out my window
I know the storm is coming any minute
And the thunder just confirms my fears
And I know the tears are rimming
So many memories the rain releases
I know I'll never be with you again
I'll never find another with that kindness in his eyes
So many memories the rain releases
On sunny days I'm all right
And I try not to think about the love I live without
So many memories the rain releases
Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning as I sit around
Trying to smile but the air is so heavy and dry
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort this heat has got right out of hand
The city is crowded my friends are away and I'm on my own

We are on vacation you and me together
Lying in the sunshine
Where nothing but the blue skies
Will tell me that the time flies
And every time I think of you
You're giving me my life back
You are the best that has happened to me
You're giving me my life back
You are the best that has happened to me
Where nothing but the blue skies
Will tell me that the time flies
Every time I think of you
You're giving me my life back
Where nothing but the blue skies
Will tell me that the time flies
Every time I think of you
You're giving me my life back
Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning as I sit around
Trying to smile but the air is so heavy and dry
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort this heat has got right out of hand
The city is crowded my friends are away and I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle so I've gotta get up and go
We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
And the world will smile with you
So precious in your hand
And the world will smile with you
When every race is run
And the day is closing in
I don't care about the world
I'm living for the light
We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
And the world will smile with you
So precious in your hand
And the world will smile with you
I can not be your judge
Mr. Jailer is your host
He's keeping you inside
And hides you from the world
No catcher in the rye can help you from yourself
We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
And the world will smile with you
So precious in your hand
And the world will smile with you
Release them for a while
Learn them the consequences of
We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
And the world will smile with you
So precious in your hand
And the world will smile with you
I whistle down the wind
And the world will smile with you
So precious in your hand
And the world will smile with you
And the world will smile with you
And the world will smile with you
And the world will smile with you

Into the night of blue
Into the night of blue
I haven't heard your voice for a long long time
Still you have me hanging on the line
Haven't seen a smile upon my face
And I haven't slept a night for days
Into the night of blue
Life is empty and sad without you
Into the night of blue
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Life is empty and sad without you
In my mind are pictures of our past
Days out on the beach out in the sun
Night when I was still your only one
Into the night of blue...
Funny how these memories only lead me back to you
They lead me back to you
Into the night of blue
Into the night of blue
Haven't heard your voice for a long long time
Life is empty and sad without you
Life is empty and sad without you
Into the night of blue
Into the night of blue
I am as young as I'm feeling
I'm always 21 at heart
I bet she wonders who I am
There's a man for me to have and to hold
Easy come and easy go. once bitten but not for long
You would hardly recognize me
Life is demanding without understanding
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
For so many years I wondered
Where I see a lot of stars
Life is demanding without understanding
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
And it opened up my mind
And I am happy now living without you
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
What you're doing tomorrow's gonna come your way
Don't you ever consider giving up
I just wanna be here beside you
And stay until the break of dawn
Take a walk in the park when you feel down
There's so many things there that's gonna lift you up
I just wanna be here beside you
I just wanna be here beside you
And stay until the break of dawn
You're looking for somewhere to belong
You're standing all alone
For someone to guide you on your way
I just wanna be anybody
I'm gonna take you in my arms and fly away with you tonight
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
Coming from my work I'm tired
I see you get on my bus
And I think I know you
I move through the crowd so I can get a better look
I got what you're searching for
Everybody's looking for a crazy heart
Can't you see me I'm here
Weren't you the one who
Spilled my long drink over at a bar
Looking like a question mark you
Stood there wondering what to do
Here I'm standing next to you
Talk to me you're looking strange
Let me know if my presence is bothering you
Everybody's searching
Everybody's searching
I was mesmerized when I first met you
I wouldn't let myself believe
That you could step right out of my wildest dreams
But you didn't know that secret part of me
Until we kissed and made it open up so easily
You know that I just wanna touch you whenever you're close to me
You know that I just wanna show you just how much you mean to me
Everything that you give into
Everything you'll ever need
Is locked up somewhere deep inside of me
You gotta know but more importantly
You've got to stay and hold me while we live this fantasy
You know that I just wanna touch you whenever you're close to me
You know that I just wanna show you just how much you mean to me
Sometimes we try too hard to please
We should let love come naturally
And sometimes I don't know just what you really do to me
You know that I just wanna touch you whenever you're close to me
You know that I just wanna show you just how much you mean to me
You know that I just wanna touch you whenever you're close to me
We had a million of days
I know that our time has run out
You're my everlasting groove
In all our thoughts and we will meet again
Never leave me out here in the cold
Colors are fading like the leaves in November
We had a million of days...
I know where I rather would be
In the fairy tales of love
Where everything has a happy end
A world my friend in Fantasia land
In the fairy tales of love
For a moment a touch could feel
Like a vision of an angel
Always longing to have you near
Feel the power and the passion
Feel me slipping from your hands
She leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life
And the day had just begun
It's a day for catching tan
Just laying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
So if you are in sight and the day is right
The gentle voice that talks to you
It is a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
You're living your life in peace and in harmony
That's how it's got to be for you and me
Without no sense of logic
You'll be living in danger
You'll be living in danger
You'll be living in danger
People are the same today as they used to be
The same expectations
We'll never get enough
You'll be living in danger
You'll be living in danger
You'll be living in danger
People are the same today as they used to be
We'll never get enough
You'll be living in danger
You'll be living in danger
You'll be living in danger
You'll be living in danger
I see dark clouds out my window
I know the storm is coming any minute
And the thunder just confirms my fears
And I know the tears are rimming
So many memories the rain releases
I know I'll never be with you again
I'll never find another with that kindness in his eyes
So many memories the rain releases
On sunny days I'm all right
And I try not to think about the love I live without
So many memories the rain releases
I will survive without you
Don't tell me that you wanna leave
I won't beg you to stay
Maybe it's better that way
Don't worry about this heart of mine
Just walk out that door
I don't want you seeing me cry
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
But I won't let you know
I won't miss your arms around me
If you ever think about me
Don't worry about this heart of mine
Sure I'll make it through
And I'll even learn to live without you
I don't want you seeing me cry
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
But I won't let you know
I wish I could scream out loud that I love you
As he walks away he feels the pain getting strong
People in your life they don't know what's going on
Too proud to turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning as I sit around
Trying to smile but the air is so heavy and dry
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort this heat has got right out of hand
The city is crowded my friends are away and I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle so I've gotta get up and go
Where the people understand
And dream of perfect man
A situation leading to sweet salvation
For mankind brotherhood
We're traveling in time
Ideas by man and only that will last
And over time we learned from the past
That no man's fit to rule the world alone
A man will die but not his ideas
Where the people understand
And dream of perfect man
A situation leading to sweet salvation
For mankind brotherhood
We're traveling in time
Come through and I will dance with you
Where the people understand
And dream of perfect man
A situation leading to sweet salvation
For mankind brotherhood

For the essence of my soul
There's so many ways to change my life
I'm never gonna say I'm sorry
I'm a clown for everyone
I'm never gonna let you down
I'm always here like a sun
I'm never gonna say I'm sorry
I'm a clown for everyone
I'm never gonna let you down
I am never gonna say I'm sorry

I'm in love with another fool
My love is my engine and you might be fuel
Just bet you might win
We're gonna make you move
Like a stab from a knife
My love is my engine and you might be fuel
Just bet you might win

All I wanna say to you
I was unfeeling when you discovered me
Gave me a reason to not deny my needs
I was unwilling to give my love away
But you decided to give yours anyway
The feelings I possess
All I wanna say to you
All I wanna say to you
Words can't describe it
All I wanna say to you
All I wanna say to you
Never thought I needed someone to call my own
The feelings I possess
All I wanna say to you
All I wanna say to you
Words can't describe it
All I wanna say to you
All I wanna say to you
Never had this feeling that brings me to my knees
You helped me recover what's been eluding me
You're a sensation that makes my love run free
All I wanna say to you
All I wanna say to you
Words can't describe it
All I wanna say to you
All I wanna say to you
Words can't define it

What a beautiful morning
The best in life is free
Yesterdays hard work still in my head
Cause this new day makes me dance on air
What a beautiful morning in my life
The best in life is free
And I wonder what more is to come
Let this beautiful morning change my mind
Believe me when I say
And we write new chapters of our lives
Keep the focus on the rising sun
What a beautiful morning in my life
The best in life is free
And I wonder what more is to come
And this beautiful morning changed my mind
Believe me when I say
Crows will always fly
And you will see things in a different light
What a beautiful morning
You got to believe me
When you're down on your knees and without a friend
Standing afraid at the very end
Try to forget what you're going through
Think of the things that you're gonna do
Just remember the words
Just remember the words
We're gonna work it until we drop
Don't ever think you're on your own
Just remember the words
You got to believe me
There's reason why you're crying
And whatever you may do
Don't forget to keep on trying
I said believe in you
You're living in a dreamer's dream
But touch you I cannot do
To greetings to understand
You will find me waiting out in the dark
I'm your everlasting property
You're the one I'm living for and feed
I'm telling you I am your friend
But you can hear me in your dream
You're living in a dreamer's dream
Gone with the wind I am not
Is a hard thing to do
I'm longing to see the offspring of me
To hold it with my bare hands
So talk about me as you used to do
I'm with you from time to time
You will find me waiting out in the dark
I'm your everlasting property
You're the one I'm living for
And feed all the time
With your deeds all the time
I'm telling you I am your friend
But you can't hear me in your dream
You're living in a dreamer's dream
Gone with the wind I am not
And I visit you too a lot
Is a hard thing to do
But you can hear me in your dream
I believe in there's a world down under
I believe in there's a world down under
There's no wall for emotions now for me
Insanity all day long
Had to live in the presence not in the past
At least that part will last
All I need is love but love's not easy to find
I believe in there's a world down under
I have been there in a world down under
To be seen as a person when you play
All I need is love but love's not easy to find
All in all I'm saying all the time to all
I believe in there's a world down under
I have been there in a world down under
I believe in there's a world down under
I have been there in a world down under
I have been there in a world down under
I have been there in a world down under
I wanna kiss you just not ordinary miss you
I would like to do the same tomorrow
I wanna kiss you just not ordinary miss you
But you're sleeping on my arm
I am longing to wake you up
I have traveled around the world
I can never see myself in the rain
And we take it from here to now
I wanna kiss you just not ordinary miss you
I would like to do the same tomorrow
To something so obvious to myself
I'm wanting you day and night
When you're waking up here beside me
And your hair's a mess and I can't resist you
How will I do to protect our little world
I wanna kiss you just not ordinary miss you
I can never see myself in the rain
I wanna kiss you just not ordinary miss you
Here I go out to sea again
The sunshine fills my hair
And dreams hang in the air
Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes
You know it feels unfair
There's magic everywhere
Look at me standing here
Up straight in the sunshine
No need to run and hide
No need to laugh and cry
They seem to hate you
Because you are there
I stand here on my own
Look at me standing here
I'm here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine yeah
No need to run and hide
No need to laugh and cry
Look at me standing here
I'm here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine yeah
No need to run and hide
No need to laugh and cry
No need to run and hide
No need to laugh and cry
I just wanna have what is mine
I'm not trying to seduce you
For when it's long and cold at night
I would never try to change you
I wanna see who you are inside
Show me love and how to share it
I'll give you double love in return
Life is now and meant for living
Life will never ever be bad under my spell
I feel lonely when I see you
You'd make my day in many ways
Just a fragment of your lifetime
Show me love and how to share it
I'll give you double love in return
Life is now and meant for living
But I can give you something
No one's gonna give you
Show me love and live on learning
Life will never ever be bad under my spell
For a love like blood in me
A love like blood that never dies
Thinking about our story
Gotta come to my heart
That the love like blood in me
A love like blood that never dies
Thinking about our story
Gotta come to my heart
I stand in the line and do what I'm told
A love like blood that never dies
Thinking about our story
You're the code to my heart
Thinking about our story
You're the code to my heart
Change with the light
I'll be changed with the light
Shake it right in the night
Morning has come as the sun catches my face
I Realize that I'm alone with myself
In this light I am complete another me
Change with the light
I'll be changed with the light
Shake it right in the night
Rocking to the beat while you're shaking my mind
All the choices that the daylight brings
I'll be changed with the light
Shake it right in the night
Change with the light
I'll be changed with the light
Shake it right in the night
Change with the light
Tell me what the daylight brings
Oh change with the light
Change with the light
Tell me what the daylight brings
Have to tell you today
You better believe in angels
There's no other substitute
We all do that before we're going up in the sky
If your loving is in your money
No they cannot hug you back
This is the sound of the world
But all I see is that you twist and curl
You're blaming it all on doubt
You must blame it on yourself
You're burning your candle both ways
That I learned from my past
There's no point in being stressed
That is the thing I have learned
But all I see is that you twist and curl
I'm never gonna change my mind
No I'm never gonna change my mind
The juvenile in a time where the night is so cold
The juvenile has the key to the end
The world will take us to the end
Tomorrow's foe is now a friend
They cannot rise their voice yet
But later they will do
The juvenile in a time where the night is so cold
The world will take us to the end
Tomorrow's foe is now a friend
All come down and guide us
Before it is too late...
The juvenile in a time where the night is so cold
The world will take us to the end
Tomorrow's foe is now a friend
Always and always and always believe in
The juvenile in a time where the night is so cold
The world will take us to the end
Doing what you're doing
I've got someone who only loves me
I've got someone who'll always love me
It is you and me against the world
If someone's trying to hurt you baby
I will do my best to save us
What is good for you is good for me
Don't don't stop in the name of twosome
Keep on doing what you're doing
Baby it ain't over till it's over
Doing what you're doing
Doing what you're doing
Precious little diamond always
You remember I'd go where you'd go
Even if you don't fit in good
Don't don't stop in the name of twosome
Keep on doing what you're doing
Baby it ain't over till it's over
Doing what you're doing
Doing what you're doing
You gave my day a tone
I can't tell you the shape of it
You gave my day a tone
I can't tell you the shape of it
I will always follow where you go
Baby it ain't over till it's over
Doing what you're doing
Doing what you're doing
Doing what you're doing
Doing what you're doing
Who was the man behind the mask
Exploring your secrets is no easy task
You told me the secrets of living large
And how to behave with my friend in the dark
How I'm longing for you to give
Me some magic for us to live
If you told me it could be done
It was just you and me
I was lost in another way
A teardrop of rain is where you are
My perfect and gentle star of the stars
How I'm longing for you to give
Me some magic for us to live
If you told me it could be done
It was just you and me
I was lost in another way
I just want to find a way
That's the way it ought to be
I was lost in another way
I tried to write you a love song I thought I could
It used to be so good
What went wrong with us
You gave me a painting made of us
So I cherish our moments when we still were young
Can't you see I'm not strong enough
I'm doing it all for you
I'm doing it all for you
Hand in hand on our journey we're set for love
Can't you see I'm not strong enough
I'm doing it all for you
I'm doing it all for you
I'm doing it all for you
When I am singing the blues for you
Just one more chance to hear my prayer
I'm doing it all for you
I'm doing it all for you
I'm doing it All for you
I'm doing it All for you
I see us walking in the sand
That's when we said our first hello
Two perfect strangers hand in hand
I've had enough of broken dreams
Give me some music I can listen to
I've been Waiting for our song to play
I'm waiting for our song to play
I'd like you to take me back to last Summer
So far away from where we are
Our tropic night will last forever
Give me some music I can listen to
I've been Waiting for our song to play
I'm waiting for our song to play
I see us walking in the sand
That's when we said our first hello
Two perfect strangers hand in hand
Like Maria's love for Antony I felt
Such a West Side Story scene
You lock me up with your love
Now we're partners in crime
And your cronies do your thing
Listen to your heart and follow me
Listen to your heart and follow me
Never felt like this before
You've gotta be my fallen angel
It's the golden ratio
Took a bit out of time
Understand but can't forget
Now I'm drawn to you like the desert to rain
Listen to your heart and follow me
Listen to your heart and follow me
Never felt like this before
You've gotta be my fallen angel
It's the golden ratio
I turn like the flowers
Turning to the burning sun and the giving ground
They don't understand us
Never felt like this before...
Never felt like this before
You've gotta be my fallen angel
All my life I been searching
All my life I been searching
All my life I been searching
Sunset in Southern California
And the morning seems so far so far away
Sunset in Southern California
In the distance there's the light of San Diego
I came to his temple at noon the second day
All my life I been searching
All my life I been searching
An authoritarian bloke
He turned around and talked to me
With a demagogic voice
All my life I been searching
All my life I been searching
Where the roads are curved and dusty with no names
With a tempo I can share
Black sea for you and me
You're my Swedish complete taboo
I hear waves are roaring in
Birds are crying loud
I'm standing here so proud
I'm a sinner with a broken heart
Joy until the morning do us apart
That's what it takes for you to love me
And again and again that melody
All forgotten with the break of dawn
But our story lingers on
I'm leaving with my passion full withdrawn
With your essence already gone
That's what it takes for you to love me
And again and again that melody
Tired of this Bodegas
Some say I'm a rambler
That's what it takes for you to love me
And again and again that melody
That's what it takes for you to love me
And again and again that melody
A girl you never should have met
She acted like she's never seen your face before
It's not funny honey when you try
And she's not even willing to learn
It's not funny honey when you're only after money
What's up a bright and clear new summer day
Wake up and breath the air and sail away
How could she ever you forget
She acted like she's never seen your face before
It's not funny honey when you try
And she's not even willing to learn
It's not funny honey when you're on your own
And the pages never turn
What's up a bright and clear new summer day
Wake up and breath the air and sail away
Never meant to hurt you
But that's just the way it went
It's not my intention
Pretending to be Heaven Saint
What's up a bright and clear new summer day
Wake up and breath the air and sail away
I say love is precious when it dies
You follow him precise
I say love is precious when it dies
It's a moment passing by
That's why you're so believing
Taste that bitter sweet surprise
Appreciate your heart and your soul has been revised
I say love is precious when it dies
You follow him precise
I say love is precious when it dies
It's a moment passing by
That's why you're so believing
Taste that bitter sweet surprise
Appreciate your heart and your soul has been revised
I say love is precious when it dies
You follow him precise
I say love is precious when it dies
It's a moment passing by
That's why you're so believing
I say love is precious when it dies
You follow him precise
I say love is precious when it dies
It's a moment passing by
That's why you're so believing
Take us with us a common ground
Someone in this room is the right one for me
But how can it be that I cannot see
I'm showing off my liberty
But when the night time is all over I'm all alone
I'm advancing and I'm dancing with myself
I see you dancing in front of my face
Your body is moving to the trace of the chase
Losing the rhythm that's my goodbye
But when the night time is all over I'm all alone
I'm advancing and I'm dancing with myself
I see you dancing in front of my face
Your body is moving to the trace of the chase
I see you dancing in front of my face
Your body is moving to the trace of the chase
I was there to provide when you went through the struggle and strife
But there's too much competition for me
You're not on television
This bird has flown away
Let me know if your love is fading
I was there to provide when you went through the struggle and strife
But there's too much competition for me
You're not on television
This bird has flown away
We will never stay together
But there's too much competition for me
You're not on television
But there's too much competition
I was born in the shadows
Under the Iberian sun
I was the dawn of the valley
Under the Iberian sun
I really liked to rumble and hustle a lot
But where is the key monster
I am just a gatekeeper
And who do I want to be
And who do I want to be
I went down to the river
Trying to find peace in my mind
The desire for you made me blind
I first saw you at the distance
When the moon's at its height
I came to get to know you
A disclosure so bright
When your flair made me swoon
We met by chance here in Central Park
But where I can't remember
Give me peace at heart
With you the colors had a brighter shade
The sky was bluer and I was smiling
Now I'm stuck in an eternal fall
But I do recall your flavors
Give me peace at heart
But where do you turn to
When your answers long gone
I turn to the sunrise
With you the colors had a brighter shade
The sky was bluer and I was smiling
Now I'm stuck in an eternal fall
But I do recall your flavors
We took in the sights at the great museum
We kissed in the garden next to our Notre Dame
Just seconds to go to the new millennium
Got something now to live for
And down at the river we fell deep in love
We turned out this night Now it's ours forever
Now we've got something to die for
Into the night of blue
Into the night of blue
I haven't heard your voice for a long long time
Still you have me hanging on the line
Haven't seen a smile upon my face
And I haven't slept a night for days
Into the night of blue
Life is empty and sad without you
Into the night of blue
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Life is empty and sad without you
In my mind are pictures of our past
Days out on the beach out in the sun
Night when I was still your only one
Into the night of blue...
Funny how these memories only lead me back to you
They lead me back to you
Into the night of blue
Into the night of blue
Haven't heard your voice for a long long time
Life is empty and sad without you
Life is empty and sad without you
Into the night of blue
Into the night of blue
If you walk in the red light at night
In the black velvet hour
If you look you will see their delight
They're the purest of flowers
They've got love for sale
The money they earn when everybody wants them
They've got love for sale
What they get is addicted to drugs
To ease all their sorrows
What they get is addicted to drugs
To ease all their sorrows
They've got love for sale
The money they earn when everybody wants them
They've got love for sale
Illusions for your mind
They are just illusions for your mind...
The money they earn when everybody wants them
They've got love for sale
The man in the moon has a thousand different faces
The big and the small
You've gotta have pity on me
Wanna be free and happy
You've gotta have pity on me
Wanna be free and happy
I don't wanna be just one in many faces
I want you looking at me
Sit down and take a look
Give me something to believe
You've gotta have pity on me
You've gotta have pity on me
You've gotta have pity on me
You've gotta have pity on me
He's handsome and he knows how to use it
Like a catcher in the rye he nags till you die
His flatter makes you fall
But don't expect to have a ball
Baby I've tried him out
Baby I've tried him out
On the beach you'll see him showing off badly
With a golden look he conquers your best friend
And she has to say yes to her new excess
Baby I've tried him out
Baby I've tried him out
Baby I've tried him out
Baby I've tried him out
Baby I've tried him out
We're gonna make you move
We're gonna make you move
Each citizen's city life
What you gonna tell your dad
It's like a wheel of fortune
What you gonna tell your dad
What you gonna tell your dad
Each citizen's city life
What you gonna tell your dad
It's like a wheel of fortune
What you gonna tell your dad
What you gonna tell your dad
Tastes like steel like a stab from a knife
What you gonna tell your dad
It's like a wheel of fortune
What you gonna tell your dad
Everybody let me seek the town
What you gonna tell your dad
Everybody let me seek the town
What you gonna tell your dad
She leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
And the day had just begun
It's a day for catching tan
Just laying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
So if you are in sight and the day is right
The gentle voice that talks to you
It is a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
She's going to get you
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
Is there something about you
More than a thousand times
She's got to be the queen of angels above
She's got to be a true angel of love
You say you're looking for someone
From a cover of a magazine
But it isn't always what it seems
She's got to be the queen of angels above
She's got to be a true angel of love
She's got to be the queen of angels above
She's got to be a true angel of love
Never thought I'd see the day
Never thought I'd see the day love come your way
Never thought I'd see the day
Never thought I'd see the day love come your way
She's got to be the queen of angels above
She's got to be a true angel of love
Never thought I'd see the day
I am as young as I'm feeling
I need somebody to stay beside me
Baby with or without love
I'm gonna get a Man who can fulfill my dreams
On the top of the world I don't wanna be alone
Does she kiss you the way
That I used to kiss you
Love will come to you
But I will fight it till the end
There's a man for me to have and to hold
Easy come and easy go
Once bitten but not for long
And as young as I'm feeling
Love will come to you
You're looking through my face
Why don't you notice me
People are passing by
Come in the nights to come
You are my date but you don't know it
Me and myself and I are going to get you
I can see the shades of life
With you I'm feeling free
I can see the shades of life
With you I'm feeling free
And I'm gonna give a lot my baby
I'm giving you my love
I'm giving you my love
Standing here all alone
Going through all our levels now
I'm changing the highest one
Commitments to follow
I can see the shades of life
With you I'm feeling free
I can see the shades of life
With you I'm feeling free
I'm a stranger in the night
Without you all alone
I'm dancing with myself
It's a long way yet to go
I'm longing for your touch
To hold you forever on
I can see the shades of life
With you I'm feeling free
I can see the shades of life
With you I'm feeling free
I can see the shades of life
With you I'm feeling free
I can see the shades of life
There's a place in the Caribbean sun
Checking for the coast
And Molasses in the bar
I see the rise and the fall
Give me someone to dance with and love
When the sun goes down
While Fidel is growing his beard
Have a rally for consumers
It's so happy and poor
Little country down in the south
It's so happy and poor
Little country down in the south
There's a place in the Caribbean sun
The world is coming over to ya
Rest in peace but still he rock
When you're a bad boy haters don't wanna see you shine
So much pressure in this life of mine
I think I did it for maintain
Experience pearls of Experience
Let me turn all the tears
That you have cried into pearls
I'm gonna keep them for you
I want to mend what is broken
Love me the way that you loved her
And so I made up my mind
I'm gonna give all I've got
And get your love in return
And so I made up my mind
I'm gonna teach you to trust
And learn how to burn
And get your love in return
Sand strikes up in your eyes
I will cover your face
I'll plant your desert with roses
I will trying turn them to pearls
And so I made up my mind
I'm gonna be yours this time
I'm gonna give all I've got
And get your love in return
Experience pearls of Experience
And so I made up my mind
I'm gonna teach you to trust
And learn how to burn
Experience pearls of Experience
I'll wear your pearls more precious than silver
I'll wear your pearls so close to my skin
I'd tear myself apart just to get you
When you pearls are made
And so I made up my mind
I'm gonna be yours this time
I'm gonna give all I've got
And get your love in return
And so I made up my mind
I'm gonna be yours this time

And get your love in return
Experience pearls of Experience
Experience pearls of Experience
And so I made up my mind
I'm gonna be yours this time
I'm gonna give all I've got
And get your love in return
And so I made up my mind
I'm gonna be yours this time
Have to tell you today
You'd better believe in angels
There's no other substitute
We all do that before we're going up in the sky
Know they cannot hug you back
This is the sound of the world
You're going to be burned out and
You must blame it on yourself
You're burning your candle both ways
That I learned from my past
There's no point in being stressed
That is the thing I have learned
I'm never gonna change my mind
Have to tell you today
You can do what you want just seize the day
What you're doing tomorrow's gonna come your way
I just wanna be here beside you
And stay until the break of dawn
Take a walk in the park when you feel down
There's so many things there that's gonna lift you up
See the nature in bloom a laughing child
I just wanna be here beside you
I just wanna be here beside you
And stay until the break of dawn
You're looking for somewhere to belong
You're standing all alone
For someone to guide you on your way
I just wanna be anybody
I'm gonna take you to a place I've never been
I'm gonna take you in my arms and fly away with you tonight
It's a beautiful life
In a time where the night is so cold
Has the key to the end
The juvenile in the end
That is why we are here
The road will take us to the end
Tomorrow's foe is now a friend
Like they used to do it all so long ago
Either but the youth or but the old
They cannot rise their voices yet
But later on they will do
In a time where the night is so cold
The juvenile in the end
That is why we are here
The road will take us to the end
Tomorrow's foe is now a friend
We don't need no education
Telling us the right to choose
Any day will burst into a fire
Before it is too late
In a time where the night is so cold
The juvenile in the end
That is why we are here
The road will take us to the end
Tomorrow's foe is now a friend
Always and always and always believe in
In a time where the night is so cold
The juvenile in the end
That is why we are here
The road will take us to the end
People come and people go
What does it really matter
Make changes day to day
One day up and one day down
Let's call it fashion
Clear your mind if you wanna be free
Now they don't bother me
As long as there's no ration
To all the love I'm giving
You don't have a second left to hesitate
Nothing you can do will ever break the fall
Clear your mind if you wanna be free
Clear your mind if you wanna be free
They're looking at me
They're looking at me
Your mama's dressed up in expensive rags
Let's set the world on fire tonight
Let's set the light of lace
Let's set the world on fire tonight
You will remember my name
Some might say we ain't got no class
We're taking on the night yeah we're taking it back
Let's set the world on fire tonight
Let's set the light of lace
Let's set the world on fire tonight
You will remember my name
Let's set the world on fire tonight
Let's set the light of lace
Let's set the world on fire tonight
You will remember my name
When I'm dressed to kill I know
Some girls like their animals on their bed
But I prefer them in the wild instead
When times get dark I'm on my hunt again
To calm the beast that's raging in my head
We're all a bit wounded
We're all a bit wounded
It's a heart for rent in the shittiest place in town
That's how I get down
That's how I get down
It's a heart for rent in the shittiest place in town
That's how I get down
That's how I get down
Some say all things heal just give it time
But I prefer to heal in a different style
A nameless face that won't remember mine
I'll open up my heart for a little while
We're all a bit wounded
We're all a bit wounded
It's a heart for rent in the shittiest place in town
That's how I get down
That's how I get down
It's a heart for rent in the shittiest place in town
That's how I get down
That's how I get down
It's a heart for rent
It's a heart for rent in the shittiest place in town
That's how I get down
That's how I get down
It's a heart for rent in the shittiest place in town
That's how I get down
That's how I get down
With my heart fort rent
And you know don't even like the nine to five
I wish all those lazy days were everyday
And you know wouldn't want it any other way
Although some might say
I just ain't got time to save
Don't believe no pain no gain
I wanna make money while I sleep
I wanna make money while I dream
I wanna make money while I sleep
I wanna make money while I dream
Although some might say
I just ain't got time to save
Don't believe no pain no gain
I wanna make money while I sleep
I wanna make money while I dream
I wanna make money while I sleep
I wanna make money while I dream
I wanna make money while I sleep
I wanna make money while I dream
I wanna make money while I sleep
I am the force of an earthquake child
Light up the match I'm the gasoline
Out with the old and in with the new
I am the master of the seven seas
Known by all to bring men to their knees
My mind bending gravity is nature's worst
Out with the old and in with the new
Cover the night sky stars bound to fall
Cover the night sky stars bound to fall
Out with the old and in with the new
Out with the old and in with the new
All hail the queen as we're coming through
And I never ever get where I go
And as of now I think I've got no job
I'm so connected but I've got no friends
Just when you think it can get any worse
Dressed as a clown you show up drunk and high
Just hurry up and wait
Don't worry it's alright
Don't worry it's alright
Don't worry it's alright
Don't worry it's alright
Don't worry it's alright
Don't worry it's alright
And I might get way too frisky tonight
Cause no one ever takes me seriously
Just when you think it can get any worse
Dressed as a clown you show up drunk and high
Just hurry up and wait
Don't worry it's alright
Don't worry it's alright
Don't worry it's alright
Don't worry it's alright
Don't worry it's alright
Don't worry it's alright
Don't worry it's okay
Just hurry up and wait
Don't worry it's alright
Don't worry it's alright
Don't worry it's alright
Don't worry it's alright
Don't worry it's alright
Don't worry it's alright
I don't like that you might end up leaving
I'll be the first to go
I love to see you cry
I love you see you cry
Don't care about anybody else
Don't care about anybody else
Don't care about anybody
I don't care about anybody else
I regret it the moment I said it
I can't count all the hearts that I've broken
I saw the first to go
I love to see you cry
I love you see you cry
Don't care about anybody else
Don't care about anybody else
Don't care about anybody
I don't care about anybody else
But I'm much better on my own
It's so hard being this selfish
But I'm much better on my own
It's so hard being this selfish
Don't care about anybody else
Don't care about anybody else
Don't care about anybody
I don't care about anybody else
Don't care about anybody
My hands are shaking and it's close to obsession.
You think the pain by now would make me learn my lesson.
But there's no way to win when I push you away...
But I'd do anything if you asked me to stay.
I feel like I can fly then you cut down the wire.
Can't change the fact that I'm a slave to your power.
And you tighten the chains when I try to break free...
Keep me alive just to watch me bleed.
I crawl down on my knees for you.
Your love's the drug I can never quit.
But I'd do anything if you asked me to stay.
You've got to let it go
You say you know more then you want to know
The way she put it down was not for your eyes
It was just another letter after all you should know better
You've got to let it slide I just want to love you
Think it's time you finally realize
She only wants to get between you and me
Don't say it's too late to set the record straight
Your misconception plays
You let her words just take us separate ways
She's just somebody trying to get you with her lies
It's just another letter you should know better
You're still my everything
She made up this one sided rendezvous
I'm sorry it had to come back to you
The flowers the pictures I can't explain
Twisted as the tides.
Playing with your mind.
Standing in the rain.
Thorns come with the roses
And I will bring you pain.
It's better if you know
I'll break your heart
I told you that mines
Midnight conversations
Screaming out my name.
You'll have me to blame.
It's better if you know
I'll break your heart a thousand times.
I told you that mines
I'll break your heart a thousand times.
I told you that mines
I told you it's a hard hand to hold.
When the walls are closing in on me
And I can't find my way out
When I've seen as much as I can see
I just turn my eyes to you and I know that I'll get through it
And when I'm hanging by a thread
And when I'm sure I've reached the end
When I lose faith when I lose ground
When everything all comes crashing down
You raise me up you lift me up you give me love
When I'm out standing on the ledge
You take me in with just a look with just a touch
You redeem me with your love
When it seems this life has stole my soul
You're there to bring it back
When the hurt holds on and won't let go
And it's just too much to take I know you'll be there to save me
And when I'm sinking like a stone
Thinking I'm in this all alone
When I lose faith when I lose ground
When everything all comes crashing down
You raise me up you lift me up you give me love
When I'm out standing on the ledge
You take me in with just a look with just a touch
You redeem me with your love
I lose track and you bring me back around
Without you there's no way I'd be standing here right now
You look in my eyes you set me free
When I lose faith when I lose ground
When everything all comes crashing down
You raise me up you lift me up you give me love
When I'm out standing on the ledge
You take me in with just a look with just a touch
Once upon a summer night
We made love a thousand times
And I thought it'd never end
It's a shame that you and I
All we ever do is fight
About stupid little things
That we don't remember why
Before you pack that bag and leave
You know you gotta tell me
You're not the only one going through this
When love's a suicide
But there's something you should know
This is bigger than us both
We can scream and shout or we can work this out
You're not the only one going through this
Before you pack that bag and leave
You're not the only one going through this
You're not the only one going through this
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock
She got the good good
She Michael Jackson bad
But her attractive ass
I knock her lights out
But I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth
Cold as a winter's day
Steal your heart with ease
I like the way you walk it
With all kinds of space
I'll let you be the judge
Wanna spend it all on you baby
I can make your bedrock
Maybe it's time to put this pussy on your sideburns
We on my peddled bike
He say Nicki don't stop
I Love your sushi rolls
But I can meet you in the lobby
Girl I gotta watch my back
I've seen them standing in line
Just to get beside her
And let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear
I thought I recognized her
Wanna spend it all on you baby
I can make your bedrock
She said I'm caged in
I think her conscience is
But when that show ends
She poses like it's for posters
And I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you are for me
She said don't you ever show this
I'm to loyal and to focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this she rejoiced it
She said your words give me open
How I see it is how I call it
And I ain't even fast
I'm gonna stay a while
I'm gonna take a gander
Wanna spend it all on you baby
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock
When I heard your voice above all the noise
I felt so out of place
It was make or break why did I hesitate
I didn't know just what to do
I didn't even know your name
Why did I look you in the eyes
And now ill never be the same
It was an ordinary day
Was it my loneliness inside
That put you deep into my mind
It was the month of may
It's been a year today
Since you ran off with my life
I've got so much more to say
Keeping me waiting in the dead of the night
Your dirty mind is taking a hold of me
Your dirty mind is making a mess of me
Lost in the games you play
Look what you've done to me
I feel like a loaded gun
Your kiss is killing me slow your teeth are ripping my clothes
Your body's jumping on my bones for a ride
The way you're snapping those hips
Just like you're cracking the whip
Your dirty mind is taking a hold of me
Your dirty mind is making a mess of me
Lost in the games you play
Keeping me waiting in the dead of the night
Girl you always want it your way
Your dirty mind is taking a hold of me
Your dirty mind is making a mess of me
Lost in the games you play
I didn't know which way to go
You came into my empty life
Erased the pain and gave me hope
Just one look into your eyes opened the world to me
Took a lonely man right by the hand into the light
Baby your love is all I need
Girl you mean everything to me
I've got to let you know
Baby your love made me believe
You saw the good I had in me
You're the air I breathe
Girl I'm grateful for the gift of your love
Girl I live for your love
I thank you for the gift of your love
By the gift of your love
You bring me back to what is real
You tell my heart how you feel
And the answer to the prayer that I've been waiting for
Baby your love is all I need
Girl you mean everything to me
I've got to let you know
Baby your love made me believe
You saw the good I had in me
You're the air I breathe
Girl I'm grateful for the gift of your love
Girl I live for your love
I thank you for the gift of your love
By the gift of your love
You brought my heart to life
Girl I couldn't find a sign
Now you're my highest high
With you I touch the sky
I'm so thankful that you're mine
Took a lonely man right by the hand into the light
Baby your love is all I need
Girl you mean everything to me
I've got to let you know
Baby your love made me believe
You saw the good I had in me
You're the air I breathe
Girl I'm grateful for the gift of your love
Girl I live for your love
I thank you for the gift of your love
By the gift of your love
It's all about your love
It's all about your love
Oh baby you give me butterflies
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Since the return from her stay on the moon
But tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the milky way to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking at yourself out there
I will be the one who loves you
Something sacred in your eyes
Sometimes I think that you'll never understand me
I will be the one who loves you
Playing with your mind
Thorns come with the roses
And I will bring you pain
I'll break your heart
Midnight conversations
Take a lot of patience
Screaming out my name
You'll have me to blame
I'll break your heart
I told you it's a hard hand to hold
I'll break your heart
I'll make you cry now
I'll break your heart
The very first time that I saw your brown eyes
I knew right then you were the one
But to my satisfaction
Baby you were more than just a phase
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
I will be sure that the lady's just like you
The very next time she'll be my friend
If I say that I could be your one and only
I just wanna be the one you need
I just wanna be the one to serve you
Sometimes I feel as if I don't deserve you
I cherish every moment that we share
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
I will be sure that the lady's just like you
I need someone who who will be my friend
To be with me through thick and thin
Please share my love with me my friend
I need someone like you
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
I never know what the future brings
But I know you are here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
And though I can't be with you tonight
To know my heart is by your side
In the still of the night
In the still of the night
The stars were bright above
I'll hope and I'll pray
To keep your precious love
Well before the light
With all of your might
In the still of the night
Who ever told you I was letting go
Of the only joy that I have ever known
And all of the people that we used to know
Alone in this house again tonight
There's pictures of you and I on the walls around me
The way that it was and could have been surrounds me
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To Hell with my pride let it fall like rain
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To Hell with my pride let it fall like rain
Buddy you're a boy make a big noise
You got mud on your face
We will we will rock you
We will we will rock you
Buddy you're a young man hard man
You got blood on your face
Buddy you're an old man poor man
You got mud on your face
Somebody better put you back in your place
We will we will rock you
You can see it in my eyes...
So moments in life are strange
I can see it in your eyes...
How can I hold you by my side...
Heaven above is calling your name today... ooh
Heaven above is calling your name
Heaven above is calling your name...
You can see it in my eyes...
So moments in life are strange
I can see it in your eyes...
How can I hold you by my side...

How high must we climb
What will it be this time
Just waiting for your call
How high must we climb
What will it be this time
Just waiting for your call
Nothing much to remember
You were not in sight
Change of the weather
It's all that we really want
I know you're close by
It's just what's required
It's all that we really want
It's all that we really want
It's what we really need
It's what we really need
Is what we really want
I don't know the reason
Lets just make a choice
Lets throw out the caution
Back through the fields
Like when we believed
Back through the fields
And was the spotlight
Leaving all we've been.
I guess there's a first time for everything
And was the spotlight
And was the spotlight
You found oh the limelight.
So they paved the road to providence
And lined up the memories
In reference to what was dead and gone
Then the band and the symphony
In sweet sounding harmony
Lay down their guns in disgust
For they knew their armies at last
So haven't we seen enough
Haven't we had our fun
So we harbor our hopes and fears
In houses and evergreens
Then the rhythm of tambourine
And drama of marching scene
Lay down their violence in trust
For they knew how much the cost
So haven't we seen enough
Haven't we had our fun
Watching on the TV screens
For when all is said and done and our aims run
And it would be fair to say
So move in right along
For you I wrote this song
So this fool will never be with you
For just when I thought that we could make it
Realty strikes me down
For I don't want tomorrow
Just give me some today
I'll be on first train back home to yesterday
Leave me where you will
Thank you for the castle
Thank you for all of the castles
Made of stone let us call our own
I can't see your train
Its only only in the horizon
Light the fire stoke the coal blow the whistler all aboard next stop forever always castle man
But I can't see the ocean world winds are blowing
And your commit your ship to see
Next stop forever always castle man
And through the crowded memories we next gave our heart and sea and though the road leads back to you castle man a friend in deed you always kept us inside
You are always forever always and in our song
Always forever you are always castle man
It's time for our flight
Through the Hourglass we slide
Searching for the moment to decide
So don't lose sight of me now
We're still able to shine
You rode from the stars
Straight from the heart
Through the Hourglass we slide
Searching for the moment to decide
I won't lose sight of you now
We'll go higher than we
We'll go higher than we
We'll go higher than we
Tomorrow will start again
You were not in sight
Change of the weather
Is all that we really want
No matter where the day goes
I know you're close by
Changes in the seasons
It's just what's required
Is all that we really want
Is all that we really want
Is what we really need
It's what we really need
Is what we really want
And I don't want anyone instead of ya
You're someone else's baby
I'm so sick of living for other people
Took meeting you to realize
Put your little hand in mine and
There had been many moons before I met ya
And I ain't going nowhere
And I'm inspired again
And I know in some ways we're kinda evil
Got my roots and you've got ties
But my heart's no stranger to upheaval
Put your little hand in mine and
I just wanna listen to music again
I'm so sick of living for other people
Took meeting you to realize
Put your little hand in mine and
I need to be entertained
Don't trip off the glitz that I'm gonna display
No escaping when I start
Once I'm in I own your heart
There's no way to ring the alarm
So hold on until it's over
Do you know what you got into
I'm here for your entertainment
I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
You thought an angel swept you off your feet
But I'm about to turn up the heat
I'm here for your entertainment
I'm the master of both
Let me into your soul
I'm gonna work it till you're totally blown
No escaping when I start
Once I'm in I own your heart
There's no way to ring the alarm
So hold on until it's over
I'm here for your entertainment
I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
You thought an angel swept you off your feet
But I'm about to turn up the heat
I'm here for your entertainment
I'm here for your entertainment
I'm here for your entertainment
I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
You thought an angel swept you off your feet
But I'm about to turn up the heat
There might have been a time when I would give myself away
Just keep coming around
I wouldn't even try but I think you could save my life
Just don't give up on me
I wanna start a revolution
A type of personal solution
We all have got our own pollution
It's all about the execution
You got something to say
Let the freedom begin
I wanna see you strut
Everybody's looking for some love
How to let it all hang out
Don't wanna be so low
We're a complicated nation
And now we're in a situation
And get yourself some validation
You have something to say
Let the freedom begin
I wanna see you strut
Everybody's looking for some love
How to let it all hang out
Don't wanna be so low
And let me see you strut
Everybody's looking for some love
How to let it all hang out
Don't wanna be so low
Your soul will be okay
When you've had enough
And you miss the touch
It's never how it seems
Take shelter and hide forever
Your soul will be okay
And you've had enough
But you miss the touch
And you've had enough
We are the sure fire winners winners winners winners
We're coming up like killing machines
Our big guns gonna shatter your scene
It's pandemonium on the floor
They wanna ride on the rocket ship
Ride around the moon for a velvet kiss
How far this bad wild child's gonna go
We are the sure fire winners
We are the sure fire winners
Bringing the heat and the word is out
Giving you something to shout about
Flick the switch and the missile will fire
I'm a heat seeker when I'm full of desire
We're all drawn to the heat of the flame
I was born with glitter on my face
My baby clothes made of leather and lace
And all the girls in the club wanna know
We are the sure fire winners
We are the sure fire winners
Bringing the heat and the word is out
Giving you something to shout about
Gonna take you to the top to the brink of what you believe
You'd better get out of the game it's never gonna be the same
We are the sure fire winners
We are the sure fire winners
Bringing the heat and the word is out
Giving you something to shout about
We are the sure fire winners
We are the sure fire winners
Bringing the heat and the word is out
Giving you something to shout about
Gonna take you to the top to the brink of what you believe
Gonna take you to the top to the brink of what you believe
When you're in my arms
I feel emptier inside
I never felt so satisfied
Everything falls into place but
I think I need a little more time
And yeah I know my life has changed but
Honestly I don't know if we'll survive
You are all I ever want
And when you're not around dear
Don't even notice that you're gone
We are barely hanging on
Everything falls into place but I
Think I need a little more time
And yeah I know my life has changed but
Honestly I don't know if we'll survive
It's a certain kind of convocation
It's a certain kind of convocation
Everything falls into place but I
Think I need a little more time
And yeah I know my life has changed but
Honestly I don't know if we'll survive
And I'm doing me up with a black color liner
All we need in this world is some love
There's a thin line between the dark side
It's a struggle gotta rumble
What they need in this world is some love
There's a thin line between the wild time
The flashing of the lights
It might feel so good
The flashing and the stage
It might get me alright
But it don't mean a thing tonight
That would be the only thing I'd ever need
It's a trip on a flip
And flash right through the scene
Breaking through the boundaries
They won't ever find me
We're gonna see where we can go
And you're the one I want to know
It's a trip on a flip
And flash right through the scene
Same old faces make me shudder
It's a trip on a flip
And flash right through the scene
It's a trip on a flip
And flash right through the scene
I'm sick of laying down alone
I got this fever that I can sweat out
I'm sick of laying down alone
I saw a picture of you
Hanging in an empty hallway
I heard a voice that I knew
And I couldn't walk away
It took me back to the end
Outside the rain is pouring down
There's not a drop that hits me
Scream at the sky but no sound
It's like I can't even feel
After the way you touched me
After the way you loved me
I can't turn this around
I keep running into walls
That I can't break down
With my eyes wide shut
Let me out of this dream
And all the places we used to know
They're always there to haunt me
I walk around and I feel
You're everything that I want
But you don't want me
I can't turn this around
I keep running into walls
That I can't break down
With my eyes wide shut
Let me out of this dream
Let me out of this dream
I can't turn this around
I keep running into walls
That I can't break down
With my eyes wide shut
Everything inside your circle starts to overflow
Take a step before you leap
You give back what you give away
So don't look back on yesterday
Don't be afraid of what's inside
Gonna tell ya you'll be alright
Anytime anybody pulls you down
Anytime anybody says you're not allowed
Just remember you are not alone
Of lies and contradictions that you live with every day
Think of what could be if you rewrite the role you play
Take a step before you leap
You give back what you give away
So don't look back on yesterday
Don't be afraid of what's inside
Gonna tell ya you'll be alright
Anytime anybody pulls you down
Anytime anybody says you're not allowed
Just remember you are not alone
Before you break you have to shed your armor
Take a trip and fall into the glitter
Tell a stranger that they're beautiful
So all you feel is love love
All you feel is love love
Don't be afraid of what's inside
Wanna tell you you'll be alright
Don't be afraid of what's inside
Gonna tell ya you'll be alright
Anytime anybody pulls you down
Anytime anybody says you're not allowed
Just remember you are not alone
Gonna tell ya you'll be alright
Just remember you are not alone
So imperfectly what you should be
I don't want you to go
Don't wanna see you back out in the cold
I know the battles of chasing the shadows of who you wanna be
So imperfectly what you should be
Let's enlighten the night
When you drop your guard
I know the battles of chasing the shadows of who you wanna be
So imperfectly what you should be
So imperfectly what you should be
It's late at night and I can't sleep
Missing you just runs too deep
Oh I can't breathe thinking of your smile
Every kiss I can't forget
This aching heart ain't broken yet
Oh God I wish I could make you see
So nothing can stop me from trying
Maybe it's time for miracles
Maybe it's time for miracles
No I ain't giving up on us
I just wanna be with you
When all I know is trapped inside your eyes
The future I cannot forget
This aching heart ain't broken yet
Oh God I wish I could make you see
So nothing can stop me from trying
Maybe it's time for miracles
Maybe it's time for miracles
No I ain't giving up on us
So can you feel me feel you...
You know it's time...
Maybe it's time for miracles
Maybe it's time for miracles
You know I ain't giving up on us
You know I ain't giving up on
You run away from everything that you fear
So afraid ya don't wanna be a part of it
You see the fake in everything that is real
We gonna find out what makes us right or wrong
I wanna see you touch you one on one
We've only just begun
We are the face of the new generation
We are the ones who have no reservations
Don't care if you understand
Don't care if you understand
Just take what you need
So why won't you take a look
We are the face of the new generation
We are the ones who have no reservations
Don't care if you understand
Don't care if you understand
There's you... there's me
Things ain't what they used to be
We are the face of the new generation
We are the ones who have no reservations
Don't care if you understand
Don't care if you understand
Step right up to the freaky intangible
Step right into your stripper shoes
Going down the rabbit hole
Get away from all we know
Come on and follow me
Going down the rabbit hole
With hoes and gigolos
Come on and follow me
See it happen all over town
Going down the rabbit hole
Get away from all we know
Come on and follow me
Going down the rabbit hole
With hoes and gigolos
Come on and follow me
What's down the rabbit hole
Going down the rabbit hole
Get away from all we know
Come on and follow me
Going down the rabbit hole
With hoes and gigolos
Come on and follow me
Every moment lasts forever when you feel you've lost your way
What if my chances are already gone
Started believing that I could be wrong
But you give me one good reason
To fight and never walk away
With every step you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
You'll make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
Just when you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you've almost gave up on your dreams
Then take it by the hand and show you that you can
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries
I fought to the limit to stand on the edge
What if today is as good as it gets
Don't know where the future's heading
I've jumped every bridge and I've heard every lie
I've risked being safe but I always knew why
With every step you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
You'll make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
Just when you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you've almost gave up on your dreams
Then take it by the hand and show you that you can
There are no boundaries
Above and beneath you
Break every rule cause there's nothing between you and your dreams
With every step you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries
With every step you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
You'll make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries
Moon shine on the bayou
Love shrine break the taboo
I wanna know what's in your potion
Bound by total devotion
You're the hunter and I'm your prey
Now I'm lost in a lover hangover
I try to leave but I have to stay
Swamp sings over the bazaar
Snake bites aligning stars
I'm in rapture there is no cure
No sanctuary from your allure
You're the hunter and I'm your prey
Now I'm lost in a love hangover
I try to leave but I have to stay
To make me into your fool
That pins keep pushing into
So every time I try to break this trance
I'm almost afraid I'll miss my chance
To be bewitched by the bayou
I just gotta say I want your hex
I don't want to live without your hex
I'm almost afraid I'll miss my chance
I don't want to live without your hex
Guess it was not meant to be
But it's not as bad as it seems
You saw the way that I fell
But I'm better off by myself
But it's not that easy for me to say goodbye
And everything in me wants you back in my life
It feels like the dawn of the dead
Nothing kills more than to know
That this is the end of the road
But it's not that easy for me to say goodbye
And everything in me wants you back in my life
Wish I could just find a way
To have all your memories erased
When I came across this sign
We don't like when visitors come
No trespassing that's what it said
At least that's what I could read
And that's when I could see
That the ether that I tapped into
Once I hit that mountain peak I began to lose my mind
Life's my light and liberty and I shine when I wanna shine
Make their faces crack
There's no turning back
When I came across this sign
We don't like when visitors come
No trespassing that's what it said
At least that's what I could read
That's the one thing you can believe
To show me where to go
But I can turn into the North Pole
And I'll show you what is cold
Life's my light and liberty and I shine when I wanna shine
There's no turning back
When I came across this sign
We don't like when visitors come
No trespassing that's what it said
At least that's what I could read
Life's my light and liberty and I shine when I wanna shine
When I came across this sign
We don't like when visitors come
No trespassing that's what it said
At least that's what I could read
Feel like I'm having a meltdown
It feels like I'm losing control
They tell me I'm a danger to myself
Now the crazy train is ready to roll
Walk that walk like you don't give a fuck
You've got a right to turn it up and down
I'm gonna lose my mind like a maniac
And we've gone cuckoo
Gonna party till they take us away
Now I'm swinging off of my hinges
I'm cocked and I'm ready to go
This crazy train is ready to roll
Walk that walk like you don't give a fuck
You've got a right to turn it up and down
I'm gonna lose my mind like a maniac
And we've gone cuckoo
Gonna party till they take us away
Gotta get out of this straight jacket
I've gotta get out of this straight jacket
I'm gonna lose my mind like a maniac
And we've gone cuckoo
Sorry I'm kinda drunk but
That satisfaction when i
Don't turn on the light
Freaks like us can meet
Gonna go and get me a shot
I'm feeling pretty fierce in my
That satisfaction when i
Don't turn on the light
Freaks like us can meet
I throw more shade than a cloudy day
All I wanna be is free
Freaks like us can meet
They say maybe it's just a phase
I wish that this night would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die
So let's just stay awake until we grow older
I don't wanna let a minute get away
None of us are promised to see tomorrow
And what we do is ours to choose
Forget about the sunrise
Fight the sleep in your eyes
I don't wanna miss a second with you
Let's stay this way forever
It's only getting better if we want it to
You know I wish that this night would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die
So let's just stay awake until we grow older
It's so hard to think this could fade away
But what goes up must come down
And always live in the now
Forget about the sunrise
Fight the sleep in your eyes
I don't wanna miss a second with you
Let's stay this way forever
It's only getting better if we want it to
You know I wish that this night would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die
So let's just stay awake until we grow older
You know I wish that this night would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die
So let's just stay awake until we grow older
She wants to be up there
In the air where the clouds live
The sweetest seeds make the best trees
30,000 feet she can smile and now
She puts the shot glass down
She ask for another round
She wants to hit the clouds
Honey are you up there now
She puts the shot glass down
She ask for another round
Girl don't you hit the ground
Honey are you up there
She wants to introduce me
He got words that rhyme
She puts the shot glass down
She ask for another round
She wants to hit the clouds
Honey are you up there now
She puts the shot glass down
She ask for another round
Girl don't you hit the ground
Honey are you up there
Oh whoa yeah yeah yeah
Oh whoa yeah yeah yeah
I know you're holding back
I want your naked love
You know your naked love
Is what I'm dreaming of tonight
Oh whoa yeah yeah yeah
Oh whoa yeah yeah yeah
I know you're holding back
I want your naked love
You know your naked love
Is what I'm dreaming of tonight
Oh whoa yeah yeah yeah
Tonight we burn it all
You got the key to your release
So pop that lock until you're lighter than air
If you wanna be that you've got to dream
If you got the key then baby pop that lock
If you wanna free it you have got to scream
If you got the key then baby pop that lock
Secret don't care if you don't keep it don't care if you leak it
Tonight we burn it all
You got the key to your release
So pop that lock until you're lighter than air
If you wanna be that you've got to dream
If you got the key then baby pop that lock
If you wanna free it you have got to scream
If you got the key then baby pop that lock
You better pop that lock
If you wanna be that you've got to dream
If you got the key then baby pop that lock
If you wanna free it you have got to scream
If you got the key then baby pop that lock
And more bitter than a December
That's how I treated you
I sometimes tend to lose my temper
Yeah that's the truth
I know it gets hard sometimes
But I really need you near me to
Keep my mind off the edge
But you're the only one that knows me
Better than I know myself
I tried to pretend it didn't matter
For even a day I wouldn't know which way to turn
I know it gets hard sometimes
But I really need you near me to
Keep my mind off the edge
But you're the only one that knows me
Better than I know myself
I can be obnoxious at times
But try and see my heart
You're the only thing in this world I would die without
But I really need you near me to
Keep my mind off the edge
If I wanted to leave I would have left by now
But you're the only one that knows me
Better than I know myself
But I really need you near me to
Keep my mind off the edge
But you're the only one that knows me
Tower of babel has fallen down again
I don't know who I should believe in
Everybody's an authority
Fragments don't count
They always end up falling through the cracks
Can't say all the little things
That I wanna tell you right now
I know you won't understand
But I gotta tell you somehow
Lost inside communication breakdown
Strip away the flesh and bone
Look beyond the lies you've known
Everybody wants to talk about a freak
No one wants to dig that deep
Let me take you underneath
Baby better watch you step
Never mind what's on the left
You're gonna see things you might not wanna see
It's still not that easy for me
A red river of screams
Stars in my black and blue sky
Welcome to my world of truth
I don't wanna hide any part of me from you
I'm standing here with no apologies
Such a beautiful release
A red river of screams
Stars in my black and blue sky
Strip away the flesh and bone
Look beyond the lies you've known
I'm standing here with no apologies
Such a beautiful release
Baby better watch your step
Never mind what's on the left
You're gonna see things you might not wanna see
It's still not that easy for me
A red river of screams
Stars in my black and blue eyes
The depths of my skin
A red river of screams
Stars in my black and blue sky
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Baby I can smell you on my clothes
I try to stay composed
But I feel the fever grow
I keep running away running away running away from you
But I can't stand breaking the chains
Breaking the chains breaking the chains
Bring it on back bring it on back bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
All these hard confessions I forgave
Baby I can smell you on my clothes
I try to stay composed
I keep running away running away running away from you
But I can't stand breaking the chains
Breaking the chains breaking the chains
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Now I'm bring you baby back to me
Gotta bring it on back bring it on back bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Everywhere we go we're looking for the sun
They've branded us enough Outlaws of Love.
Scars make us who we are
Everywhere we go we're looking for the sun
They've branded us enough Outlaws of Love.
Everywhere we go we're looking for the sun
They've branded us enough Outlaws of Love.
Steel to my trembling lips
Bottom of the bottle hits
Waking up my mind as I throw a fit
My heart's beating faster
I know what I'm after
I've been standing here my whole life
Everything I've seen twice
Now it's time I realized
It's spinning back around now
Now I can't seem to breathe right
Sick of being tired and sick
And ready for another kind of fix
My heart's beating faster
I know what I'm after
I've been standing here my whole life
Everything I've seen twice
Now it's time I realized
It's spinning back around now
Now I can't seem to breathe right
A life that's always been a dream
I've been standing here my whole life...
My heart's beating faster
I've been standing here my whole life
Everything I've seen twice
Now it's time I realized
It's spinning back around now
Now I can't seem to breathe right
We know how to talk it into the ground
We know how to wear it out
And I would give anything just to chase the dark away
And start all over again
It used to be we owned the night
All the stupid games we play
And I would give anything just to chase the dark away
And start all over again
We lost it we lost it
And I would give anything just to chase the dark away
And start all over again
When the stars are too cold
Frozen all over the globe
On the edge of the night
We can be their light.
So give me more than your touch
And give yourself to the rush
Just keep holding my hand
I know where we'll land
We can escape to a higher plane
Where the dreamers lay
Safe on a higher plane
Through the dark there's a way
Where we don't have to hide
We can dream all night.
So follow me through the sky
And watch the oceans collide
I know where we'll land
We can escape to a higher plane
Where the dreamers lay
Safe on a higher plane
We can escape to a higher plane
Where the dreamers lay
Safe on a higher plane
The dawn is bright and my perception is open wide
You know you flooded my senses babe
What you inspire is a feeling I can't describe
Forgotten all my defenses
You were a beam of light
There was just something about you
I had a visions and you painted the world for me
I don't need a wander anymore
I have found what I've been looking for
I don't need a map to know the way
I don't need a map to tell me where I'm at
Now I believe in more than I can see
Now I can breathe again
I don't need a map to know the way
I don't need a map you're always like a path
The dawn is bright and my perception is open wide
You know you flooded my senses babe
What you inspire is a feeling I can't describe
Forgotten all my defenses
You were a beam of light
There was just something about you
I had a visions and you painted the world for me
I don't need a wander anymore
I have found what I've been looking for
I don't need a map to know the way
I don't need a map to tell me where I'm at
Now I believe in more than I can see
Now I can breathe again
I don't need a map to know the way
Died last night in my dreams
Of some old ghost town
In God and James Dean
But Hollywood sold out
Saw all of the saints
Walked into the flames
But there was no answer
And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
Died last night in my dreams
Had been disconnected
Time was thrown at the wind
And all of my friends
And everyone's spread
And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
There's no one left in the world
Don't give a damn if I go
I got a voice in my head that keeps singing
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
Pushing 150 just to get a rise
There's no comfort in comfort I need the edge
But the edge keeps drifting it's all in my head
The medication flowing through my veins was you
Just let me feel the rush like the first night
Gotta feel the touch like the first time
Chasing the original high
I try to feed the hunger that keeps me up at night
The medication flowing through my veins was you
Just let me feel the rush like the first night
Gotta feel the touch like the first time
Chasing the original high
Summertime is stuck on my mind
Summertime is stuck on my mind
Chasing the original high... high... high... high... high...
Just let me feel the rush like the first night
Gotta feel the touch like the first time
Know I should let you go
But the world won't stop
I would do anything to have you by my side
Don't wanna throw away another lonely life
I would do anything to have you by my side
Don't wanna throw away another lonely life
I would do anything to have you by my side
Nobody kills me like you do
Nothing I take can ever cut through
I look at myself and I don't know
How I'm stuck to you like Velcro
Can't rip you off and go solo
I'm hooked on how you made
I want you to take me underground
I want you to take me underground
I'm hooked on how you made
I want you to take me underground
I want you to take me underground
Nobody kills me like you do
Nothing I take can ever cut through
I look at myself and I don't know
How I'm stuck to you like Velcro
Can't rip you off and go solo
I'm hooked on how you made
I want you to take me underground
I want you to take me underground
I'm hooked on how you made
I want you to take me underground
I want you to take me underground
You got me hooked on you
I'm hooked on how you made
I want you to take me underground
I want you to take me underground
I'm hooked on how you made
I want you to take me underground
And I can't see the truth in living
When we hide with a wall of fear
It's a twisted dream you believe in
Let's make the smoke and mirrors disappear
And I won't apologize to you anymore
And I won't live again
And I'm sick and tired of living in your shadows
And I won't apologize to you anymore
And I don't understand
Why I should be living in the shadows
And I can't see the truth in living
When we hide with a wall of fear
It's a twisted dream you believe in
Let's make the smoke and mirrors disappear
And I won't apologize to you anymore
And I won't live again
And I'm sick and tired of living in your shadows
And I won't apologize to you anymore
And I don't understand
Why I should be living in the shadows
You'll never believe what I heard on the wire
Feels like all the love is gone
We get stuck up inside our heads
Talk shit till we're walking dead
You'll never break my heart
We know what they don't know
Feels like all the love is gone
We get stuck up inside our heads
Talk shit till we're walking dead
You'll never break my heart
You'll never break my heart
My life flashed before my eyes
Razor blade lips and daggers up in your eyes
My life flashed before my eyes
You lit up like a full moon
You work it like there's no rules
Keep me on a leash tonight
There's nowhere for me to hide
See you on the other side
My life flashed before my eyes
Razor blade lips and daggers up in your eyes
My life flashed before my eyes
I can tell your heart's cold
Like a fallen angel walking in your sleep
I guess you're just a lost soul
Keep me on a leash tonight
There's nowhere for me to hide
See you on the other side
My life flashed before my eyes
Razor blade lips and daggers up in your eyes
My life flashed before my eyes
She's off to party with the diamond dogs
From the wrong side of the tracks
Her window's open anytime she's home
But now it's locked up at last
She was bound to break free from the start
Girl got that rebel heart
There ain't no stopping her now
She's off to sell herself in the seedy bar
The johns are loaded for love
Innocence under attack
She was bound to be stabbed in the back
All for some fun in the sack
Now she's alone and got no one to call
Maybe I played too safe
I'd been hoping you'd catch up somehow
Like I'm way too far ahead
Every time I think I'm gaining ground
I'm misunderstood again
I thought that I said it
In the things that I didn't say
I thought that you felt it
In the games that I didn't play
So let the record show
In the things that I didn't say
In the things that I didn't say
In the things that I didn't say
Thought it was going deep
Guess it was never enough
I'd been hoping you'd catch up somehow
Like I'm way too far ahead
Every time I think I'm gaining ground
I'm misunderstood again
I thought that I said it
In the things that I didn't say
I thought that you felt it
In the games that I didn't play
So let the record show
In the things that I didn't say
In the things that I didn't say
In the things that I didn't say
I thought that I said it
In the things that I didn't say
I thought that you felt it
In the games that I didn't play
So let the record show
In the things that I didn't say
In the things that I didn't say
I'm the rush of a bleeding heart
I'm the bruise of a rough start
I'm the dust that ignites the spark
They say that I'm blue like the night sky
I tried to blow my mind a million times
And it's burning still
And it's burning still
I am the fire and you are the rain
I am the fire and you are the rain
I am the fire and you are the rain
I am the fire and you are the rain
I'm a prisoner on the run
I am the moon that reflects the sun
They say that I knew that I'm never green
That I will rage against the machine
I am never something in between
And it's burning still
And it's burning still
I am the fire and you are the rain
I am the fire and you are the rain
I am the fire and you are the rain
I am the fire and you are the rain
I'll be trying too hard when I already lost
If I get a scent that's meant to trip my reason
I don't wanna get down in the flame
Just like a honest liar
I don't wanna melt down in the heat
Like I got the devil at my feet
Just like a funeral pyre
When I think about the doubt that I depend on
I don't wanna get down in the flame
Just like a honest liar
I don't wanna melt down in the heat
Like I got the devil at my feet
Just like a funeral pyre
Feel like an honest liar
Taking on a heavy fire
Just like an honest liar
I gotta get outside of my mind before I rip it out
I feel it at the wheel
I'm burning red lights
I feel it at the wheel
I feel it at the wheel
Before I get a chance to speak you're convinced I'm guilty
God knows I've been a very bad boy
You've been telling me
You've been telling me
But God knows I didn't break your toys
But you're blaming me
I feel thrown out the window
So search and destroy
You're too hard on your boy
You're too hard on your boy
But you got me whipped and chained when I don't deserve it
God knows I've been a very bad boy
You've been telling me
You've been telling me
But God knows I didn't break your toys
But you're blaming me
I feel thrown out the window
You don't have to be so
So search and destroy
You're too hard on your boy
You're too hard on your boy
You've got me ashamed
You've got me ashamed
I feel thrown out the window
So search and destroy
You're too hard on your boy
You've got me ashamed
Listen to the radio then I let it go
Listen to the radio then I let it go
Listen to the radio then I let it go
Listen to the radio then I let it go
These boys can't slow me down
Try to take deep breaths
So I don't lose my composure
Listen to the radio then I let it go
Friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
Well I move like a rat
Babe I'm gonna be your man
I said friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
Yeah I well I move like a rat
Babe I'm gonna be your man.
Friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
Well I move like a rat
Babe I'm gonna be your man
I was born by the river in a little tent
Oh and just like the river I've been running ever since
It's been too hard living but I'm afraid to die
I go to the movie and I go downtown somebody keep telling me don't hang around
Then I go to my brother
And I say brother help me please
Back down on my knees
There been times that I thought I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to carry on
They fall to earth alive
Desires that are burning
A deeper breath goes out
I'll make you beg for mercy
I'll make you beg for mercy
Come to settle the score
The lightning and the thunder
Taking shape won't hide
Enlightening you to wonder
Is racing towards the line
As every beat and sound
I'll make you beg for mercy
I'll make you beg for mercy
Come to settle the score
I've got it next to nothing
Come to settle the score
I'll make you beg for mercy
I'll make you beg for mercy
Come to settle the score
I'll make you beg for mercy
I'll make you beg for mercy
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
It don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
Either you're wrong or you're right
It don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Go when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
It don't matter if you're black or white
It don't matter if you're black or white
It don't matter if you're black or white
It's tough for you to get by
It's tough for you to get by
It's tough for you to get by
It's tough for you to get by
Get your motor running
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
In whatever comes our way
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
I like smoke and lightning
And the feeling that I'm under
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
Like a true nature child we were born to be wild
Get your motor running
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
In whatever comes our way
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
I can't find you in the smoke
The night is burning as we choke
Crawl through the fire
I can't find you in the smoke
The night is burning as we choke
Crawl through the fire
Crawl through the fire
When I was so broken hearted
Love wasn't much of a friend of mine
All I want is someone I can't resist
I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed
Between pleasure and pain
Must be one and the same
Yeah I got to tell you one thing
We're partners in crime
You got that certain something
Now the word out on the street
Is the devil's in your kiss
If our love goes up in flames
It's a fire I can't resist
Your love is sweet misery
Ain't where your love should stay
If you give your heart away
Your love is sweet misery
Your love is sweet misery
Say your prayers little one
Don't forget my son to include everyone
Keep you free from sin till the sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Heavy thoughts tonight and they aren't of Snow White
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Now I lay me down to sleep
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet and in your head
Dragonfly out in the sun
There's a new word for me
Stomping out all the rules of the game
Now you got the vision
We got each other and who cares who knows
They say that we are only
And they say we don't know who we are
They can't come between us
They'll never defeat us
We won't break so easily
Come out of the darkness
I know that you can find your way somehow
Trust your gonna find it
No one else can bring it like us
Rock and roll with the punches
They say that we are only
And they say we don't know who we are
They can't come between us
They'll never defeat us
We won't break so easily
Come out of the darkness
I know that you can find your way somehow
Trust your gonna find it
Come out of the darkness
I know that you can find your way somehow
Trust you're gonna find it
Fling your fever at the camera
Lose your mind on all my candy
Purple moons got us on fire
Throw it on words and this love
Fling your fever at the camera
Lose your mind on all my candy
Setting sunlight acts so kindly
Sleeping Keeping acts so blindly
Don't know why I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
My life would end and it doesn't matter how I cry
My tears of love are a waste of time
If I turn away am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
Can't let go and it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily to you my love
To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
They say I've got no right
To question life without hope
Or ask for anything more
Than to suffer and bleed at the end of a rope
They say I've got no right
To look them in the eye
That I belong in the dust at their feet
Does anybody out there
Is our future written
They teach us to believe we're not strong like them
That we don't have the will
To crush these walls that hold us in
They try and make us think that we'll never have a chance
Can I fight for my own freedom
Does anybody out there
Is our future written
You can tie a rock to my soul
You can chain my body
But still the spirit flies
Does anybody out there
Will our hopes die slowly
Letting go that we could share.
Connections like ours are not made to fade.
I thought I could find
Moving past these routine days.
Connections like ours are not made to fade.
Just the way it is now.
Just the way it is now.
I thought I could find
Moving past these routine days.
Are not made to fade.
Just the way it is now.
We know expectations.
Just the way it is now.
You tell me to make ya
Feel like you're in Heaven
You tell me you know what you want
You love that I'm open
I tell all my business
You know what you are getting when we
I've had lots of lovers
And everyone knows it
And I never said it to be mean
I just get so excited
We got into bed I'm not ashamed
Why can't we all be free
Why can't we all be proud
And shout it out loud
And I never said it to be mean
I just get so excited
We got into bed I'm not ashamed
I never felt so satisfied
Everything falls into place
But I think I need a little more time
But honestly I don't know if we'll survive
Don't even notice that you're gone
We are barely hanging on
Everything falls into place
But I think I need a little more time
But honestly I don't know if we'll survive
Makes me want you baby
It's a certain kind of complicated
It's a certain kind of complicated
Everything falls into place
But I think I need a little more time
But honestly I don't know if we'll survive
All around me are familiar faces
Bright and early for the daily races
And their tears are filling up their glasses
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
Children waiting for the day they feel good
And they Don't feel the way that every child should
Went to school and I was very nervous
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
It's early in the morning
And my heart is really moaning
And I don't know how to take it
But its driving me so crazy
I don't know if its right
And I still can't sleep
So helpless in my heart
I don't know what to do but to think of mi love
Its just an illusion that I have in my heart
I don't know what to do I'm going out of my mind
We could do this all night now I don't care if you got a man
And I still can't sleep
So helpless in my heart
I don't know what to do but to think of mi love
Its just an illusion that I have in my heart
I like the way you freak it like that
I like the way you freak it like that
I like the way you freak it like that
Got your boy feel less supreme
Hold up wait a minute baby you so damn independent
Loving everything your representing
And that's what's up and I don't care what people scream
I'm gonna keep it saucy
Its just an illusion that I have in my heart
Its just an illusion that I have in my heart
You got someone to blame
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without
To drag the past out into the light
Have you come here for forgiveness
Have you come to raise the dead
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head
When all you got is hurt
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music right
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
I tried to understand this
I thought that they were out of their minds
Losing every step of the way
And check to see if things still the same
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music right
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
Play that funky music
Play that funky music
Play that funky music
Play that funky music
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music right
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by the wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
And the flames went up higher
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
I fell into burning ring of fire
And the flames went up higher
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by your wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
And the flames went higher
I fell into a burning ring of fire
And the flames got higher
You gotta give to get back
A shot of karma to throw back
You gotta give to get all you crave
Not preaching I just want to tell ya
Don't buy what the people will sell ya
Not preaching I just want to tell ya I'm made
Always gonna get off on pride
But I'm never gonna get off this ride
My daddy raised quite a sinner
Taught that the line was much thinner
You gotta count all the lions
While keeping track of the liars
Always gonna get off on pride
But I'm never gonna get off this ride
Always gonna get off on pride
But I'm never gonna get off this ride
Only before it's done
Suck on a smoking gun
Make like a hit and run
Only before it's done
Suck on a smoking gun
Make like a hit and run
Only before it's done
Suck on a smoking gun
Always gonna get off on pride
But I'm never gonna get off this ride
Always gonna get off on pride
But I'm never gonna get off this ride
Why can't everybody look
That'll make the world open up.
Then they really don't want them.
But we won't let that bring us down.
It won't bring us down.
It won't bring us down.
I would rather disappear than live in fear.
If they don't want us
Then we really don't want them.
But we won't let that bring us down.
It won't bring us down.
It won't bring us down.
It won't bring us down.
It won't bring us down.
It won't bring us down.
It won't bring us down.
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
And that man comes on the radio
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
And that man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts can be
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
Who tells me baby better come back later next week
I can't get no satisfaction
People say I'm the life of the party
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I am blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace the tracks of my tears
Since you left me if you see me with somebody else
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although they might be cute there's just no substitute
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace the tracks of my tears
Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Just a clown since you put me down
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile it looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace the tracks of my tears
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
I saw a picture of you
Hanging in an empty hallway
It sent me back to the end of everything
Outside the rain's pouring down
There's not a drop that hits me
Scream at the sky but no sound
It's like I can't even feel
After the way you've touched me
After the way you loved me
I can't turn this around
I keep running into walls that I can't break down
With my eyes wide shut because of you
I walk around and I feel so lost and lonely
You're everything that I want
But you don't want me
I can't turn this around
I keep running into walls that I can't break down
I say I just wander around
With my eyes wide shut because of you
I can't turn this around
I keep running into walls that I can't break down
I say I just wander around
With my eyes wide shut because of you
You know I have a veil
I'm happy to entertain and share with you
It's hard to say how your own thoughts can hurt you...
I'm gonna let them stare
They feel like me out there
So welcome to the show
Bring on all the lights
We're together here tonight
I know I have my flaws
I pay the price but I'm grateful
You're letting me be myself
I'm gonna let them stare
They feel like me out there
So welcome to the show
Bring on all the lights
We're together here tonight
Welcome to my life...
Welcome to my life...
I'm gonna let them stare
I'm gonna let them in
They feel like me out there
So welcome to the show
Bring on all the lights
We're together here tonight
I'm gonna give you my love.
Gonna give you my love.
We're coming up like killing machines
Our big guns gonna shatter your scene
It's pandemonium on the floor
They wanna ride on the rocket ship
Ride around the moon for a velvet kiss
How far this bad wild child's gonna go
We are the sure fire winners
We are the sure fire winners
Bringing the heat and the word is out
Giving you something to shout about
Flick the switch and the missile will fire
I'm a heat seeker when I'm full of desire
We're all drawn to the heat of the flame
I was born with glitter on my face
My baby clothes made of leather and lace
And all the girls in the club wanna know
We are the sure fire winners
We are the sure fire winners
Bringing the heat and the word is out
Giving you something to shout about
Gonna take you to the top to the brink of what you believe
You'd better get out of the game it's never gonna be the same
We are the sure fire winners
We are the sure fire winners
Bringing the heat and the word is out
Giving you something to shout about
We are the sure fire winners
We are the sure fire winners
Bringing the heat and the word is out
Giving you something to shout about
Gonna take you to the top to the brink of what you believe
Gonna take you to the top to the brink of what you believe
When you're not here minutes feel like days
And I wait to hold you in my arms
But I'm strong and I'll hold on
Open the doors feel the need in me
Babe your love is like oxygen through my veins
I feel my body shake and my heart's about to fail
A panic attack and I can't exhale
You're the life I believe you're the air that I need
When you touch me I breathe again
You're the life I believe you're the air that I need
When you touch me I breathe again
I want to wake lying next to you
Where I'm safe and far away from harm
Nothing takes my breathe away
Like the thought of you gone
You're the life I believe you're the air that I need
When you touch me I breathe again
You're the life I believe you're the air that I need
When you touch me I breathe again
I feel my body shake and my heart's about to fail
A panic attack and I can't exhale
You're the life I believe you're the air that I need
When you touch me I breathe again
You're the life I believe you're the air that I need
When you touch me I breathe again
You're the life I believe you're the air that I need
When you touch me I breathe again
You're the life I believe you're the air that I need
When you touch me I breathe again
You're everything my heart desires
Your love has no missing parts
It's everything my heart desires
There ain't no one better for me
I'm in love with you girl
Can't believe it's real
You're everything my heart desires
Your love has no missing parts
It's everything my heart desires
And then you appeared
I just can't believe that you're here
You're everything my heart desires
Your love has no missing parts
It's everything my heart desires
You're everything my heart desires
I love the way you are
You're everything my heart desires
You're everything my heart desires
Your love has no missing parts
Forever asking if I'm fine
I understand your worries
Because we're on each other's minds
Then I know you're coming home to me baby
Girl let me remind you of the good times
We're gonna party all night
Till the break of the light
Now is the time to celebrate our survival
And when we start to unwind
Making love's on my mind
Together we will celebrate our revival
All those weeks I never wondered
Too much love is on the line
And say your gonna stay with me baby
Girl let me remind you of the good times
We're gonna party all night
Till the break of the light
Now is the time to celebrate our survival
And when we start to unwind
Making love's on my mind
Together we will celebrate our revival
And say your gonna stay with me baby
Girl let me remind you of the good times
We're gonna party all night
Till the break of the light
Now is the time to celebrate our survival
And when we start to unwind
Making love's on my mind
I can't live without your love
I can't live without your love
If there's just one thing
I can't live without your love
I'm sorry for the things that I said
This is the time I know I'll regret
Every step I take is further from you
It's just another day
Oh you know it's true
I can't live without your love
I can't live without your love
If there's just one thing
I can't live without your love
I fool myself that I'm doing fine
But I know I'm just counting time
See the places we used to go
Talk to friends they seem to know
It's just another day
Oh you know it's true
I can't live without your love
I can't live without your love
If there's just one thing
I can't live without your love
If I could turn back the hands of time
I would keep the love I know to be mine
You know I would girl
You know I'm sorry about the things I said
I don't know what I was thinking
But if you give me just one more chance
To prove what I say is true
I can't live without your love
I can't live without your love
If there's just one thing
It's of you I'm dreaming
The touch I'm needing
You make me believe in love
It's your scent I'm breathing
Your beauty I'm seeing
It makes me believe in love
I almost gave up on my dreams
Wouldn't know what true love means
But it feels so different
For the first time I'm alive
It's of you I'm dreaming
The touch I'm needing
You make me believe in love
It's your scent I'm breathing
Your beauty I'm seeing
It makes me believe in love
You make me believe in love
It's a whole new feeling
Make me believe in love
You put the blue into my skies
You're the gold in my sunshine
You can make a rainbow
When there's no rain in sight
I never needed someone more
Suddenly I feel reborn
Like a child I want you to hold me in your arms
It's of you I'm dreaming
The touch I'm needing
You make me believe in love
It's your scent I'm breathing
Your beauty I'm seeing
It makes me believe in love
You make me believe in love
It's a whole new feeling
Make me believe in love
We enter life with rules
We're told this is the way
Decisions made for us
In which we have no say
What right have they to judge
The way our life should be
As we forget the past and the future's ours
To fill new life without hurt
The future calls your name
And now your time has come
Before your chance has gone
Have been washed away
And we have come too far
For us to throw it all away away away...
That the one true path was right before my eyes
That you're really something you were made for me
And who can tell me baby
The reason or the rhyme
You get me every time
Didn't you know you're the best thing
Didn't I say you're the best thing
Now I really know you
You put the light into my life
I never hoped to understand
Thought to love someone was a dreamer's hand
I found it all a mystery
But you made me give so very easily
And when I'm with you baby
I fall into your arms
Could resist your charms
Didn't you know you're the best thing
Didn't I say you're the best thing
Now I really know you
You put the light into my life
Didn't you know you're the best thing
Didn't I say you're the best thing
Now I really know you
You put the light into my life
Didn't you know you're the best thing
Didn't you know you're the best thing
Didn't you know you're the best thing
And who can tell me baby
The reason or the rhyme
You get me every time
Didn't you know you're the best thing
Didn't I say you're the best thing
Now I really know you
How can you say you don't feel it anymore
This was the love that you never felt before
Don't you remember when I was your everything
Give it time and you will see
Oh baby please let me hold you again
How can I show what your love means to me
Give it time and you will see
Begging you please let me hold you again
Give it time and you will see
Begging you please let me hold you again
I dream I hold you tight
Baby I promise that I'll never stray
Baby I'll show you that we are the same
That's one thing I'd never do...
When I sleep at night
I dream I hold you tight
Baby I promise that I'll never stray
Baby I'll show you that we are the same
Baby I'll show you that we are the same
Baby I promise that I'll never stray
Deep inside I need you with me baby
The way you're touching me it sets me free
Come on and liberate me girl
Your body heat it tastes so sweet
When I need your love baby
When I need your love baby
The way you're touching me it sets me free
Come on and liberate me girl
Your body heat it tastes so sweet
When I need your love baby
When I need your love baby
I need to feel you by my side
You bring my fantasies alive
You've got this power to hold me
You've got the strength to control me
I'll follow you if you show me
You've got the heart to console me
You've got this power to hold me
You've got the strength to control me
I'll follow you if you show me
You've got the heart to console me
I feel you tremble deep inside
It's like an addiction
I need you close to keep alive
You've got this power to hold me
You've got the strength to control me
I'll follow you if you show me
You've got the heart to console me
You've got this power to hold me
You've got the strength to control me
I'll follow you if you show me
You've got the heart to console me
When you're all alone
And the nights seem way too long
Just don't hesitate to call
Gotta open up your heart
Love will make a start
Help you leave the past behind
I can give you wings to fly
Baby we can touch the sky
Can I get close to you
I wanna lay down by your side
Show you how I really feel
Don't have my love pass you by
Know that this time is for real
Gotta open up your heart
Love will make a start
Help you leave the past behind
I can give you wings to fly
Baby we can touch the sky
Gotta open up your heart
Love will make a start
Help you leave the past behind
I can give you wings to fly
Baby we can touch the sky
Like I'm all on my own and there's no one to hold
When you walked out the door
I'm bringing my dreams back to life and
That you could never love someone like me
I'm bringing my dreams back to life and...
Night falls on the moon child
Heart calls with a piercing cry
Touch your hand as you close your eyes
Breathing deep and lying still
Silence waits with us until the
When we're together they'll shine forever
Waves break on my mind
Feel my love through the sands of time
Take my hand like a distant child
Whisper a dream into the wild
Breathing deep and lying still
Silence waits with us until the
There was a time when there weren't enough words to say
But I remember when I couldn't keep my hands away
Girl we've got to feed the fire
We've got to get it on again
We've got to make a try
To keep our love alive
We used to know so many happy songs
In the penetrating way that used to turn me on
Once there was fire in our lives
Silver sparks that used to fly
We've got to get it on again
We've got to make a try
To keep our love alive
Once there was fire in our lives
Silver sparks that used to fly
We've got to get it on again
We've got to make a try
To keep our love alive
We've got to make a try
You ask me if there'll come a time
When I grow tired of you
You wonder if this heart of mine
Will lose its desire for you
What makes you think love will end
When you know that my whole life depends
You say you fear I'll change my mind
How can you think love will end
When I've asked you to spend your whole life
You say you fear I'll change my mind
Then our favorite record played
So I turned towards the crowd
Made me spill my wine
Every guy had one question
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
And was headed for the door
So we danced the night away
I hope that she will stay
And maybe I will find out
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
I hope she does it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
I hope she does it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
I know that chicks like to boogie to the beat in the song
And if they won't dance I don't stand a chance
Somebody please tell the record man
To play a disco song so the ladies will dance
Some new dude they just met
And if he comes on strong she can't get away
Somebody play some rock and roll
So I can shake and bake some sweet woman's soul
I know that chicks like to boogie to the beat in the song
They like to drink slow and dance real fast
There wear their jeans so tight and wiggle their class
But when they dance slow I just can't tell
If all the moving parts are put together so well
Somebody please tell the record man
You ask me if there'll come a time
When I grow tired of you
You wonder if this heart of mine
Will lose its desire for you
What makes you think love will end
When you know that my whole life depends
You say you fear I'll change my mind
How can you think love will end
When I've asked you to spend your whole life
You say you fear I'll change my mind
Then our favorite record played
So I turned towards the crowd
Made me spill my wine
Every guy had one question
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
And was headed for the door
So we danced the night away
I hope that she will stay
And maybe I will find out
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
I hope she does it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
I hope she does it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
My heart just beats and beats
Repeats I love you too
Then I knew I walked a mile
My heart just beats and beats
Repeats I love you too
We no longer go alone
My heart just beats and beats
Repeats I love you too
Who comes here every night
It's such a spooky sight
He always dances alone
They stand there hypnotized
He's got a haunting dance of soul
And they showed that love
By dancing with each other
Something happened and
She never danced again
And they say he stayed
Beside her to the end
With her dying breath
She whispered she'd be
With him on the floor
They danced once more
Who is this ghost dancer
You can feel it in the music
She shivers in the night
Dancing to the music in the night
Acts like he's in a spell
Waits till the stroke of twelve
The starts to dance with
When he starts spinning
Under the mirrored ball
The beams of light that fall
You get the strangest feeling
Someone else is there
The way he wraps his arms
Dancing cheek to cheek
As the strobe lights start to flash
There's someone there
Cigarette smoke in the air
You can see her ghostly image
In the mirror of the floor
She reaches up to touch him
And they dance once more
Who is this ghost dancer
You can feel it in the music
She shivers in the night
Dancing to the music in the night
She shivers in the night
Dancing to the music in the night
Who is this ghost dancer
And I'll find some peace of mind
Let these clouds lay low
My destiny I need to know
Just want to watch your kingdom grow
No one think as I run up rainbows
In the middle of the darkness I found my zone
Even when you're so very far from home
All of my life I've been running from the knife
And feeling up his girl like he's never felt a figure before
Looks good when he walks
He's the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
And he could change the world with his hands behind his back
You can find him sitting on your doorstep
Waiting for the surprise
It will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life
He lends his coat for shelter plus he's there for you
There's no way I could describe him
But I will find him sitting on my doorstep
Waiting for the surprise
He will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me
That's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you
You should know that you're just a temporary fix
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me
Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
I'm taking these chances and getting away
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say
I make you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you
You should know that you're just a temporary fix
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will until I find myself with you and
And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And we'll say all of the right things without a clue
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops and my back begins to tingle
Or should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I give up or should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't admitting you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too
When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Even though I do know how you play
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Found myself today singing out your name
If I am I'm crazy for you
Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
But it's you who makes me lose my head
And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool
Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And make me crazy for you
Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over
Send me spinning closer to you
The crazier I turn into
Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
Because I'm too crazy for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
Which forgive you each time
They melt my heart to stone
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I'm the only one in love
Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
You've burnt my heart to stone
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I'm the only one in love
Why do you steal my hand
So I say your name like there should be an us
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry
I need to get away to feel again
This love has dried up and stayed behind
Then choke on words I'd always hide
I need to taste the kiss from someone new
Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love
Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things
See when hard work don't pay off
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love
Go ahead and steal my heart
As much as it did then
When we were both right
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
So who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of...
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong
And I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
You're set in stone and I never give in
I think you're giving off way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
I've never known this inevitable
You're the first to make out whenever we are two
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
In this situation I'll be glad
I'll be glad to make an exception
You're set in stone and I never give in
I think you're giving off way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
In my eyes your were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Where'd you go when you stay behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Never mind said your open arms
I couldn't help believe the trick me back into them even tho
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
Then I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I don't get nothing back
I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing all the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life
Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel
I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
So scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can start to begin what's begun
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
Scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart so bad
It cuts through the deepest parts of me
And fills up my mouth with words that I cry
How I'm still trying to stay inside
Hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts
Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts
Every now and then my memories ache
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd made
But as time goes on and my age gets older
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts
Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts
You made me leave you
Can't have you the way
I don't want you at all
You made me leave you
Can't have you the way
I don't want you at all
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops and my back begins to tingle
Or should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I give up or should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
Which forgive you each time
They melt my heart to stone
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I'm the only one in love
Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
You've burnt my heart to stone
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I'm the only one in love
Why do you steal my hand
So I say your name like there should be an us
You made me leave you
Can't have you the way
I don't want you at all
You made me leave you
Can't have you the way
I don't want you at all
Found myself today singing out your name
If I am I'm crazy for you
Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
But it's you who makes me lose my head
And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool
Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And make me crazy for you
Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over
Send me spinning closer to you
The crazier I turn into
Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
Because I'm too crazy for you
Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love
Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things
See when hard work don't pay off
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love
Go ahead and steal my heart
As much as it did then
When we were both right
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
So who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of...
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
You're set in stone and I never give in
I think you're giving off way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
I've never known this inevitable
You're the first to make out whenever we are two
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
In this situation I'll be glad
I'll be glad to make an exception
You're set in stone and I never give in
I think you're giving off way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong
And I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
And feeling up his girl like he's never felt a figure before
Looks good when he walks
He's the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
And he could change the world with his hands behind his back
You can find him sitting on your doorstep
Waiting for the surprise
It will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life
He lends his coat for shelter plus he's there for you
There's no way I could describe him
But I will find him sitting on my doorstep
Waiting for the surprise
He will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing all the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Smash it on the floor
Take whatever is left
And take it with you out the door
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
And be thankful when it's done
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Say what's on your mind
Shout and say things that are so unkind
See if I stand firm or if I fall
And on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
So take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
And be thankful when it's done
There are many ways to act
There's so many shades of black

As much as it did then

You should know I chose to be alone
So who wants to be right as rain

And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops and my back begins to tingle
Or should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I give up or should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Fool that I am for falling in love with you
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too
You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette
Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand
And thinking you would listen to all of the things
The things I had planned
But we couldn't see eye to eye
Darling this is goodbye
You made me leave you
Can't have you the way
I don't want you at all
You made me leave you
Can't have you the way
I don't want you at all
There's a fire starting in my heart
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
The scars of your love remind me of us
We could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
We could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow
We could have had it all
We could have had it all
We could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hand
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you strayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
People say crazy things
Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
I can't keep up with your turning tables
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
Under haunted skies I see you
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
I can't keep up with your turning tables
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
Next time I'll be braver
When the thunder calls for me
Next time I'll be braver
Standing on my own two feet
I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
No final kiss to seal any seams
I had no idea of the state we were in
I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head
The reason you loved me before
I often think about where I went wrong
But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head
The reason you loved me before
Gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
And hope that you'd find the missing piece
To bring you back to me
The reason you loved me before
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
I'll be better without you
But they don't know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew
I can't bear this time
It drags on as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you've left behind
Wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone
I can't do it on my own
I'm willing to take the risk
I can't do it on my own
I'm willing to take the risk
I'm so scared to step into this ride
I won't forgive me if I give up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead
I can't do it on my own
I'm willing to take the risk
I can't do it on my own
I am willing to take the risk
There will be times we'll try and give it up
I can't do it on my own
I'm willing to take the risk
I can't do it on my own
I am willing to take the risk
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait
He can't do it on his own
He's willing to take the risk
He can't do it on his own
I'm willing to take the risk
He can't do it on his own
We're willing to take the risk
I can't do it on my own
Maybe you got too used to having me around
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
Maybe I should leave to help you see
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
I will change if I must
Everything I do is for you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
Hold me closer one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me for my sins
I've seen your face under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart more than I do
But we had time against us and miles between us
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you
I'll be waiting for you
When you're ready to love me again
I'll be waiting for you
When you're ready to love me again
Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me and pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
But we had time against us and miles between us
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you
I'll be waiting for you
When you're ready to love me again
I'll be waiting for you
When you're ready to love me again
I know I left you speechless
I'll be waiting for you
When you're ready to love me again
I'll be waiting for you
When you're ready to love me again
Lose myself in time just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me so long
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine
Promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts
Lose yourself in time at the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine
I promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Trust me I've learned it
I promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts
Come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again
I will always love you
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again
I will always love you
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
I had hoped you'd see my face
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
I had hoped you'd see my face
I wish nothing but the best for you
I thought I told you he'd be home soon
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees
But I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
And let yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
Than I ever did you before
And let yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you
I ain't yours for no taking
I could never look in your eyes and settle for wrong
Well I found a boy who loves me more
Than you ever did before
And let yourself down
Four cold walls against my will
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul
Four cold walls against my will
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul
I met someone by accident
And it was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
Neon lights and waiting papers
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
Woke up feeling heavyhearted
I'm going back to where I started
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
Lose myself in time just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me so long
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine
Promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts
Lose yourself in time at the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine
I promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Trust me I've learned it
I promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts
Come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
No final kiss to seal any seams
I had no idea of the state we were in
I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head
The reason you loved me before
I often think about where I went wrong

Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
Turn down these voices inside my head
You can't make your heart feel something that it won't
I will lay down my heart and I will feel the power
The love you don't feel when you're home with me
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
And I will give up this fight
You can't make your heart feel something that it won't
I will lay down my heart and I will feel that power
There's a fire starting in my heart
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
The scars of your love remind me of us
We could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
We could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow
We could have had it all
We could have had it all
We could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hand
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again
And face it all together
And face it all together
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
But you'll never have my heart
And face it all together
And face it all together
I know I'd never be me
Put your hand in my hand
And face it all together
And face it all together
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again
And face it all together
And face it all together
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
But you'll never have my heart
And face it all together
And face it all together
I know I'd never be me
Put your hand in my hand
And face it all together
And face it all together
I was wondering if after all these years
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
I'm in California dreaming about who
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt
Before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
You never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
It's so typical of me to talk
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
You never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
You never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
You put your hands all
Over my body and told me
I'd be your last love
Everlasting you and me
Send my love to your new lover
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
We both know we ain't kids no more
You were falling down
Send my love to your new lover
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
We both know we ain't kids no more
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
We both know we ain't kids no more
We both know we ain't kids no more
We both know we ain't kids no more
I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your oceans too
Treat me soft but touch me cruel
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
And kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
We play so dirty in the dark
It only makes it harder baby
It only makes it harder baby
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
Everybody here is watching you
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Hoping you're someone I used to know
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
We were sad of getting old
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
I was so scared to face my fears
And I swear you moved overseas
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
We were sad of getting old
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
We were sad of getting old
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breath
This ain't easy it's not meant to be
Every story has it's scars
When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whenever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
And I will always love you
When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
If you're not the one for me
If you're not the one for me
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey if I'm not the one for you
It's so cold out here
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
You never seem to make it through the door
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
The only thing that I want is your love
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
I can't go back to the river
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
I can't go back to the river
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Take your eyes off me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
You have given me something I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to mean
That you are in my life
That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
I only wanted to have fun
I let my heart decide the way
Deep down I must have always known
That is would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can spend the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
I will leave my heart at the door
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left
I know there is no tomorrow
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
I know there is no tomorrow
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Is we can break every low
I find it funny that you're the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to
The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
The sweetest devotion I've known
I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to
The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
The sweetest devotion I've known
In every face that I've ever known
That finally feels like home
You're the right kind of madness
The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
The sweetest devotion I've known
I have loved you all my life
Thinking about it all the time
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
There's too much that I haven't said
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know I can't let go
But you still went for the kill
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know I can't let go
Ooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Ooh I thought I died in your arms
I hid it in the seam of your coat
Do you even know that I can't let go
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to
Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
There must be something in the water
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through
I can't decide if I should run and hide
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breath
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and dark of my universe
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
For just about fifteen
I keep walking for miles
They don't understand
They can't understand
They won't understand
It was a great big lie
They don't understand
They don't understand
They won't understand
She had turned me off
In my beginning there was nothing
So empty in the space between
And created what has come to be
Before I pluck your wings
On your knees you pray for me
Though I'm walking through the shadows
You are with me and you comfort me
But before that would you restore me
Before I pluck your wings
On your knees you pray for me
By a thread we're hanging on
And the hope you don't let go
Know I wanna go with you yeah
On your knees you pray for me
So steady as she goes
Your friends have shown
So steady as she goes
Well here we go again
You've found yourself
So steady as she goes
When you have completed
Then you'll get along
Then you'll get along
So steady as she goes
Well here we go again
You've found yourself
So steady as she goes
That is gathered round
That is gathered round
So steady as she goes
So steady as she goes
Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind
Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
I just wanna have some fun
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
I've had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind
In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
And I see nothing in his eyes
I should have laughed but no rest
The reality of her I can't stand next
Trying to swallow pain with no...
Steady rising from the feet with no letter
Seeing death in the eye would matter
So I only realize that when I give a life
My love gave birth to the feeling that this was God's plan
As walked hand in hand with the Earth
I'm still standing...
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
A life in the world...
A flight I take to see a hard...
Every love deserves to see what truth can
Your mind was already made up
When I see your soul ...
Reminiscent what we had was fragmented
Drunk in my thoughts and vision
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
The reason we are far from the damage
The reason we go away to manage
The other things I said before...
Before the... was written
Giving a life... would give me
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
But you burn my heart up with an orange flame.
Don't you know your Mama has a heart of gold
Of hoping and waiting and anticipating to see her there
Ask anything from anyone
Now you'll regret this opportunity you could've have
Ask anything from anyone
Just another nameless band
With no hope to hold onto
Ask anything from anyone
Just another lonely kid
With nothing to hold onto
You've got nowhere to go and nothing to see
Stop living life like you're gonna get somewhere
Sometimes I feel like caving in...
My walls are closing in
I'm tired of losing sleep
Over little things that shouldn't matter to me
Sometimes I feel like caving in...
My walls are closing in
Such is the tragic story of me
There's only one remaining question left
My walls are closing in
All nights only lead to
My bad dreams tell me what I wanna hear
And sometimes I just can't see you being there to break my fall
Now I can't tell to say it all
So many times I just don't care
So many times waking up just in time to write you this song
No use running with the sweet cross
Time will only tell me what it is I have to do to make it through
And I'm scared by the maybe we'll go for that ride
I'll find out first hand when it's like sometimes
I just can't see you being there to break my fall
So many times I just don't care
Waking up just in time to write you this song
No use learning breaking this cross
If we fuck up we promise that we'll carry on
No one cares and soon much fun so fast its gone
We won't change but we'll still grow
No one knows for us it's what we're all about
Expecting sound when you look out to the crowd
Finding out for ourselves the pain of away
To get us where we are today
We won't change but we'll still grow
We'll find our way back home again
We'll find our way back to our friends
We'll find our way back home again
We'll find our way the end
We won't change but we'll still grow
Sound sounded like your voice
Ringing through my ears
Seems easier staring at the same sky every time we say goodnight
Come Friday maybe I'll get out of bed
And I'll write letters
So that my heart can make me feel better
I'll write this song for you
And I never thought this week would ever end
Can't wait to see your smile again
My heart is aching now
The pedal's to the floor
My mind is racing to recall
Memories of early morn
My eyes fell into yours
I lay there face up on the floor
I hold my breath you sit back
The best night of my life
Seems easier staring at the stars
I'm counting down the days but I can't count the ways
And I'll write letters so my heart can make me feel better
I'll write this song for you and I never thought this week would end
Since morning can't wait to see your smile again
I'll write letters so that my heart can make me feel better
I'll write this song for you
I never thought this week would ever end
Since morning can't wait to see your smile again
Life is easier when we aren't miles apart
I wish one bad dream would bring me back from this sleep that I've spent with you
The morning time is when it hurts the worst
Staring at a silent phone
It would hurt to know you feel the same way as I do
But I'd hate to know you don't
I'll spend another sleepless night chasing thoughts of you
Well this cold sweat keeps me from bed
And all this emptiness was never worth one kiss
The words you've never said always ringing through my head
I just remember the time I fell in love with a girl who didn't have the time for me
She didn't have the time for me
I'll spend another sleepless night chasing thoughts of you
Well this cold sweat keeps me from bed
And all this emptiness was never worth one kiss
I'll spend another sleepless night chasing thoughts of you
Well this cold sweat keeps me from bed
And all this emptiness was never worth one kiss
I'll spend another sleepless night chasing thoughts of you
Well this cold sweat keeps me from bed
To indent me from you
But apparently I do it way too often
To shut up and ignore every word said to you
How can you possibly see
You're digging yourself deeper all the time
It's time that it's the end of us
Am I making myself clear to you
Hope I'm making myself clear to you
It's not like me to voice my opinion
It's only because someone never stop giving theirs
It's not like me to not do anything about it
How can you possibly see
You're digging yourself deeper all the time
It's time that it's the end of us
Am I making myself clear to you
Hope I'm making myself clear to you
It's time that it's the end of us
Am I making myself clear
Now it is the end of us
Am I making myself clear to you
Lets start fresh this time
We've reached this point again
You know I've waited for these days and weeks to end
Saddest playing so long
As tears roll down your face
And I'm thinking about you
And missing long goodbyes
You know id die for one last phone call just to say goodnight
I wanna tell you that
I hope this song will remind you of the time we spent away
Will only meet on better days
Your home is here with me
But for now ill miss the things that you appreciate in me
Ill sleep next to the phone tonight
Your home is here with me your home is here with me
Ill sleep next to the phone tonight
My life it seems way too short
By one they go straight through the door
I wish tomorrow happened yesterday
It scares me so to think of what's to come
I don't want to run ahead and throw it all away
I guess it's all to soon to just assume
Not sure exactly why I'm so scared
I guess we'll leave it up to time to decide
I wish tomorrow happened yesterday
It scares me so to think of what's to come
I don't want to run ahead and throw it all away
I wish tomorrow happened yesterday
It scares me so to think of what's to come
I don't want to run ahead and throw it all away
Tonight seems colder than the last
And the drive home seems far too long
I left so many months ago
But I'm still not home
Staring at the yellow line
Singing songs in my head
I'm wishing you were here
You left before I did
Tell me that you won't leave
This time it's different I'm struggling to breathe
Tell me that he's just a friend
I guess I'm too scared to listen
Say goodbye one last time
It's not that easy losing love to one girl of your life
It's not that easy loving your best friend
Tonight seems colder than the last
In my head I'm wishing you were here
Tell me that you won't leave
This time it's different I'm struggling to breathe
Tell me that he's just a friend
I guess I'm too scared to listen
Say goodbye one last time
It's not that easy losing love to one girl of your life
Say goodbye one last time
Say goodbye one last time
It's not that easy losing love to one girl of your life
It's not that easy losing your best friend
Somebody stop him please.
Conversation cuts ties.
Somebody stop me please.
Everything everyone never said
Somebody break me please.
Please move on with your life.
Sky filled with emptiness.
Everything you never said
Grasping for sleep I can't breath
I can't escape from this dream
The glass like sheets blankets what left of
And the street invites me to sleep
This crowds enough to drown me
I won't let go don't let me
The sun rises my only hopes that the street invites me to sleep
I can't let go let go I can't let go this soon
Escaping this midnight scene
A thread of life winds oh so aimlessly
From breech to breech
And blossom oh so gently toward the sky
Life will bloom so delicately
Right before our eyes we see it clearly
Passing time slips oh so quickly
Out from under rolling skies
A thread of life winds oh so aimlessly
From breech to breech
And blossom oh so gently toward the sky
Tides will rise while mountains crumble
In the end the earth will tremble
Life will bloom so delicately
Right before our eyes we see it clearly
Passing time slips oh so quickly
Out from under rolling skies
To the dirt to reside
Night owls call out while willows weep to the sounds of nearby towns
The slightest symphonies sing
And captivate the evening
With most agreeable strings
And when his hands finally meet
His chorus lulls you to sleep
A tiresome melody invites you
Because you'll find that there is just here.
Cause the other side's never as good as it seems.
Don't let your eyes lead your mind
Or what you want out of life
Will change like the weather.
Cause the other side's never as good as it seems.
So bring on the heavy clouds...
That seem to circle your house
But soon enough it will dry
In the warmth of the sunlight.
To be the last time consider this
I'll bet I'll bet you're waiting
I'll bet I'll bet you're waiting
I won't you I won't let you
Please don't try to I'll see right through
I hope you get this message in time
There is a tear in the sky
I know there is no chance to survive
There is no hope for a life
You can set it free or sink it
And if you feet should leave the deck
I saw the moon fall down from his throne
And leave this rock on her own
She wept and wept and flooded us out
You can set it free or sink it
And if you feet should leave the deck
All of our souls are marching single file
Ticking till the sun will someday cease to
Shine into your eyes.
All we've got is time.
My eyes are swirling with a black and white design.
Ticking till the sun will someday cease to
Shine into your eyes.
All we've got is time.
Arms out to reach you as I dive into those eyes.
And view a world that's fallen underneath your spell.
Through the dark open sea.
Only then will you see.
Ticking till the sun will someday cease to
Shine into your eyes.
All we've got is time.
Lover I saw a pink sun fade away
And loved her so long night turned into to day
I'm so lost where have you gone
I'm so lost where have you gone
Lover I felt several blades of grass
And rested there till one whole year had past
I'm so lost where have you gone
I'm so lost where have you gone
When will I have you like the sky
Where we can use the clouds to hide
So we can swim around in blue and white
And I can feel your sun from both sides
I'm so lost where have you gone
I'm so lost where have you gone
We'll put these hopes into the sky
We'll flood the sun and drown the earth in our light
Tied tightly to these lazy limbs that you've been dragging slowly.
And wish away the list of things in life that you could erase.
Pull everything you've ever known down with you through the floor.
Where you will be submerged in dirt and swallowed whole by the Earth.
My heart beats like a clock
That can't speed up and won't slow down
She moves like waves within the sea
Her kiss sends ripples all around
And just before I start to sink
My mind begins remembering
All those year we spent afloat
Because I'd rather be lonely
Her stare is like a thousand suns
That blind my eyes and take my sight
And leave me crawling in the dark
A helpless victim in the night
Her voice is like a symphony
That plays a lovely melody
Or say goodbye to being free
Because I'd rather be lonely
I'm trying to believe that you're holding me
I want to see your right when I'm wrong
I just want to be what you want for me this time
Take me where I'm never lonely
I want to live my life your way
I'm trying to receive what you've offered me
I want to see your light tear through the blanket of night
I just want to be what you want for me all the time
Trust in you my father
You're my air and water
You're everything I need
It's finally calming down
I've found the motion of life that spins around
Grows dim as I enter in
A trail of tears sing Your embrace
The scars of death and life we face
But I know I'll be with You soon
I'll finally fall down at Your feet
And feel your open arms take hold of me
I'll finally touch Your wounded hands
And see the beauty of what You have planned
Revealing grace's final call
I can't comprehend at all
My hope will be completed
Seeing You with eyes unveiled
Knowing without You I'd have failed
I'll finally fall down at Your feet
And feel your open arms take hold of me
I'll finally touch Your wounded hands
And see the beauty of what You have planned
My anticipation turns into desperation
When I think of when I will be with You my Jesus
I'll finally fall down at Your feet
And feel your open arms take hold of me
I'll finally touch Your wounded hands
Hear my heart lord as I cry out to You
Hear my prayer Lord and carry me through
In Your mercy in the promise You made
Be my strength Lord when my strength fades away
Completely all I need
Your grace and peace are perfect
Completely all I need
You're all that I need
In my weakness I'm finding your strength
In my sorrow a gentle embrace
Through the seasons of laughter or pain
When I call out Your name
Completely all I need
Your grace and peace are perfect
Completely all I need
You're all that I need
I'll find you when I seek
I'll look for You with all of my heart
And I'll find You when I'm weak
Hear my heart Lord as I cry out to You
Hear my prayer Lord and carry me through
Completely all I need
Your grace and peace are perfect
Completely all I need
Just room enough for me to think and pray about each new day
Draw me from my drowning apathetic state
Just watch the rain melt all my doubt away
Fire away the heated arrows to my lukewarm state
Today is going to be the day He made
One day is all that we've got to give and take
Bend and break my mind and heart to feel the urgent need
To take all I see and pour my life into eternity
And take it all today and give everything
And take it all today
Overwhelm me with Your love
Drown away the crashing waves
Leave me water for my soul
Overwhelm me with Your love
And heal my broken heart
Keep me down upon my knees
Till your love is all I see
I have my hope in the beauty of Your majesty
And all that I cannot see
Because of what You gave up
How do I start to say that I'm thankful Jesus
Overwhelm me with Your love
Set my mind on things above
Show me what You have in store
For my home beyond this world
Overwhelm me with Your love
And burn my heart again
So I know I'm forgiven
I know you hear me very time I whisper to the throne
I'm all I am because of You
Because of what You gave up
How do I start to say that I'm thankful Jesus
I know you hear me very time I whisper to the throne
I'm all I am because of You
Because of what You gave up
How do I start to say that I'm thankful Jesus
I know you hear me very time I whisper to the throne
Jesus my heart belongs to You
But I feel like I failed to be all that I've wanted to
With not much to give to You
I won't waste this time
I'm coming back to You
I won't waste this time
I won't waste this time
I won't waste this time
Jesus I'm lifeless far from You
Forgive me for waiting
To believe in the grace You've offered me
And here I am with not much to give to You
I won't waste this time
I'm coming back to You
I won't waste this time
I won't waste this time
I won't waste this time
A rush of words too small to thank You
But I've been so consumed by Your unending love
How do I even begin to repay
I won't waste this time
I'm coming back to You
I won't waste this time
I won't waste this time
I feel much stronger now I know You
Your beauty pierces my heart
Your love is so much deeper
And bolder than the purest dark
You've taken all my shame
And I don't know if I'll ever fathom
What it took to give it all away
And I don't know if I'll ever know
All the debt I'll never have to pay
You take the coldest part of my heart
And turn it to overflowing joy
And this beauty is what You have restored
Your love has paved the way
And I don't know if I'll ever fathom
What it took to give it all away
And I don't know if I'll ever know
All the debt I'll never have to pay
You gave Your life in place of
What I should have paid my debt for
How could I have ever lived without You
And I don't know if I'll ever fathom
What it took to give it all away
And I don't know if I'll ever know
What have I done lord Jesus to deserve this endless love
What have I done lord Jesus to be worthy of your grace
What have I done lord Jesus to standing here with you
What have I done lord Jesus to be worthy of you
For I am nothing yet love me
I am no one yet you care
You thought of me when you died
What have I done to deserve this love
And I lay down my will
My life I life I give hence forth to live for you alone
For I am nothing yet love me
I am no one yet you care
You thought of me when you died
What have I done to deserve this love
What have I done lord Jesus to deserve this endless love
What have I done lord Jesus to be worthy of your grace
What have I done lord Jesus to standing here with you
What have I done lord Jesus to be worthy of you
You made me worthy of you
Broken when I'm kneeling
I find in my hidden shelter with you
Raw and pure is treasure I know
Deep within your presence o Lord
And this hopefulness you give me
And as the world will change
You'll always be the same
And the days will fade away
But you remain the same
Broken when I realize
That you love me in my weakness
And you have given more in my life And I'm humbled by your kindness o Lord
And you will always be the same
And this hopefulness you give me
And as the world will change
You'll always be the same
And the days will fade away
But you remain the same
And as the world will change
You'll always be the same
And the days will fade away
And a time to every purpose under heaven
A time to cast away stones
A time to gather stones together
A time you may embrace
A time to refrain from embracing
I'm still falling here
Telling me to turn my eyes
But I don't know what else to do
And bring my brokenness to you
But into your presence
Lead to this redemption
Father you know the way nobody knows
Wounded as the ground
Love held to the cross cried out mercy song
Still we break and bend by the weight of all our sin
There is nothing we can do
But Bring our weariness to you
But into your presence
Lead to this redemption
Father you know the way nobody knows
But into your presence
Lead to this redemption
Father you know the way nobody knows
But into your presence
Lead to this redemption
Left my fear by the side of the road
Fall to my knees as I lift my hands to pray
Got every reason to be here again
Father's love that draws me in
And all my eyes wanna see is a glimpse of You
All I need is You Lord
One more day and it's not the same
Your spirit calls my heart to sing
Drawn to the voice of my Saviour once again
Where would my soul be without Your Son
Gave His life to save the earth
Rest in the thought that You're watching over me
All I need is You Lord
You hold the universe
You hold everyone on earth
You hold the universe
All I need is You Lord
When the storm is raging all around me
You are the peace that calms
And the cares of this world
You are the light that shines
I'm captured by this love I see
Your mercy brings me to my knees
It's Your mercy that has made me free
When my sin is all that I can see
Your grace remains the shelter that I seek
And when my weakness is all I can give
Your gentle Spirit gives me strength again
On the cross You showed Your love for me
I'm captured by this love I see
Your mercy brings me to my knees
It's Your mercy that has made me free
I'm captured by this love I see
Your mercy brings me to my knees
It's Your mercy that has made me free
Look up to see the light of our redemption
To sing the saving name Jesus
To you I only hope our loving Father
To calls us from our sin
From dying to find life again
With hope for all the broken down
And turn this broken earth
Your People stand to wait mouth the kingdom
For you will to be done as it is in Heaven
Oh Father Let it come
Oh Love Come Down to us
Robed in righteousness and crowned with love
I shall be made like Him
To the place He has prepared for me
I will be with the One I love
With unveiled face I'll see Him
There my soul will be satisfied
At His feet I'll lay my crowns My worship
I will be with the One I love
With unveiled face I'll see Him
There my soul will be satisfied
Though I have not seen Him
My heart knows Him well
Jesus Christ the Lamb
I will be with the One I love
With unveiled face I'll see Him
There my soul will be satisfied
Test me in these flames until
Piercing through the darkness
Search out anything in me
No more living in my own way
Following my own path
Living for my own desires
Surrender everything before You
Oh god I need you here with me
Your the Shelter in the storm
Oh God I love to speak your name
Your the Shelter in the storm
I will be watching waiting still
Till your love comes back for me
I will be watching waiting still
Life from life sustaining us
Earth below and skies above
Beautiful redemption's song
Melodies like morning rise
Darkness leaning toward the dawn
Into our sorrow sings the light
Beautiful redemption song
Hope restored and death undone
Beautiful redemption song
Weeping will not last the night
Nor will sadness be for long
Joy was born of sacrifice
Beautiful redemption song
Hope restored and death undone
Beautiful redemption song
Let the wounded come and see
Empty grave and lifted stone
Oh you bring hope to the hopeless
And light to those in the darkness
Oh you give peace to the restless
And joy to homes that are broken
And you open the door for me
And you lay down your life to set me free
All that I am will serve you Lord
Oh you fill those who are empty
And rescue those in the valley
And through it all you calm my soul
Oh now you find me in my weakness
And heal the wounds of my heartache
And I worship you in spirit and truth
And you open the door for me
And you lay down your life to set me free
All that I am will serve you Lord
And you open my eyes to see
All the wonder and awe of Christ in me
Jesus you're everything I need
And you open the door for me
And you lay down your life to set me free
All that I am will serve you Lord
And you open my eyes to see
All the wonder and awe of Christ in me
Take my heart I lay it down
At the feet of You who is crowned
And take my life I'm letting go
Take my fret take my fear
All I have I'm leaving here
Be all my hopes be all my dreams
Be all my delights be my everything
You Lord only You Lord
Before You only You Lord
Take my heart I lay it down
At the feet of You Who's crowned
And take my life I'm letting go
To you Who is throned Jesus
And it's just You and me here now
And It's just You and me here now
And it's just You and me Lord
It's just You and me Lord
Are you ready for an X my O's now
You must drink your apple juice
You better speak my sex
And she's got cooties
You must drink your Gatorade
You better speak my sex
You better speak my sex
Wednesday's panties on a Friday night
Bounce that 93 Honda Civic
Stacked in the back and he's all up in it
Don't want to meet your mom
Everybody get some cherry candy yum yum
Eat it on the first date
Coming straight to third base
Swinging in the tree house
Paper bag bitch busted in the face
Don't want to meet your mom
Everybody get some cherry candy yum yum
Even on the first date
Going straight to third base
Everybody get some cherry candy yum yum
Even on the first date

I'm a pretty mess and I don't deserve you
I ran out of time and second chances
Sorry couldn't build your white picket fences
And I only got myself to blame
And I got so much left to say
Yeah we're all about it
Don't tell cast a spell
Ain't no way around it
Too rare not to stare
They all wanna try me
But there's no one like me
Everything we do is magic
We make other girls look tragic
Flashes pop the cameras
Stand up you're with us
They know all about ya
We don't need to pose
It's not in our fashion
Is a heart to blacken
Everything we do is magic
We make other girls look tragic
Calling all goddesses
Calling all goddesses
Don't believe what you see
Walking sadly through the park
I hear crying in the darkness
And though I act like I cannot hear
The situation is very clear
A girl who's trying to tell her guy
The time has come that they say goodbye
And his answer tears my heart apart
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl I'll just forget you
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you
Walking with you through the park
Now it's my voice in the darkness
Just like the girl trying to tell her guy
I'm telling you we must say goodbye
I can't believe when I hear once more
The very words that were said before
Come from deep within your broken heart
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl I'll just forget you
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl I'll just forget you
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you
A human ball of laundry
Don't need to brush my hair out
Birds need a nest to hang out
Heels are a step from breaking
But I'm still good at snatching
Had you from the beginning
I'm playing dumb and winning
My nails are broken busted
But I'm still fucking dusted
I'm a goddamn mermaid
I don't even care who gives a shit
Skin on my knees is bleeding
Time for a psychic reading
Give Dionne Warwick a call cause pride comes before the fall
My hair's never seen a brush
Smells like jungle juice and rush
We got your pussy popping
And there's no sign of stopping
Take us to 10 billion hits
I left you like 7 messages
And I brought a list of names when we're ready for kids
Kept a locket of your hair for my collection of you
I've called like 10 times
I even called your house phone and left a message with your mother
I haven't heard from you yet
I like what you were wearing last night...
A shiver down my spine won't keep me from it
You bitches better beware
You're giving me the creeps
You're giving me the creeps
You're giving me the creeps
You're giving me the creeps
There's fame in our walk
My address is Hollywood
My address is Hollywood
My address is Hollywood
We're still in the show
We're not supposed to be meeting like this
But when we get close I know we're gonna kiss
Can't keep my cool when I'm dancing with fire
Thirsty for you in an animal way
How do you do what you do to me babe
He he he he and he and he and and he and he and he and and as and
As he and as he and he.
As he is and he and he and and he and he.
As proportions as presently.
Was there was there was there what was there was there what was there was there there was there
Let me recite what history teaches. history teaches.
I want to dance with my baby
And when the music starts
It's gonna drive me crazy
Makes the bourgeoisie
Don't think of yesterday
It's like riding on the wind
And it never goes away
Touches everything I'm in
Got to have it everyday
Makes the bourgeoisie
I want to dance with my baby
And when the music starts
It's gonna drive me crazy
Makes the bourgeoisie
Don't think of yesterday
It's like riding on the wind
And it never goes away
Touches everything I'm in
Got to have it everyday
Makes the bourgeoisie
Music music music music
Maybe this was meant to be.
Maybe now it should be me.
Been dreaming of this forever.
But I'm feeling so confused.
And I don't know what to do.
We'll stay together always that's the promise we made.
But suddenly it's not so clear.
And I'm being pulled both ways.
It's impossible to choose.
Everything that I've dreamed right in front of me.
If I win I'm going to lose.
How can I learn to live one day with what if.
Things will never be the same.
Maybe that's the price of fame.
Been waiting for this forever.
It's close enough for me to touch.
But is it worth us breaking up.
We'll stay together always is the promise we made.
But suddenly it's not so clear.
And I'm being pulled both ways.
It's impossible to choose.
Everything that I've dreamed right in front of me.
If I win I'm going to lose.
Could be the chance of a lifetime.

Simple things in life will fulfill
Fast cars and a love making noise

Live in your material world

I'm captured by the way you entice me
I kinda like the way it's flowing
It's uncontrollable and I just can't help it
When I try to leave and I'm right back at it
It's so uncontrollable and I just can't hide it
My focus is gone by the beat of your drums
I can't even sleep and I can't even analyze
I kinda like the way it's flowing
It's uncontrollable and I just can't help it
When I try to leave and I'm right back at it
It's so uncontrollable and I just can't hide it
It's uncontrollable and I just can't help it
When I try to leave and I'm right back at it
It's so uncontrollable and I just can't hide it
When I try to leave it keeps on pushing me
It's uncontrollable and I just can't help it
When I try to leave and I'm right back at it
It's so uncontrollable and I just can't hide it
Go hard and show me that you really want me
And maybe I'll give you the time of day
Maybe your eyes are a little bigger than your appetite
Maybe your eyes are a little bigger than your appetite
A little more maybe a peep show
I'm sure it would get you started but I don't think so
I like to make you want it go crazy on my curves
Got you all fascinated and that's my plan
Maybe your eyes are a little bigger than your appetite
Switch my wardrobe every season
I'm not like the rest
I ain't got it for cheap
I'm not like the rest
I ain't got it for cheap
Mummy always wants you to come for tea
I wanna know just what to do
I got a house with windows and doors
I'll show you mine if you show me yours
Say you'll do what I don't
Say you'll do what I don't
I'll be the queen and you'll be the king
I got a house with windows and doors
I'll show you mine if you show me yours
Say you'll do what I don't
Say you'll do what I don't
Say you'll do what I don't
Say you'll do what I don't
And all you need to bring is yourself
Give it up Mr. blue sky
Speeding right on into the bay
Everybody wave as we drive by
To the beach where we're gonna stay
Whenever dark turns to night
And all the dreams sing their song
In the daylight forever
Where the waves broke
I drew a heart for you
In fields where streams
Whenever dark turns to night
And all the dreams sing their song
In the daylight forever
Whenever dark turns to night
And all the dreams sing their song
In the daylight forever
We'll give you quite a chill
Your imagination take over on this ride
You'd better believe it
We'll give you quite a chill
Your imagination take over on this ride
It's just one more day
No one said there would be rain again
I'll blame it on the weatherman
Here I am out on my own again
I'll blame it on the weatherman
I could see your face
Just blame it on the weatherman
I could see your face
Maybe I can't blame the weatherman
We four girls are here to stay
We four girls are here to stay
We four girls are here to stay
Here my head up in the clouds
I feel I'm spinning around
Dreams will come and go
But this is here to stay
And say the things you say
So here we are at the start of this road
Together building castles in the air
Words we don't need without you I don't breathe
Forever building castles in the air
So softly like a sigh
Sea where the white horses ride
A feeling deep inside
So our time will go on
And say the things you say
So here we are at the start of this road
Together building castles in the air
Words we don't need without you I don't breathe
Platform shoes too high for hip hop
Step aside and let us in

Crazy shoes to new for hip hop
Faces places never never

Wake up people we've arrived

Step aside and let us in
Nothing stops me loving you.
So tell me do you feel the way I feel...
You put color in my life.
Sleep with thoughts of you until daylight.
Keep this loving feeling deep inside.
Oh how I wanted to be...
Tell me do you feel the way I feel...
You put color in my life
Baby I just have to see your face
Please don't tell me I'm in your way
All of my heart is in it
Gimme a chance boy don't turn me down
I'll be your King and you can wear my crown
You get stronger every time
All of my heart is in it
You get stronger every time
You've been on my mind
You've been on my mind
You've been on my mind
You've been on my mind
All of my heart is in it
All of my heart is in it
And as I walk to the beat of my heart inside
I feel like letting go
In my dream you'll be tonight so...
Tell me you've a letter
I am waiting here for you
Tell me it will be here tonight
And as I walk to the beat of my heart inside
I feel like letting go
Tell me you've a letter
I am waiting here for you
Tell me it will be here tonight...
There's no more waiting here for him
And now I won't write...
Don't you think your bigger than me
Oh you know you're replaceable
Mirror mirror just tell him what you see
I thought you'd figured it out before
You know you really gotta
You're wearing a hat you're too big for
Don't you think your bigger than me
Oh you know you're replaceable
The way you're chewing your gum it wrecks my head
Why don't you bite on these words that I'm saying baby
I thought you'd figured it out before
You know you really gotta
You're wearing a hat you're too big for
Don't you think your bigger than me
Oh you know you're replaceable
You never made decisions and you never think twice
Always complaining like before
Always complaining like before
Don't you think your bigger than me
Oh you know you're replaceable
Don't you think your bigger than me
Oh you know you're replaceable
Standing on a crowded train
Wishing all the time away
Every little thing I do
Never mind the stormy weather
It's for you I'll be true yes I do
Hear the calling in the wind
We'll fly like a bird
In a scattered cloudy sky
Leave aside the city worries
It's just a minute away
In my heart I'll paint a picture
Come and look in silence
Believe in what you see
The starry skies can move the mountains
The sun will warm the sea
In my heart I'll paint a picture
The sun always shines on my garden.
I told you before just knock on my door
You ran away with my spoon
You've stolen my heart
I jumped over the moon
You always make me feel good.
I've never believed in love
That's why I'm letting you know.
The letter I found was yours truly.
You ran away with my spoon
You've stolen my heart
I jumped over the moon
You always make me feel good.
I've never believed in love
That's why I'm letting you know
Whoa letting you know
Whoa I don't want you to go
I've never believed in love
That's why I'm letting you know
I've never believed in love
That's why I'm letting you know
Tomorrow is yesterday
We'll slide on a rainbow
Don't tell me I'm a dreamer
We're gonna get there someday
We're gonna get there someday
I'll tell you something
We're gonna get there someday
We're gonna get there someday
Has there crazy world
I'll share it with you
We're gonna get there someday
We're gonna get there someday
Till like a leaf we fall
It's time for seasons to go
Till like a leaf we fall
Till like a leaf we fall
Till like a leaf we fall
Till like a leaf we fall
What's a girl supposed to do
Don't go trying the key in the door
Get up on the ceiling
You don't know what I'm feeling
Act your age and not your shoe size
Get your wheels in motion
And dump that crazy notion
And you will find out
You're with the shy one
Let me reveal one secret to you
This lion's in her cage
Treat her well and treat her good
Get up on the ceiling
You don't know what I'm feeling
Act your age and not your shoe size
Get your wheels in motion
And dump that crazy notion
And you will find out
You're with the shy one
I can't make sense of what's strolling by
And you will find out
You're with the shy one
You're with the shy one
You're with the shy one
Met an old man. Miller his name
Met him on a dusty road
Got off the bus. Heard him singing
I'm ready now lets begin
I've found her heart in so many places
I've seen her smile in so many faces
I listened to his every word
I sat at his feet and looked in his eyes
And I know what he meant
I tell you What he meant
I've found her heart in so many places
I've seen her smile in so many faces
I've found her heart in so many places
I've seen her smile in so many faces
Eight o'clock on the morning that you left
They walked in and told me that you'd gone
That moment on I knew you'd be our angel
Was the hardest day ever
Trying to paint a picture for you
Just for today they all seem blue
We'll join our hands again someday
And talk of the times we had
We'll be together oh someday
And laugh at the fun we had
And light a candle to remind me of you
You'll be on my journey
We'll join our hands again someday
And talk of the times we had
We'll be together oh someday
And laugh at the fun we had
Some people say to me
They say I don't have a clue
I'm gonna make them see
When you've got your arms around me
In the air your love surrounds me
This ain't no make believe
This fantasy is for real
He sweeps me off of my feet
When you've got your arms around me
In the air your love surrounds me
Everything you do to me is supernatural
I need to be beside you
I'll tell you why I'm awake.
There's so many shapes.
And die into the night.
Oh and fly up so high.
Just give me a sign... and I'll know.
Fingers through hair.
Alone it feels like you're there.
I'll tell you how I feel.
Just give me a sign... and I'll know.
There's a green hill far away
In a land I know so well
And the sun its shone so bright
As we walked that winding road
I remember oh so well
The times we spent together
How we laughed and carved our names
And declared our love forever
On that old oak tree we found
There's a green hill far away
In a land I know so well
And the sun it shone so bright
It's just one more day
No one said there would be rain again
I'll blame it on the weatherman
Here I am out on my own again
I'll blame it on the weatherman
I could see your face
Just blame it on the weatherman
I could see your face
Maybe I can't blame the weatherman
You've always been a tough girl
But you feel you're about to break
You're feeling stuck and out of luck
Watching your dreams all slip away
Been working mornings in the kitchen
And working nights at the corner store
There's gotta be something more
Don't run away from what your heart is saying
I know it's hard when your hope is gone
But you gotta keep holding on
You're hear a voice that's calling
And it's telling you to make a change
It's time to fly and say goodbye
And move on to a better place
You know you gotta take the first step
To get to where you wanna be
Just get on track and don't look back
Don't run away from what your heart is saying
I know it's hard when your hope is gone
But you gotta keep holding on
You're gonna be stronger
Just a little bit longer
Be strong when the going gets tough
Don't run away from what your heart is saying
I know it's hard when your hope is gone
But you gotta keep holding on
Don't run away from what your heart is saying
I know it's hard when your hope is gone
I know it's hard when your hope is gone
I know it's hard when your hope is gone
Message after the music.
We'd call and tell you that our fans have been really nice.
Message after the music.
We'd call and tell you that our fans have been really nice.
I know nothing stays the same
And are you willing to play the game
It's coming around again
So don't mind if I fall upon
There's more room in a broken heart
Kiss the host goodbye
I'm so in love with you
I know nothing stays the same
And are you willing to play the game
But I can't take a chance on a chick like you
There's that look in your eyes
Oh but boy you're only a child
Well I can dance with you honey
If you think it's funny
And I can chat with you baby
Take it nice and slow
I can see what you want
So maybe I'm not the one
You're so cute I like your style
And I know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile
Oh but your only a child
Well I can dance with you honey
If you think it's funny
I can chat with you baby
Take it nice and slow
Well I can dance with you honey
If you think it's funny
I can chat with you baby
Well I can dance with you honey
If you think it's funny
I can chat with you baby
But I can dance with you honey
If you think it's funny
I can chat with you baby
It's the only to part
I sleep at night and remember
All the words you said to me
To all your dreams now
So only time will tell the future
Like rain you know it falls
Now here at last soon together
Just a night away you'll see
To all your dreams now
To all your dreams now
To all your dreams now
Here in the shadow of doubt
Baby please don't cry
Lead me to a distant land
Who knows what we will see
And open my eyes to the light
Together forever so right
Lead me to a distant land
Who knows what we will see
Who knows what we will see
Don't be a brontosaurus
Don't you ever walk that way
It's the right thing to do
Just doing what you do
Tell me you're tired of hanging around
And dreaming your life away
We've got the feeling of Saturday night
Everybody gather round
Don't you know what we have found
Count me in with 1 2 3
So tell me what's the story
So keep the bad vibes well away
Tell me you're tired of hanging around
And dreaming your life away
We've got the feeling of Saturday night
Everybody gather round
Count me in with 1 2 3
There's a green hill far away
In a land I know so well
And the sun its shone so bright
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
As we walked that winding road
I remember oh so well
The times we spent together
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
How we laughed and carved our names
And declared our love forever
On that old oak tree we found
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
There's a green hill far away
In a land I know so well
And the sun it shone so bright
In the fields where once we did lay
In the fields where once we did lay
Oh Mickey what a pity you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey you're so pretty can't you understand
Don't break my heart Mickey
So come on and give it to me anyway you can
Oh Mickey what a pity you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey you're so pretty can't you understand
Don't break my heart Mickey
Oh Mickey what a pity you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey you're so pretty can't you understand
Don't break my heart Mickey
Waiting for the phone to ring
To see what lies ahead
Memories on the table
Clothes thrown on the floor
Trace of what was gonna be
But we'll get through this somehow
Together we'll be fine
It's not easy all the time
You knew it would come to this
Together we'll be fine
Conversations that we had
Smiles are coming back again
The power's in our hands
You're finding your way
To think all about you
I could rely that my dreams come true
Leave me the time to forget your passion
And give me the reason to fly to you
I've never been like a burning fire
I got to know it for still love you
It's my only worthy emotion

And now the time was here
All the girls were going
But she was gentle as a kittens purr
Still she had to feel the pain
When they called her name
Plan Jane poor Plan Jane
Oh how she wanted to go to the prom
But no one would ask Plan Jane
Poor little girl living in a cold cold world
And lonely she was lonely as could be
But then the phone rang
Tears began to flow like rain
But they were tear of joy the call was from a boy
She was all excited couldn't wait
Going on her very first date
Spent the whole day getting dressed
Had to look her very best
But now its half past eight
Guess her dates gonna be late
Meanwhile at the prom
And the boy who made the call
He was laughing loudest of all
But there joy turned to tears instead
When the morning paper said a girl was dead
To much pain for a girl with a name Plan Jane
Just to much pain for a girl with a name Plan Jane
If my soul could talk to you
I would reminisce every sweet kiss of yesterday
To all you young fools
I've got a lonesome surprise
And light a candle when love dies
That's when you'll find your stairway
To the sky in the ashes of dreams you let die
You may dream you're close to her
If she tore apart your poor heart
Or would you break down
In sentimental refrain
In rhapsody of lasting pain
That's when with every beat of your heart
Will cry for the ashes of dreams you let die
That tomorrow we'll be married
But tomorrow is never there
Many weeks now have I waited
When I'll have you right by my side
But tomorrow ain't never gonna come
Baby is the only name I've called her
Ever since the day she came my way
And told me she was lonely
When I asked her why baby cried
She told me that no boy ever held her hand
Sixteen and she couldn't understand
When I held her hand baby cried
Then she told me that no boy ever held her tight
Only the ones in her dreams at night
And as I held her tenderly
The strangest feeling came over me
And it told me I too was lonely
Who's the one who used to tickle your toes
And who's the one who'd wake in darkest night
To see if you were alright
His baby sleeping tight
Who's the one who worked so hard all day
But when his job was through
He'd come home and play with you
And who's the one who let you put some lipstick on
And wear your hair down long
And who's the one that would wait up late
Waiting on his baby girl to tell him all about her date
And who's the one who saw your tears were real
And said no matter how you feel
A love wound will heal
And who's the one who's cared your whole life through
Now there's someone who has taken you
And who's the one on your wedding day
Who has to smile and say
I do I give my girl away
The rain keeps falling
Tears keep coming down
I wonder she left town
I'd like to see my girl again
She broke my heart in two
And caused me so much pain
My pillow's soaking wet
I can't find her in the morning
My pillow's soaking wet
I can't find her in the morning
The rain keeps falling
Tears keep coming down
I couldn't find my darling
I wonder she left town
My pillow's soaking wet
Where is she in the morning
I swore I'd return with ecstasy
With fortune and fame
And they'd be so proud of me
Tonight they're waiting at the airport
Never been so long alone
My baby still has faith in me
After all she's been through
She's still waiting for me
For since I've gone I haven't heard
Never been so long alone
Oh I've never been so long alone
No I never never been so long alone
Done a lot things I'm sorry
For things I wouldn't do anymore
But my biggest mistake of all
Was leaving my home town
Since then my foolish thoughts have died
Grass isn't really greener on the other side
They won't forget you're there
There's a cloud of love
And it's hovering over my hometown
Pretty girls see a lonely you
Going to my home town
And there's a sign saying ten more miles to my hometown
Looking through the misty dawn
I see the city lights and they're waving me on
Well you had nothing when I met you baby
But look what you got now
Sometimes I wonder did I make a mistake
But I brought you from the south
So I'm gonna take you back to Georgia
Well back where you belong
You done got in the big city baby
You done started doing me wrong
Well your Momma and your Daddy told me baby
Not to take you from the south
I took you to the city when you were a child
And the fight bout knocked you out
And girl I'm gonna take you back to Georgia
Oh because you don't know a thing
Well when I first met you baby
You couldn't read or write your name
Well you run the streets with your wig hair
Trying to play your high class games
You run the streets both day and night
You don't have pocket change
So I'm gonna take you back to Georgia
Well before I have to lose my mind
Well I just can't understand it baby
What is that makes your head so hot
I'm gonna take you back to Georgia
Right back where you belong
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a night so long
The moon just went behind a cloud
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a robin weep
That means he's lost the will to live
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
It's not unusual to be loved by anyone
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
But when I see you hanging about with anyone
It's not unusual to see me cry
It's not unusual to go out at any time
But when I see you out and about it's such a crime
If you should ever want to be loved by anyone
No matter what you say
You'll find it happens all the time
Why can't this crazy love be mine
It's not unusual to be mad with anyone
It's not unusual to be sad with anyone
But if I ever find that you've changed at anytime
It's not unusual to find that I'm in love with you
Children were laughing then
I could hear a bluebird sing
And the warmth of your arms
Oh the warmth of your arms
And we were walking by the shore
You said you'd marry me
Now I cry but can't you see
These teardrops in my eyes
They're for all we planned
Our whole lives through
Things we'll never do
Things we'll never do
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down.
I'm gonna wait for the midnight hour
When there's no one else around.
And do all the things I told you
In the midnight hour.
I'm gonna wait till stars come out
And see that twinkle in your eyes.
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love begins to shine.
You'll be the only girl I love
And really love you so
In the midnight hour.
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down.
I'm gonna wait for the midnight hour
When there's no one else around.
And do all the things I told you
In the midnight hour.
I'm gonna wait till stars come out
And see that twinkle in your eyes.
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love begins to shine.
You'll be the only girl I love
And really love you so
In the midnight hour.
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
I'll pretend I'm free from sorrow
Make believe that wrong is right
Your wedding day will be tomorrow
But there'll be no teardrops tonight
Are you doing this for spite
If you only want to hurt me
Then there'll be no teardrops tonight
I believe that you still love me
But you think that you're above me
But there'll be no teardrops tonight
Other arms will hold you tight
You don't care whose life you're ruining
Who's the one who tied you shoe when you were young
And knew just when to come and see what you had done
When you told her your first love was over
She'd met someone older mama mama
Results graduation mama mama
When you introduced you future bride
As you walked down the isle through tears you saw her
I told her I'd never leave her in a million days
I told her I'd never leave her in a million days
You found someone new
Since she went away I don't know what I'll do
Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Still in love with you
Today I passed you on the street
Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
And he looked so satisfied
And you know he looked so satisfied
It hurts to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss
How much that I miss yeah
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
If you're lucky enough
To have someone who loves you
Then be glad that you got
Someone who loves you
Cold lips that were warm
Listen to the wisdom of a fool
When you take her poor heart
And you do something to it
And you think to yourself
You may find that the
Listen to the wisdom of a fool
But you still have time to say
I awakened this morning
I was filled with despair
All my dreams turned to ashes and cold
And as I looked at my life
It was barren and bare
Without love I have nothing at all
I have nothing at all
I could conquer the world
But nothing would I have
Without love I have nothing at all
Oh I could conquer the world
But what would I have
I have nothing at all
A star fell from Heaven
A brighter star I know
Then I found out that it was only you
Who came into my life
The twinkle in your eye
Oh you must have strayed
The twinkle in your eye
Oh you must have strayed
If you love me half as much as I love you
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
You only build me up to let me down
If you needed me half as much as I need you
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
I know that I would never never never be blue
Though my heart ached with a love for you
The chance that you might love me too
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
Honey if you love love me half as much as I love you
Down amongst the swamps
Who gets lost in Miller's Cave
You know I had me a girl
But she had unfaithful ways
Just like I wasn't wanted
Like the bats and the bears in Miller's cave
Everybody calls him baby
I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave
Boy y'all gonna pay for this
And they laughed at me
On down to Miller's Cave
Well I guess I showed
In the state of Georgia
They'll never find me
I'll be in New York City
When the lights shine bright tonight
Where my woman waits for me
Arms that hold me tenderly
Lips as sweet as honeycomb
Love that waits for me alone
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
The eyes of a New York woman
Are eyes that can hold a man
She swept me off of my feet
Made my world seem so complete
I'll never have to look for more
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
Thought I wasn't ready
For the tie that binds
But I lost my heart to her
When her eyes met mine
Now I see her differently
I've got to make her mine
So I'll make my home Fun City
And let the lights shine bright on me
I'll never have to look for more
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
The eyes of a New York woman
Are eyes that can hold a man
She swept me off of my feet
Made my world seem so complete
I'll never have to look for more
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
Been sleeping in your head
Those old dark clouds
Been hanging around your head
But all your hard times
Will vanish in the wind
When the mighty clouds of joy
Let your love seize us
When the mighty clouds of joy
Those old storm clouds
Are slowly drifting by
And those old raindrops
Are fading from your eyes
Gonna shine on us again
When the mighty clouds of joy
Let your love seize us
When the mighty clouds of joy
Won't you let your love seize us
Let us find sweet peace within
When the mighty clouds of joy
A lonely soul within me cries
For the lifetime I've wasted
The love that I've tasted
When you hold me in your arms so tight
That you're in love with me
Lips are sweet as candy
The taste stays on my mind
For another cup of wine
But I don't need a cure
I'll just stay addicted
And hope I can endure
All the good love when we're all alone
That you're in love with me
All the good love when we're all alone
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
Something here inside
They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt all love
Yet today my love has flown away
Now laughing friends deride
When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes
Smoke gets in your eyes
Out where the bright lights are glowing
You're drawn like a moth to a flame
You laugh while the wines overflowing
While I sit and whisper your name
Four walls too near me
One night with you is like heaven
And while I'm walking the floor
I listen for steps in the hallway
And wait for your knock on my door
Four walls too near me
Four walls too near me
Just these four lonely walls
And one lonely room is where I stand
And wait for a knock on my door
And needed no one else
Depending only on myself
Crumbling in your hand
You turned me into sand
But stone in love with you
I was a rolling stone
Crumbling in your hand
You turned me into sand
But stone in love with you
Crumbling in your hand
You turned me into sand
But stone in love with you
I've been down this road before
I've felt like this somewhere before
I've felt the warm hand
Yes I've been down that road before
I've walked along this road somewhere
I learned a lot then and there
I know a smile can turn into a frown
I've been down that road before
I missed a lot of chances
And I've seen a green light
To read the detour sign
It's a heavy toll to pay
Empty feelings left to bare
I reached for you but you weren't there
With darkness at my door
Yes I've been down that road before
Yes I've been down that road before
I saw pity in the face of a friend
And that's something I don't wanna see again
With sad eyes he gave me sympathy
Oh I saw pity in the face of a friend
Even though he tried to hide it with a grin
Yes he put on a very good act
So I'm taking that road away from you
Gonna find myself a place to hide
And when people remember they say
He was saving face and pride
I saw pity in the face of my friend
But for some reason I had to look again
And there in his eyes
The truth was plain to see
That you really loved and not me
Oh I saw saw pity in the eyes of my friend
And it told me that you loved only him
And it's tearing me all up inside
Because I like what you're doing
And it's something I've never tried
You're tempting me to come on strong
And when I look in your eyes girl
There's no way to tell right from wrong
So pass the apple and give me a bite
My resistance is low and I just can't fight it
I don't think I can ask you to leave
So pass the apple Eve
You make me reach out for more girl
I'm really coming alive
But you better think what you're doing
Before you get us both satisfied
So pass the apple and give me a bite
My resistance is low and I just can't fight it
Now I know I can't ask you to leave
So pass the apple Eve
I can't leave you alone
Give me a bite I just can't fight it
Pass the apple and give me a bite
My resistance is low and I just can't fight it
Now I know I don't want you to leave
So pass the apple Eve
I'm gonna do all the things for you
A girl wants a man to do
I'll sacrifice for you
I'll even do wrong too
You with love and affection
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
My love is strong you see
I know you'll never get tired of me
To try my best to get you hooked
Every night every day
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me yeah
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I see the sunlight in her hair
I feel the warm smile that she wears
She has no recipe for love
And I just can't get enough
From the distance of my mind
To wake up to my destiny
It's time to face reality
It's only love that I feel inside
But I'll get by somehow
I tell myself that it's not real
There's nothing left for me to feel
I'll just be going on my way
Tomorrow brings another day
It's only love that I feel inside
But I've got to be strong
It's only love but I know I'll get by
I'll take my heart and pride and just throw them aside
Ever had a love as sweet as my love
For nowhere in the world
Could there be a boy as true as you love
You give gladly to me
Oh why should it be that
We go on hurting each other
We go on hurting each other
Making each other cry
Without ever knowing why
Close than the leaves
I could love only you
You could love only me
Oh why should it be that
We go on hurting each other
We go on hurting each other
Making each other cry
Without ever knowing why
Can't we stop hurting each other
Gotta stop hurting each other
Making each other cry
Breaking each other's heart
If you would come into my life again
I would never hurt you like I did you then
So satisfied to live again
I know my face would wear smile again
And when I feel your touch I'd hear my heart begin
To start beating inside
I can't count the ways that I missed you
How much I've wanted to kiss you
Girl you know that you're still in my soul
You're the only hope left in this world I have
So won't you say that you love me
One look at you is all I need
To bring breath back to me
So won't you take me by the hand
Let's make love destiny
That's what I thought
I don't know that I will
But until I can find me
And won't play games behind me
I know it's been done
I don't know that I will
But until I can find me
And won't play games behind me
I don't know that I will
But until I can find me
And won't play games behind me
For you and your new love
To have dinner on the ground
For you and your new love
To share the new love that you've found
On you and your new love
I'll be seeing you again
She woke us all up with a terrible scream.
And hate your neighbor for the shade of his skin.
And mommy and daddy are who's to blame.
And I wake up in the morning
With my hair down in my eyes and she says hi
And I stumble to the breakfast table
And she reaches out and takes my hand and squeezes it
And see my morning sun.
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summer time.
And there's no such thing as Dr. Seuss
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summer time.
I think about her face and go and ease my mind.
Meet me and maybe we can grab a bite to eat.
And she drops what she's doing
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes.
Raindrops are falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
So I just did me some talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
He's sleeping on the job
But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Just smile when I fall
The world will still be turning
Without you life goes on
And spring will be returning
Each year though you're gone
I won't show the tear
I'll hide all my fears
And even though I try
And still pretend that I
Don't need your warmth
Don't need your touch
That I know I can't keep you for good
And I'm not even sure that I should
If you must leave my life
You'll leave me alone
Before you leave my life
Be sure to have your own
Somewhere in my mouth
Forever is so very long
I don't want your life to go wrong
If you must leave my life
Before you leave my life
Be sure you have your heart
Now consider every part
Girl be sure to have your heart
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Be sure you have your heart
Kinda hard to love a guy like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better that your own kin did
From the very start it's my own fault
What happens to my heart
You see I've always known you'd go
So you just do what you gotta do
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss
Those sweet lips again
Find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can
Now I know it'll make you feel sad
And make you feel so bad
They say you don't treat me me like you should
They got ways to make you feels no good
I guess they got no way to know
I've had my eyes wide open from the start
The part of you that they'll never see
Is the part you've shown to me
So you just do what you gotta do
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss
Those sweet lips again
Find that dappled dream of yours
Have you any mail today
I've been waiting for a letter
I've tried to reach her every way
She's way down in New Orleans
And Boston's so far away
Funny how we met in Georgia
It had to be my lucky day
Well I had her name and number
Written down in my little red book
But when my plane flew in back home
It wasn't there when I took a look
I know I searched for it everywhere
I wonder what shape my mind was in
But all I know I got to see her again
Won't you help me sleep tonight
Won't you bring me just one letter
And everything will be alright
And everything will be alright
People stop and stare
I can't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes
I won't let you leave my love behind
No I won't let you leave
Where have the people gone
Look through the window
Seems like I'm the only one around.
All of the streets are bare
Don't have to wait for a seat at the movie
Plenty of classrooms everyplace
And it looks like we're ready
To give it one more try
This time there'll be no alibi
I just can't help believing
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty morning
And the promise of tomorrow in her eyes
And I just can't help believing
When she's lying close beside me
And my heart beats with the rhythm of her sigh
This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
I just can't help believing
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
That my fingers fold around it like a glove
And I just can't help believing
When she's whispering her magic
And her tears are shining honey sweet with love
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
For more than just a day
Write them and say I'm the kid they used to laugh at
Send my picture along with the news
Of all the good things I've done
Nothing good ever would become of me
Let them know just how wrong they all can be
Paste my picture all over the walls
In all the halls of the school I used to go to
I was mixed up and kind of confused
No one around to took the time to find out
What was wrong and to try to understand
Maybe now they'll give kids a helping hand
That's how it really ought to be
Not like the way it was with me
Maybe now they'll give kids a helping hand
I hope to God they cast aside
So I went out and really tried
To make you laugh I'll play the fool for you
Although the people turn and stare
It breaks my heart when you not there
I'll stage a ballet on a tabletop
Command performance finger sized
And though I have no tune my show won't flop
I'll find the music in your eyes
Let your love light shine on me
We'll blow a genie from a cigarette
We'll take a magic carpet ride
You must keep us side by side
Let your love light shine on me
Let your love light shine on me
And needed no one else
Depending only on myself
Crumbling in your hand
You turned me into sand
But stone in love with you
I was a rolling stone
Crumbling in your hand
You turned me into sand
But stone in love with you
Crumbling in your hand
You turned me into sand
But stone in love with you
I'm at the railroad station in st. Paul
But girl I'd love to see you most of all
Ever since the train left Montreal
Thought I'd always love this life I'm living
But now I know I love you most of all
Many times before I know I swore that I'd come home to stay...
But it always seems that foolish dream and trains got in my way
Tomorrow there will be snow in Minnesota
But I won't be around to watch it fall
I'll be heading for that old familiar station...
I miss ya baby... Most of all
It looks like another fall.
Your friends they don't seem to help at all.
Just look up your rainy day man.
You've made a hole much too big to mend.
So go on home and look up your rainy day man.
You can't hide the truth with a happy song.
Just go call up your rainy day man.
Lord none can save you.
It looks like another fall.
Your good friends they don't seem to help at all.
And she's bound to love me some
And she's bound to love me some
Like a circle around the sun
Just to try to take my rest
I was trying to take my rest
But my thoughts they just kept wandering
Like the wild geese in the west
It's gonna shine in my back yard someday
It's gonna shine in my back yard someday
And that wind just bound to rise up
And she's bound to love me some
And she's bound to love me some
Read in the paper nearly day
A happy little home comes up for sale
Because two fools have tried and failed to get along
And ya know that's wrong
A man hurts a woman and a woman hurts a man
And take it with a grain of salt
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all
No love at all is a poor old man
No love at all is a child in the street
And that's a long row to hoe
No love at all is a troubled young girl
And it's a pretty short fall
Now people believe me
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all
Oh you got to believe me
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
Rainy night in Georgia
Such a rainy night in Georgia
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night
Rainy night in Georgia
How many times I wondered
But it still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it or you think of it
I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
A rainy night in Georgia
Such a rainy night in Georgia
You look at me and baby all you see
Baby all that I am is what I symbolize
Have twisted your mind and you turn away
You won't trust what I say and it's tearing me apart
I'm holding out my hand to you
Tell me please what else can I do
Then you came and warmed my soul
I need you everyday to stop my loneliness
Everything that's good for me
This wonderful feeling
When I touch your hand
What a happy thing can be
This wonderful feeling
When I touch your hand
What a happy thing can be
She was just sixteen and all alone
So we grew up together
Now things were bad and she was scared
But whenever I would cry
She'd calm my fears and dry my tears
With a rock and roll lullaby
Sing it sweet and clear
We made it through the lonely days
When mama sang a song
Now I can't recall the words at all
It don't make sense to try
In that rock and roll lullaby
Nothing moves my soul
Like the sound of a good old rock and roll lullaby
Nothing moves my soul
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
All my life I was alone
Didn't think I'd find my part
Now I see there's joy inside your arms
Every day I searched for the star
That never was in the sky
And now I see this star is on earth
And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that I would be
If I gave you a chance to come inside my life
And I am happier than the morning sun
And that's the way it will always be
That's the way it will always be
Ever since the day you came inside of my life
And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
Bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
Happier than the morning sun
That's the way you said it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the stars above
That's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside of my life
I believe that everyone should be
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
These boots ain't traveled through
And I'm losing all my heart
But the point of no returning
Something feels mighty wrong
First you came to own my body
Now you're out to get my soul
And I can't tell which is you
And I only have the hope of feeling free
Everybody's calling out directions
Now I never had a mind
That took too kindly to direction
But lately I don't know
Are you anywhere bound
Does a man have to admit he's lost
Before he can be found
When the miles keep rolling by
And he's scared and he don't know why
Does he come right out and shout
Or does he let his roads
When I wake up in the morning feeling like
And the day comes crashing down around about the time my feet hit the floor
There ain't nothing I know
Laced with sweet cherry wine
And I recall that I ain't got a one
And I fell so doggone bored
Lord that dying sounds like it could be fun
There ain't nothing I know
Laced with sweet cherry wine
When I'm going to pot
Just give me a shot of sweet cherry wine
I just can't do without it
There ain't no doubt about it
That nothing can warm up
With sweet cherry wine
This cold heart of mine
I said sweet cherry wine
We thought our little flight would never end
I knew you were my friend
Were chasing after wooden airplanes
And yes I guess I've done some bad
I think I've gone completely mad
If the story of my life
That was the finest time
That was the finest time
He makes love to her every night
And you know this ain't no lie
She makes love in the afternoon
He comes in saying where ya been
She just look him in the eye
She says you can get everything you need
It's a fine way to go
For just a little while
It's a fine way to go
If anyone asks ya how you know
You just tell them I told you so
Well Sidewalk Joe he lives alone
And he waits till the sun goes down
So he can slip out on the streets
Well he sits on the side
Hoping that when the lights go down
Ya know Old Joe really gets off at the movie
It's a fine way to go
For just a little while
It's a fine way to go
If anyone asks ya how you know
You just tell them I told you so oh
It's a fine way to go
For just a little while
It's a fine way to go
If anyone asks ya how you know
Tears don't fit your face
They don't fit your act somehow
Till you find someone who's glad to tag along
And you'll be just as happy
And I'll be just as gone
Go and wash your streaming eyes
Pull yourself back together
Tighten it up and realize
It was never your style to beg a man to stay
So don't tell me that we'll never get along
And I'll be just as gone
Just as gone as the summer when it's snowing
Just as gone as the wind when it ain't blowing
That you're only hanging on
I'm just as good as gone
So stop your carrying on
Stop your carrying on
If I saw a woman that looked a lot like you
And if I thought this woman
Oh but there's not another you
If she had eyes like you do and she knew how to smile
And if I thought the feeling
Oh but there's not another you
I'm staring loneliness face to face
There's no one around
No one around that can take your place
If I thought this woman could make me feel that fine
I'd wrap me up in her love
Oh but there's not another you
Oh but there's not another you
Your eyes are distant
I wonder where you are tonight
Haven't heard a word I said
What's inside your head
I never thought you were dreaming
Or is it there's so much between us
Have we changed so much
That we can't find our way
Let's stop pretending
And lay it on the line
There's no telling what we'll find
When we closed our eyes
Or maybe tomorrow seems so far today
Have we changed so much
That we can't find our way
Are we too far off this base
And find the pieces that are scattered on the ground
Where are we headed for
What's happening to you and I
Sometimes I wake up and the dark of night is creeping
And the early morning hush is all around
I wonder if any of my dreams are worth keeping
Or are they as foolish as they sound
There's so little time
And so many treasures to be found
Maybe someday I'll find myself a warm bed to sleep in
Then the early morning hush won't get me down
There's so little time
And so many treasures to be found
Maybe someday I'll find myself a warm bed to sleep in
Then the early morning hush won't get me down
Maybe someday I'll find myself a warm bed to sleep in
Then the early morning hush won't get me down
It slips away before ya know it's gone
Ya build up walls and before ya know it
Someone moves you and you want to show it
I've been alone too long
Baby now don't you see
I've been alone too long
That's all that's wrong with me
I want to build you a dream
Write you a beautiful song
I've been alone too long
And tell yourself your wounds are healing
When all you've done is turn the pain inside
And when your sure no one can get to ya
Someone smiles and it goes right through ya
I've been alone too long
Baby now don't you see
I've been alone too long
That's all that's wrong with me
I want to build you a dream
Write you a beautiful song
I've been alone too long
I've been alone too long
I've been alone too long
I've been alone too long
It's such a beautiful day
That the sky seems to say good morning
Mister dust off your shoes
Throw away all your blues
Take a good look around
There's no clouds looking down
Sunday sunrise shining through my window pane
Chasing away my cares with all the pouring rain
Sunday sunrise unfolding like a smile
Making me feel just like a new born baby child
Well I'm feeling so good
I keep knocking on wood
I hear birds everywhere
Singing songs in the air with a meaning
Get a whole new outlook
And come on out where it's warm
Sunday sunrise shining through my window pane
Chasing away my cares with all the pouring rain
Sunday sunrise unfolding like a smile
Making me feel just like a new born baby child
Sunday sunrise shining through my window pane
Chasing away my cares with all the pouring rain
Sunday sunrise unfolding like a smile
Now your Father has told you
For something to believe
The realities of power
Are above your ideals
And he sure has good reasons
For the way that he feels
For man has never hesitated
And take more than he needs
Can there be any doubt
To the size of his crimes
After all that we've seen
Oh but what kind of logic
In what kind of brain
Would think it was sane
And what heart that beats
Would chose to kill millions
For an honorable peace
There are those who will argue
You must live past the present
As if the peasant in the fields
Hearing planes in the sky
Waits for history to tell him
Now I'm sorry that you have to hear
They're not pleasant to sing
They're not pleasant to write
I know the tide of protest
Has passed us somehow
Oh but when do you speak out
If you don't speak out now
In what kind of brain
Would think it was sane
And what heart that beats
Would chose to kill millions
For an honorable peace
In what kind of brain
Would think it was sane
In what heart that beats
Would chose to kill millions
For an honorable peace
In what kind of brain
Would think it was sane
In what heart that beats
Would chose to kill millions
And I'm too tired to go for your show
And she started to explain
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues
Just make me lay back and grin like a monkey
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues
Just make me lay back and grin like a monkey
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues
It's enough to make it light in the dark
It's enough to make a bite just a bark
It's enough to make a body move around
It's enough to make a rabbit hug a hog
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues
Just make me lay back and grin like a monkey
Play something I can understand
City on a Sunday morning
Everybody's gone away
Seems to me I like it best that way
Standing on an empty corner
Caught up in a very funny mood today
Footsteps on the sidewalk
6 AM the sun is peeking through
Lazy alley cat is sleeping
Whiling the time away
There's something about a city
That's why I love Sunday
The streets are all rolled up empty
I'm strolling down old Broadway
Sure looks like a peaceful town today
A hobo tips his hat good morning
And I tossed him a dime
On a city morning feeling fine
That's why I love Sunday
City on a Sunday morning
Everybody's gone away
Seems to me I like it best that way
Standing on an empty corner
Caught up in a very funny mood today
There's something about a city
There's something about a city
But I can't get through
You used to be my friend
And I don't really know how it happened
And I don't really know what to say
I just wonder how we ever got this way
That's what it's all about
Why can't we talk it out
And say what's on our minds
So much we need to say
And I don't really know how it happened
But I don't understand
How we ever let it get so out of hand
Things that we've done and said
And I don't really know how it happened
And I don't really know what to say
But I can't bring myself
Wish I was the Superman
I'd write all the news today
And my feet they wanna dance
But I ain't got a chance
If I'm gonna have to wait forever
Well it might as well be never
I said I don't have a chance
And every door leads right back to the fog
And my feet they wanna dance
But I ain't got a chance
If I'm gonna have to wait forever
Well it might as well be never
I said I don't have a chance
Am I gonna have to wait forever
Well it might as well be never
Met the girl that I want to get to know a little better
Tonight I'm gonna take her to the picture show
Gonna park in the darkest spot I know
That I never asked anybody else before
Love me all of my life
Don't wanna grow old without ya
Don't wanna be out in the cold without ya
Been saving my good times for the good
Would you hold me and never ever let me go
I've been told about love for so long
Been left cold without love for so long
Told of disappointments all so wrong
Without you beside me
Love me all of my life
Don't wanna grow old without ya
Don't wanna be out in the cold without ya
Been saving my good times for the good
Would you hold me and never ever let me go
Been saving my good times for the good
Would you hold me and never ever let me go
Love me all of my life
Don't wanna grow old without ya
Don't wanna be out in the cold without ya
Been saving my good times for the good
Would you hold me and never ever let me go
Been saving my good times for the good
Sitting at the stage door of the Palace
Looking down the alley two ways
One way takes my mind back home to Alice
The other to my ballyhoo days
There was a time my name had swept the nation
I wonder how much living I have wasted
Clinging to my ballyhoo days
God almighty when I go
Please let me go dancing ...
I've seen life from both sides of the curtain
And the only life for me is the stage
But nowadays my work is more uncertain
And filled with dreams of ballyhoo days
God almighty when I go
Please let me go dancing ...
I don't want to read the paper this morning
I don't want to hear no busy city sounds
There's so many things that's so much more important
Why don't go somewhere and love
It's been a long long time
Why don't we just go somewhere and love
And lock the world outside
We don't need a reason or a rhyme
Don't take the time to stop and think about it
If we talk too much we might just change our mind
So why don't we go somewhere and love
And leave it all behind
Why don't we just go somewhere and love
And stay a long long time
Why don't we go somewhere and love
And leave it all behind
Why don't we just go somewhere and love
The morning sun woke me
I felt the warmth of soft skin beneath my hand
Last night the devil got to me
And today I'm just a common man
So I'll get up and say goodbye
On my way home I'll make up the lie
That holds our lives together one more time
This is the last time
There's not a soul I know around
They said this town's a waste of time
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
I got my pills to ease the pain
Can't find a thing to ease the rain
I'd love to try and settle down
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Yeah they say the blues
I wouldn't know I haven't been there yet
Got the sunshine above me
The rent note is spent
And I don't know if I'll find a way
And we're happy together
Now I don't know much about tomorrow
I only know that I love you today
And we're happy together
And we're happy together
Now it take much to make me happy
Most times a smile from you will do
As long as I know you'll keep on loving me
I know that I'll get by
That'll see me through
If this is how it feels to be satisfied
And we're happy together
And we're happy together
And we're happy together
It's lonely out tonight
And the feeling just got right for a brand new love song
Somebody done somebody wrong song
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
So sad that it makes everybody cry
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
So sad that it makes everybody cry
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
I could smile for a while
And then I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say hello
As you wished me well
You couldn't tell that
But it's true oh so true
I love you even more than I did before
For you don't love me
And from this moment on
City boys singing country songs
And they tell you what they've seen
City boys singing country songs
But they don't know what they mean
How can a boy from Philly tell ya
How it feels it feels to be in the arms
And how can a New Yorker born and raised
Taste the taste of the popcorn
City boys wearing western blue jeans
Walking down the streets
Just a shining on their feet
What good will blue jeans do ya
If you ain't gonna roll around
In the Mississippi mud awhile
And how will the boots come in that handy
If the dandy don't wanna walk across an Iowa cornfield
City boys singing country songs
And they tell you what they've seen
City boys singing country songs
But they don't know what they mean
Now how can a boy from Philly tell ya
How it feels it feels to be in the arms
And how can a New Yorker born and raised
Taste the taste of the popcorn
I flash back and think about
The time I first found you
You took me in just as I was
And made me feel brand new
And though it wasn't long ago
At times it's hard to believe
It really actually happened
I remember oh so clear
When you came here in my heart
I remember that old me
And doubt if I can keep it up
Till I go back and see
The first time that you found me
You must have known love well
Or maybe you were love itself
At the time I couldn't tell
Now I finally found out
I remember oh so clear
When you came here in my heart
I remember oh so clear
Now I finally found out
I remember oh so clear
You were there to catch me
You were there to catch me
The paper moon I was reaching for
Was never really there
And you were there to catch me
When I fell into your love
When you came my sadness
Your love gave me something
My life was broken and shattered
But you made the pieces fall right in place
And you were there to catch me
When I fell into your love
Your arms were open wide
You never turned your back on me
And never said goodbye
And you were there to catch me
But now you're right beside me
When I need your love
Life a leaf I was surely falling
And you were the ground
You were there to catch me
When I fell into your love
You were there to catch me
When I fell into your love
You were there to catch me
When I fell into your love
You were there to catch me
When I fell into your love
You were there to catch me
When I fell into your love
You were there to catch me
I've had peace and I've had joy
Every since I found you
And everyday is full of hope
Now that I'm around you
You bring to me storybook reality
Storybook realities are what you to me
You took my rusty dreams and made them new
Storybook realities are what I live each day
You're a way of life to me
You know all my problems
You bring to me storybook reality
Storybook realities are what you to me
You took my rusty dreams and made them new
Storybook realities are what I live each day
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
I've lived down in a valley
You live on that mountain above
And although we live in different places
The common ground we share is love
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
If we met as total strangers
And if we came from different lands
And if we didn't speak the same language
Love's one thing we both would understand
Because love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
They say that heavens pretty
And living here is too
But if they said that I would
Have to choose between the two
And sometimes when I'm dreaming
It comes as no surprise
That if you look and see
The homesick feeling in my eyes
While I'm here I'll serve him gladly
And sing him all my songs
And when I'm feeling lonely
And when I'm feeling blue
It's such a joy to know that
I am only passing through
And one day I'll be sleeping
When death knocks on my door
And I'll awake and find
That I'm not homesick anymore
I don't know how long I'll be here
And where He leads I will go with Him
When I hear Him call my name
When it will take place
But it does not matter
If I'm walking in His grace
I feel it won't be long now
Until He comes for me
He's gonna take me with Him
And at His feet I'll bow
We are open please come in
Fill us up with love again
We want to praise you
You have made us what we are
By your blood and by your scars
We want to praise you
Words are so empty and time is so short
To show you how much we love you
On the cross you took our place
Thought we don't deserve your grace
You created everything
Help us worship when we sing
We want to praise you
On the cross you took our place
Thought we don't deserve your grace
On the cross you took our place
Somethings bound to go wrong
But she looks in my eyes
Everything will turn out alright
Each morning I awake and fine
The sunlight softly shining in her hair
And then I realize that I'm only
There's magic in her eyes
That makes me come alive
Everything will turn out alright
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you
Baby nothing could go wrong with you
Oh what she does to me
When she makes love to me
Everything will turn out alright
It's funny how love goes
But honey my loves grows
Even though there's no reason to doubt
You keep saying it's wrong
Neither one of us is free
Still I wanna hold on
When even a fool would let go
Even a child would say no
When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now is it wise holding you
When even a fool would let go
My love had no reason
Like the words to a song that don't rhyme
I just know that it's there all the time
I can believe that's wrong
Makes me want to hold on
When even a fool would let go
Even a child would say no
When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now is it wise holding you
When even a fool would let go
Tell me now is it wise holding you
Met you on a springtime day
Lady when you looked my way
I had a strange sensation
That it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Oh I wake up in the night
But instead I find someone
Who believed in me when I said I'd always care
Oh it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
So I lived my life in a dream world
For the rest of my days
Oh I guess that's all that it would ever be
Wish I had a time machine I could
Make myself go back until the day I was born
And I would live my life again
And rearrange it so that I'd be yours from now on
Oh it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Oh it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
He's the hand on my shoulder
When I need to know someone cares
He's the hand on my shoulder
Assuring me that He's always there
He's the voice in the silence
That sounds so sweet and so clear
He's the voice in the silence
Telling me that He's always near
So there's no need for me to worry
When things aren't going quite so smooth
He will always see me through
He's the light in the darkness
Shining through bright as day
He's the light in the darkness
Guiding me each step of the way
He's the hand on my shoulder
When I need to know someone cares
He's the hand on my shoulder
There's a gap in the world
And we can bridge that gap
We'll need help from above
But if everybody pitches in
We can build a bridge of love
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
From nation to nation
Standing through each generation
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
That's what it's gonna take
Then one day we'll cross that
Bridge to a better life
And we'll leave behind us
That old world of strife
When we reach our new world
Hate we'll never fear
And I bet if we could see God's face
He'd be smiling from ear to ear
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
From nation to nation
Standing through each generation
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
That's what it's gonna take
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
From nation to nation
Standing through each generation
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
That's what it's gonna take
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
From nation to nation
Standing through each generation
Would wash men's feet
Then turn the other cheek
I want to be more like Him
He was more concerned
I want to be more like Him
I want to be more like Jesus
That's why I've put my life in His hands
I want to be more like Jesus
And with His help I know that I can
Who had him crucified
I want to be more like Him
Everyday in every way
I want to be more like Jesus
That's why I've put my life in His hands
I want to be more like Jesus
And with His help I know that I can
I want to be more like Jesus
That's why I've put my life in His hands
I was lost as could be
I was caught in a world
Spinning around in misery
You took me in and you touched my heart
With your song of love
You gave me a brand new start
Now there's beautiful music
Flowing all through me
Joy bells ringing inside my head
Since you came inside me
Now I'm lost inside your love
To make me hunger for more of you
And I don't wanna break loose
With my heart in my hand
I'll do what you say to
Just never let me go Lord
I'm so in love with you
Now there's beautiful music
Flowing all through me
Joy bells ringing inside my head
Since you came inside me
Now I'm lost inside your love
Now there's beautiful music
Flowing all through me
Joy bells ringing inside my head
Now there's beautiful music
Flowing all through me
When I die there won't be much
To salvage from my earnings
I never had a lot of land or houses to my name
I've never been a corporate prince
On Madison and New York
I never held a diamond in my hand
But I've seen children laughing
And I've known my Creator
And I've been a happy man
I never really loved the way I saw it in the movies
But I had myself a woman of my own
The place we lived was modest
And we kept the yard together
I never traveled far from my hometown
But I've heard music playing
That made me understand
And touched the hearts of heaven
And I've been a happy man
Life has had it's hard times
When I've felt the chill of winter
I can't forget the night
When my sweet Julie slipped away
But growing old is different
Than I always thought it would be
The sweetness of my youth
Beneath His guiding hand
And knowing soon I'll see Him
Has made me a happy man
And knowing soon I'll see Him
What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh what a difference you've made in my life
What a change you have made in my heart
What a change you have made in my heart
You've replaced all the broken parts
Oh what a change you have made in my heart
Love to me was just a word in a song
And then way over you
But now I join in the singing
That's why I want to spread the news
What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh what a difference you've made
What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh what a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh what a difference you've made
What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
He's got it all in control
He's got it all in control
He's put that reassurance
He's got it all in control
I've put my life in His hands
I've put my life in His hands
So every road I walk down
I'm sure is in His plan
He holds the stars in the sky
He holds the land back from the sea
If He can do all of that
Surely he can take care
He's got it all in control
He's got it all in control
He's put that reassurance
He's got it all in control
He's got it all in control
God's got it all in control
He's put that reassurance
He's got it all in control
He's got it all in control
God's got it all in control
He's got it all in control
God's got it all in control
For the flowers that grow
There would be nothing I know
For the sun in the sky
I'm so grateful that I
For the rivers that flow
There would be nothing I know
And the songs that we sing
And the joy that You bring
I have nothing to fear
As long as I have You here
For the birds in the trees
I am down on my knees
For the rain and the snow
There would nothing I know
For all the mountains
That You give us to climb
Yeah I say one more time
I have nothing to fear
As long as I have You here
As long as I have You here
Lost and feeling lonely
I was always glad to see a day go by
The darkness just got deeper
The mountains just got steeper
But when I heard the Word it changed my life
It gently touched my heart and changed my life
And I could never thank You enough
Loved and feeling worth it
I want to share this happiness I've found
You're the song I'm singing
You give my life meaning
That's why I want to spread the Word around
It gently touched my heart and changed my life
And I could never thank You enough
It gently touched my heart and changed my life
I heard about it raining on a Georgia night
Never saw clearly in the morning light
She was a rainy day woman
Took my soul and I soon discovered
Everybody loves a rain song
Cause everybody's been rained on
It's like a shoulder you can lean on
Everybody loves a rainbow
From San Francisco to Chicago
And no matter where I go
It's still raining in my heart
When your memories get too cloudy to see
She was a rainy day woman
Took my soul and I soon discovered
Everybody loves a rain song
Cause everybody's been rained on
It's like a shoulder you can lean on
Everybody loves a rainbow
From San Francisco to Chicago
And no matter where I go
It's still raining in my heart
Everybody loves a rain song
Cause everybody's been rained on
It's like a shoulder you can lean on
Everybody loves a rainbow
From San Francisco to Chicago
And no matter where I go
An out of town gawkier
I threw in my quarter
Watched it shining in the water
And wished for a southern belle
It must have hypnotized me
Long dress with lace pockets
Around her neck a golden locket
There stood my southern belle
Lay back we're riding on the Blues River
On board the Delta Queen
Paddle wheel steamers
And beautiful dreamers
All the way to New Orleans
And all along the delta night
There's pyramids of cotton
As far as the eye can see
Right now we're strangers
But there's no danger
Lay back we're riding on the Blues River
On board the Delta Queen
Paddle wheel steamers
And beautiful dreamers
All the way to New Orleans
Lay back we're riding on the Blues River
Her majesty the queen
Right now we're strangers
But there's no danger
Lay back we're riding on the Blues River
On board the Delta Queen
Paddle wheel steamers
Using things and loving people
That's the way it's got to be
Using things and loving people
Look around and you can see
That loving things and using people
Using things and loving people
That's the way it's got to be
Being loved is in the giving
All we have is what we share
Loving life is for the living
You have to have a heart to care
And loving things and using people
Using things and loving people
That's the way it's got to be
So put your hand inside my hand
I don't know where the road will lead
We may not find the things we want
But we will find the things we need
And all we need is love
Using things and loving people
Brings you happiness I've found
Using things and loving people
Not the other way around
Using things and loving people
That's the way it's got to be
I see dark clouds coming my way
I know they're gonna try to rain on me
They're almost here but I must say
I'm just as happy as can be
Just because I've got Jesus on my mind
Just because I've got Jesus on my mind
The situation might look so awful grim
But that's when I just stop and get my mind on Him
Just because I've got Jesus on my mind
I see a giant right in my path
I know he's gonna try to do me in
I'm not the least bit afraid of him
Just because I've got Jesus on my mind
Just because I've got Jesus on my mind
The situation might look so awful grim
But that's when I just stop and get my mind on Him
Just because I've got Jesus on my mind
Don't you know I've got Jesus on my mind
Don't you know I've got Jesus on my mind
Don't you know I've got Jesus on my mind
Don't you know I've got Jesus on my mind
Don't you know I've got Jesus on my mind
You gave me love when nobody gave me a prayer.
You gave me love when nobody gave me a prayer.
You gave me love when nobody gave me a prayer.
And helped me start all over again.
I've never seen the Eiffel Tower.
I've never seen the streets of Rome.
But I'll see the greatest wonder that day when I go home.
I'll see him smile open His arms and walk my way
I'm gonna look into His eyes someday
I may not see that much of riches
I may not see that much of fame
My first word will be Daddy
My first step to Your arms
Let me have a baby's charm
Even though the world says I'm a man
You know that I want to grow up
I cry when I get hungry
And when I've disobeyed
Please feed me till I'm older
Then feed me when I'm old
With a brand new thirsty soul
Even though the world says I'm a man
You know that I want to grow up
I need to be still and let God love me
I need to be still and let God love me
When this old world starts to push and shove me
I need to be still and let God love me
I need to relax and let God take over
I need to relax and let God take over
He'll take this load off my shoulders
I need to relax and let God take over
When there's trouble all around me
And my soul cries out for rest
When I feel that I'm falling
Even though I've done my best
When decisions get so heavy
And there are answers that I need
I know it's time to just be still and let
I need to be still and let God love me
I need to be still and let God love me
When this old world starts to push and shove me
I need to be still and let God love me
I need to be still and let God love me
I need to be still and let God love me
When this old world starts to push and shove me
He used to walk this earth
With sandals on His feet
Just to hear Him speak
With His hands He'd heal the sick
And open the eyes that could not see
And just to think that life that lives in Him
Now He's walking in my shoes
He's singing with my voice
He's reaching out with my hands
Helping someone make the right choice
He's smiling with my face
He's showing me the way
And I'm so glad that I can be a part
He's living in my heart
With his voice He'd speak
And calm an angry sea
Yet He said that one day
We'd do greater things than He
He forgave the men that nailed Him to a tree
And just to think that His spirit
Now lives inside of me
Now He's walking in my shoes
He's singing with my voice
He's reaching out with my hands
Helping someone make the right choice
He's smiling with my face
He's showing me the way
And I'm so glad that I can be a part
He's living in my heart
Now He's walking in my shoes
He's singing with my voice
He's reaching out with my hands
Helping someone make the right choice
Now He's smiling with my face
He's showing me the way
And I'm so glad that I can be a part
You laugh and play your part
You fool the world but not your heart
You thought it all would pass in time
The melody and all the rhyme
But still the music starts when she walks by
Some love songs never die
They haunt your memory
The pain will fade and the tears will dry
But some songs will never die
You found someone to take her place
Time may take you many loves apart
Late at night when your alone
And all your thoughts have come and gone
You'll hear her music echo in your heart
Some love songs never die
They haunt your memory
The pain will fade and the tears will dry
But some songs will never die
Some love songs never die
They haunt your memory
And even though you can say goodbye
Fancy shoes that dance in time.
They did sing a gypsy rhyme.
Just a boy of seventeen.
Silver spangles in her eyes.
And the taste of life's sweet wine.
And stir the darkness in my mind.
Little know who haunts my mind.
And it dances in my head.
Slumber softly in their beds.
Silver spangles in her eyes.
And the taste of life's sweet wine.
Silver spangles in her eyes.
As we sit out on the back porch
And the night begins to show
It feels good just to be here and unwind
And the sun is slowly setting
A reflection in your eyes
And when you look my way
The thought that's crossed my mind
And you know there ain't no love
There ain't no love like yours for me
And it's plain my love
You've been heaven sent made specially
There ain't no love like yours for me
And we'll remain in love
With the kind of love
Most lovers never see
You always sit and listen
When I feel the need to talk
When I'm feeling insecure and filled with doubt
You've got the way to make me happy
And it's right there in your smile
And love for me will always be what I can't do without
There ain't no love like yours for me
And it's plain my love
You've been heaven sent made specially
There ain't no love like yours for me
Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk from the hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
Tears from little sister
Without a patch for the party to go
She is living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it in the snow on the ground
Trying to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe let the snow come through
And the chills to the bone
Where you can live in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Living on dreams ain't easy
And the chills stay away
You know that faith is your foundation
Where you can live in the love of the common people
Be the pride in the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Somewhere I heard these words one time
Love is like a clinging vine
I've never had to cling to you
Our love is not a clinging vine
Somewhere I let read these words one time
Love is like a glass of wine
Aging made it sweeter and so fine
It's no better now than before
Our love is not a glass of wine
Let them write their fancy words
For people who have never heard or tasted
A love like yours and mine
Ours is not a clinging vine
And its certainly not a glass of wine
Our love is not a clinging vine
And its certainly not a glass of wine
Somewhere there should be
For all the world to see
A statue of a fool made of stone
Who let love slip through his hands
And then just let him stand there all alone
And there on his face
A gold tear should be placed
To honor the million tears he's cried
And the hurt in his eyes would show
So everyone would know
Concealed is a broken heart inside
All the world can see
Then inscribe The World's Greatest Fool
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a night so long
The moon just went behind a cloud
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a robin weep
That means he's lost the will to live
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
Who's the one who tied you shoe when you were young
And knew just when to come and see what you had done
When you told her your first love was over
She'd met someone older mama mama
Results graduation mama mama
When you introduced you future bride
As you walked down the isle through tears you saw her
This is a story about Billy and Sue
They were as in love as were any two
And yet Billy had to die
And when you hear the reason why
You'll hang your head and cry
Billy and Sue met the first day of school
You'd have to be a fool
This mutual agreement of love and trust
They would travel the road
And when Billy was old enough to take a wife
He was old enough to fight for his country
Sues letters came every day
To fight for his country and the girl he loved
That's a soldiers only pay
But then Billy heard no more from Sue
He was worried sick but what could he do
The bullets were screaming as he hugged the ground
His hope his fate was almost gone
And then like a miracle the letter appeared
Billy tore the letter open and he read dear john
A look came over Billy that would scare a ghost
Familiar look seen on soldiers coast to coast
And even though the air was filled with lead
Billy jumped up they shot him dead
Billy was buried in a far away grave
It read for his country his life he gave
But that epitaph was only a part
Children were laughing then
I could hear a bluebird sing
And the warmth of your arms
Oh the warmth of your arms
And we were walking by the shore
You said you'd marry me
Now I cry but can't you see
These teardrops in my eyes
They're for all we planned
Our whole lives through
Things we'll never do
Things we'll never do
Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Still in love with you
Today I passed you on the street
Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
And he looked so satisfied
And you know he looked so satisfied
It hurts to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss
How much that I miss yeah
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
I'll be in New York City
When the lights shine bright tonight
Where my woman waits for me
Arms that hold me tenderly
Lips as sweet as honeycomb
Love that waits for me alone
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
The eyes of a New York woman
Are eyes that can hold a man
She swept me off of my feet
Made my world seem so complete
I'll never have to look for more
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
Thought I wasn't ready
For the tie that binds
But I lost my heart to her
When her eyes met mine
Now I see her differently
I've got to make her mine
So I'll make my home Fun City
And let the lights shine bright on me
I'll never have to look for more
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
The eyes of a New York woman
Are eyes that can hold a man
She swept me off of my feet
Made my world seem so complete
I'll never have to look for more
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
When you hold me in your arms so tight
That you're in love with me
Lips are sweet as candy
The taste stays on my mind
For another cup of wine
But I don't need a cure
I'll just stay addicted
And hope I can endure
All the good love when we're all alone
That you're in love with me
All the good love when we're all alone
I see the sunlight in her hair
I feel the warm smile that she wears
She has no recipe for love
And I just can't get enough
From the distance of my mind
To wake up to my destiny
It's time to face reality
It's only love that I feel inside
But I'll get by somehow
I tell myself that it's not real
There's nothing left for me to feel
I'll just be going on my way
Tomorrow brings another day
It's only love that I feel inside
But I've got to be strong
It's only love but I know I'll get by
I'll take my heart and pride and just throw them aside
And it's tearing me all up inside
Because I like what you're doing
And it's something I've never tried
You're tempting me to come on strong
And when I look in your eyes girl
There's no way to tell right from wrong
So pass the apple and give me a bite
My resistance is low and I just can't fight it
I don't think I can ask you to leave
So pass the apple Eve
You make me reach out for more girl
I'm really coming alive
But you better think what you're doing
Before you get us both satisfied
So pass the apple and give me a bite
My resistance is low and I just can't fight it
Now I know I can't ask you to leave
So pass the apple Eve
I can't leave you alone
Give me a bite I just can't fight it
Pass the apple and give me a bite
My resistance is low and I just can't fight it
Now I know I don't want you to leave
So pass the apple Eve
Raindrops are falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
So I just did me some talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
He's sleeping on the job
But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Where have the people gone
Look through the window
Seems like I'm the only one around.
All of the streets are bare
Don't have to wait for a seat at the movie
Plenty of classrooms everyplace
And it looks like we're ready
To give it one more try
This time there'll be no alibi
I just can't help believing
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty morning
And the promise of tomorrow in her eyes
And I just can't help believing
When she's lying close beside me
And my heart beats with the rhythm of her sigh
This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
I just can't help believing
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
That my fingers fold around it like a glove
And I just can't help believing
When she's whispering her magic
And her tears are shining honey sweet with love
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
For more than just a day
I'm at the railroad station in st. Paul
But girl I'd love to see you most of all
Ever since the train left Montreal
Thought I'd always love this life I'm living
But now I know I love you most of all
Many times before I know I swore that I'd come home to stay...
But it always seems that foolish dream and trains got in my way
Tomorrow there will be snow in Minnesota
But I won't be around to watch it fall
I'll be heading for that old familiar station...
I miss ya baby... Most of all
Read in the paper nearly day
A happy little home comes up for sale
Because two fools have tried and failed to get along
And ya know that's wrong
A man hurts a woman and a woman hurts a man
And take it with a grain of salt
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all
No love at all is a poor old man
No love at all is a child in the street
And that's a long row to hoe
No love at all is a troubled young girl
And it's a pretty short fall
Now people believe me
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all
Oh you got to believe me
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
Been sleeping in your head
Those old dark clouds
Been hanging around your head
But all your hard times
Will vanish in the wind
When the mighty clouds of joy
Let your love seize us
When the mighty clouds of joy
Those old storm clouds
Are slowly drifting by
And those old raindrops
Are fading from your eyes
Gonna shine on us again
When the mighty clouds of joy
Let your love seize us
When the mighty clouds of joy
Won't you let your love seize us
Let us find sweet peace within
When the mighty clouds of joy
Maybe I'll be the things I dream
And not the things I seem
Maybe I'll get to change the world
Just as happy as it seems
Maybe I'll learn to face the truth
And like the truth I face
Maybe I'll get to find myself
Before I'm lost in space
Just as faithful as it seems
Just as faithful as it seems
She was just sixteen and all alone
So we grew up together
Now things were bad and she was scared
But whenever I would cry
She'd calm my fears and dry my tears
With a rock and roll lullaby
Sing it sweet and clear
We made it through the lonely days
When mama sang a song
Now I can't recall the words at all
It don't make sense to try
In that rock and roll lullaby
Nothing moves my soul
Like the sound of a good old rock and roll lullaby
Nothing moves my soul
It's lonely out tonight
And the feeling just got right for a brand new love song
Somebody done somebody wrong song
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
So sad that it makes everybody cry
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
So sad that it makes everybody cry
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
Raindrops are falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
So I just did me some talking to the sun

I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Who's the one who tied you shoe when you were young
And knew just when to come and see what you had done
When you told her your first love was over
She'd met someone older mama mama
Results graduation mama mama
When you introduced you future bride
As you walked down the isle through tears you saw her
She was just sixteen and all alone
So we grew up together
Now things were bad and she was scared
But whenever I would cry
She'd calm my fears and dry my tears
With a rock and roll lullaby
Sing it sweet and clear
We made it through the lonely days
When mama sang a song
Now I can't recall the words at all
It don't make sense to try
In that rock and roll lullaby
Nothing moves my soul
Like the sound of a good old rock and roll lullaby
Nothing moves my soul
Where have the people gone
Look through the window
Seems like I'm the only one around.
All of the streets are bare
Don't have to wait for a seat at the movie
Plenty of classrooms everyplace
And it looks like we're ready
To give it one more try
This time there'll be no alibi
Been sleeping in your head
Those old dark clouds
Been hanging around your head
But all your hard times
Will vanish in the wind
When the mighty clouds of joy
Let your love seize us
When the mighty clouds of joy
Those old storm clouds
Are slowly drifting by
And those old raindrops
Are fading from your eyes
Gonna shine on us again
When the mighty clouds of joy
Let your love seize us
When the mighty clouds of joy
Won't you let your love seize us
Let us find sweet peace within
When the mighty clouds of joy
When you hold me in your arms so tight
That you're in love with me
Lips are sweet as candy
The taste stays on my mind
For another cup of wine
But I don't need a cure
I'll just stay addicted
And hope I can endure
All the good love when we're all alone
That you're in love with me
All the good love when we're all alone
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a night so long
The moon just went behind a cloud
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a robin weep
That means he's lost the will to live
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
Read in the paper nearly day
A happy little home comes up for sale
Because two fools have tried and failed to get along
And ya know that's wrong
A man hurts a woman and a woman hurts a man
And take it with a grain of salt
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all
No love at all is a poor old man
No love at all is a child in the street
And that's a long row to hoe
No love at all is a troubled young girl
And it's a pretty short fall
Now people believe me
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all
Oh you got to believe me
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
I just can't help believing
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty morning
And the promise of tomorrow in her eyes
And I just can't help believing
When she's lying close beside me
And my heart beats with the rhythm of her sigh
This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
I just can't help believing
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
That my fingers fold around it like a glove
And I just can't help believing
When she's whispering her magic
And her tears are shining honey sweet with love
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
For more than just a day
I see the sunlight in her hair
I feel the warm smile that she wears
She has no recipe for love
And I just can't get enough
From the distance of my mind
To wake up to my destiny
It's time to face reality
It's only love that I feel inside
But I'll get by somehow
I tell myself that it's not real
There's nothing left for me to feel
I'll just be going on my way
Tomorrow brings another day
It's only love that I feel inside
But I've got to be strong
It's only love but I know I'll get by
I'll take my heart and pride and just throw them aside
I'm at the railroad station in st. Paul
But girl I'd love to see you most of all
Ever since the train left Montreal
Thought I'd always love this life I'm living
But now I know I love you most of all
Many times before I know I swore that I'd come home to stay...
But it always seems that foolish dream and trains got in my way
Tomorrow there will be snow in Minnesota
But I won't be around to watch it fall
I'll be heading for that old familiar station...
I miss ya baby... Most of all
I'll be in New York City
When the lights shine bright tonight
Where my woman waits for me
Arms that hold me tenderly
Lips as sweet as honeycomb
Love that waits for me alone
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
The eyes of a New York woman
Are eyes that can hold a man
She swept me off of my feet
Made my world seem so complete
I'll never have to look for more
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
Thought I wasn't ready
For the tie that binds
But I lost my heart to her
When her eyes met mine
Now I see her differently
I've got to make her mine
So I'll make my home Fun City
And let the lights shine bright on me
I'll never have to look for more
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
The eyes of a New York woman
Are eyes that can hold a man
She swept me off of my feet
Made my world seem so complete
I'll never have to look for more
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
And Changed my point of view
I can't believe the things
I'm looking forward to
Would you believe I'm thinking about
And a two story house
And too many bills to pay
Too make me happy living that way
I used to play such a game
I'd go looking for love
And hide if it saw me
You could find with my friends
Hanging out on the street
Now they're wondering where I could be
Well it's Saturday night
And it's just you and me
Snuggled up on the couch
Would you believe I'm thinking about
And a two story house
And too many bills to pay
Too make me happy living that way
If we don't get to Paris
It won't break our hearts
We'll just pack up the kids
And go to Yellowstone Park
I want a two car garage
And a two story house
And too many bills to pay
Too make me happy living that way
All I want is you baby
All I want is you baby
All I want is you baby
Somethings bound to go wrong
But she looks in my eyes
Everything will turn out alright
Each morning I awake and fine
The sunlight softly shining in her hair
And then I realize that I'm only
There's magic in her eyes
That makes me come alive
Everything will turn out alright
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you
Baby nothing could go wrong with you
Oh what she does to me
When she makes love to me
Everything will turn out alright
With a heart that's been torn.
From the moment she was born.
But never tears of joy.
Painted heartbreak blue.
Never will come true.
Fell on this little boy.
And made a broken toy.
A broken life takes its place.
That one day will break toys of its own.
Give back the innocence stolen from them.
A broken life takes its place.
That one day will break toys of its own.
Early this morning I opened my eyes
And caught you watching me sleep
I'm getting new looks from an old lover again
Was written all over your face
I'm getting new looks from an old lover again
It's such a good feeling
Knowing I that I can still win what I've already won
It's great to know we still can be lovers and friends
It's such a good feeling
Knowing it's better than I ever thought it could be
Because of new looks from an old lover again
I feel your fingers touching my body and mind
As they brush through my hair
I'm getting news looks from an old lover again
And deep in your eyes I see the hunger
That only true love can feed
I'm getting new looks from an old lover again
It's such a good feeling
Knowing I that I can still win what I've already won
It's great to know we still can be lovers and friends
It's such a good feeling
Knowing it's better than I ever thought it could be
Because of new looks from an old lover again
Two broken hearts lonely looking like houses where nobody lives
Two people both having so much pride inside
Neither side forgives
Angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
It's my belief pride is the chief cause
In the number of husbands and wives.
Two broken hearts lonely looking like houses where nobody lives

Neither side forgives
Angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
It's my belief pride is the chief cause
In the number of husbands and wives.
It's my belief pride is the chief cause
We live in the modern age
Where love is fast like a turning page
The friends we used to know
Like the times we've had
Whatever happened to old fashioned love
The kind that would see you through
The kind of love my Momma and Daddy knew
The kind that would last through the years
Today is all we've planned
We say tomorrow we'll understand
The kind that would see you through
The kind of love my Momma and Daddy knew
The kind that would last through the years
For now the tenderness
And it's hard to find
The kind that would see you through
The kind of love my Momma and Daddy knew
The kind that would last through the years
When you hold me in your arms so tight
That you're in love with me
Lips are sweet as candy
The taste stays on my mind
For another cup of wine
But I don't need a cure
I'll just stay addicted
And hope I can endure
All the good love when we're all alone
That you're in love with me
All the good love when we're all alone
Raindrops are falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
So I just did me some talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
He's sleeping on the job
But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Kinda hard to love a guy like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better that your own kin did
From the very start it's my own fault
What happens to my heart
You see I've always known you'd go
So you just do what you gotta do
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss
Those sweet lips again
Find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can
Now I know it'll make you feel sad
And make you feel so bad
They say you don't treat me me like you should
They got ways to make you feels no good
I guess they got no way to know
I've had my eyes wide open from the start
The part of you that they'll never see
Is the part you've shown to me
So you just do what you gotta do
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss
Those sweet lips again
Find that dappled dream of yours
I'm at the railroad station in st. Paul

You look at me and baby all you see
Baby all that I am is what I symbolize
Have twisted your mind and you turn away
You won't trust what I say and it's tearing me apart
I'm holding out my hand to you
Tell me please what else can I do
Where have the people gone
Look through the window
Seems like I'm the only one around.
All of the streets are bare
Don't have to wait for a seat at the movie
Plenty of classrooms everyplace

Been sleeping in your head
Those old dark clouds
Been hanging around your head
But all your hard times
Will vanish in the wind
When the mighty clouds of joy
Let your love seize us
When the mighty clouds of joy
Those old storm clouds
Are slowly drifting by
And those old raindrops
Are fading from your eyes
Gonna shine on us again
When the mighty clouds of joy
Let your love seize us
When the mighty clouds of joy
Won't you let your love seize us
Let us find sweet peace within
When the mighty clouds of joy
Maybe I'll be the things I dream
And not the things I seem
Maybe I'll get to change the world
Just as happy as it seems
Maybe I'll learn to face the truth
And like the truth I face
Maybe I'll get to find myself
Before I'm lost in space
Just as faithful as it seems
Just as faithful as it seems
She was just sixteen and all alone
So we grew up together
Now things were bad and she was scared
But whenever I would cry
She'd calm my fears and dry my tears
With a rock and roll lullaby
Sing it sweet and clear
We made it through the lonely days
When mama sang a song
Now I can't recall the words at all
It don't make sense to try
In that rock and roll lullaby
Nothing moves my soul
Like the sound of a good old rock and roll lullaby
Nothing moves my soul
These boots ain't traveled through
And I'm losing all my heart
But the point of no returning
Something feels mighty wrong
First you came to own my body
Now you're out to get my soul
And I can't tell which is you
And I only have the hope of feeling free
Everybody's calling out directions
Now I never had a mind
That took too kindly to direction
But lately I don't know
Are you anywhere bound
Does a man have to admit he's lost
Before he can be found
When the miles keep rolling by
And he's scared and he don't know why
Does he come right out and shout
Or does he let his roads
When I wake up in the morning feeling like
And the day comes crashing down around about the time my feet hit the floor
There ain't nothing I know
Laced with sweet cherry wine
And I recall that I ain't got a one
And I fell so doggone bored
Lord that dying sounds like it could be fun
There ain't nothing I know
Laced with sweet cherry wine
When I'm going to pot
Just give me a shot of sweet cherry wine
I just can't do without it
There ain't no doubt about it
That nothing can warm up
With sweet cherry wine
This cold heart of mine
I said sweet cherry wine
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
All my life I was alone
Didn't think I'd find my part
Now I see there's joy inside your arms
Every day I searched for the star
That never was in the sky
And now I see this star is on earth
And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that I would be
If I gave you a chance to come inside my life
And I am happier than the morning sun
And that's the way it will always be
That's the way it will always be
Ever since the day you came inside of my life
And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
Bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
Happier than the morning sun
That's the way you said it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the stars above
That's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside of my life
I believe that everyone should be
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
You say you've found somebody new but that won't stop my loving you
I just can't let you walk away forget the love I had for you
Yes I could find somebody too but I don't want no one but you
How can you leave without regret am I that easy to forget
Before you leave be sure you find you want his love much more than mine
Yes I could find somebody too but I don't want no one but you
How could you leave without regret you're not that easy to forget
Show me that smile again
We're nowhere near the end
The best is ready to begin
I look into your eyes and see them shining out
Holding you close this way
Is like having summer everyday
As long as we got each other
We can take anything that comes our way
Promise me here and now
Will never come between us
As long as we got each other
We can take anything that comes our way
As long as we got each other
We can take anything that comes our way
The best is ready to begin
We can take anything that comes our way
They held up as long as they could
All those people at my feet
I was so smug in my prime
Up at the height of my conceit
I got my back up against the wall
You know this ain't the first time
I got my back up against the wall
It's been a long fight
I didn't know I'd have to make no
It's gonna be more than I can take now baby
I thought I'd never fall
I got my back up against the wall
I got my back against the wall
Sometimes I find myself with my back against the wall
I got my back against the wall
Just like a lot of good people now
They love me all around the world
I can't understand you girl
I wonder why the pure in heart
And I wonder what the Lord has made
Now that he plans to throw away
I thought I would never fall
I got my back against the wall
Sometimes you find yourself down on the street
I got my back against the wall
Sometimes no matter how hard you try
I got my back against the wall
Last night I started to cry
And I cried all night long
I got my back against the wall
Last night I started to pray
And I prayed all night long
And that's when I got that feeling y'all
It's just a part of life
Bad news travels like wildfire
Good news travels slow
They call me old wildfire
Always getting into trouble
And leaving little girls who hate to see me go
I picked peaches down in Georgia
Lumber jacked up in Maine
I've been hired and fired and jailed
In every state you can name
Always getting into trouble
And leaving little girls who hate to see me go
The stories is the same
From one state to the other
I have to change my name
Always getting into trouble
And leaving little girls who hate to see me go
Now they tried to hang me down in Oakland
And they did in San Frisco
And I broke their rope
And they had to let me go
Always getting into trouble
And leaving little girls who hate to see me go
I see hard times coming
I'd never leave you behind
I hear rumors spreading
Now we've got to stand together
With our hearts again
I see a brand new Heaven
Our love will live forever
Our love will live forever
Our love will live forever
Our love will live forever
Our love will live forever
Our love will live forever
Our love will live forever
Our love will live forever
Our love will live forever
Of life's ups and down
The downs have been few
I guess you could say
That it's all because of you
If anyone should ever write my life story
For whatever reason there might
Between each line of pain and glory
That ever happened to me
That ever happened to me
That I've spent hurrying
If anyone should ever write my life story
For whatever reason there might
Between each line of pain and glory
That ever happened to me
Oh you're the best thing
That ever happened to me
I know you're the best thing
I never knew I could be so sad
Since you been gone from me
I've had nothing but misery
I know I could search this whole wide world
But I'd never find another girl like
I still see Bobbie's face
I feel her warm embrace
Even though she's far away
And there she'll stay
I still can remember that very day
Bobbie turned around and she walked away
Leaving me standing there with a broken heart
Never giving me a reason why we should part
Please come back just one more time
Hang out with the new kids
You were born again today
You were born again today
Hang out with the new kids
You were born again today
You were born again today
Hang out with the new kids
You were born again today
You were born again today
Hang out with the new kids
You were born again today
As a child I never stopped believing
The joy that filled our house on Christmas Day
By the fire we loved to share the meaning
With songs we sang all through the holiday
The one of peace on earth for everyone
No matter where you are you're not alone
Love will find you in December
By the tree we welcomed back the memory
To talk about how fast the year's gone by
So blessed seeing all the family
The one that keeps the Christmas dream alive
No matter where you are you're not alone
Love will find you in December
When the trees are covered up with snow
In your heart you'll know it's time to go home
No matter where you are you're not alone
Love will find you in December
Didn't it rain children
Talk about rain oh my Lord
Didn't it fall didn't it fall
Didn't it fall my Lord didn't it rain
Didn't it rain children
Talk about rain oh my Lord
Didn't it fall didn't it fall
Didn't it fall my Lord didn't it rain
Oh it rained forty days
And it rained forty nights
There was no land no where in sight
God send the angel to spread the news
He haste his wings and away he flew
To the East to the West
To the North to the South
All day all night how it rained how it rained
Didn't it rain children
Talk about rain oh my Lord
Didn't it fall didn't it fall
Didn't it fall my Lord didn't it rain
Some at the window some at the door
Some said Noah can't you take a little more
No no said Noah no no my friends
The nature got to keep you can't get in
I told you I told you a long time ago
You wouldn't hear me you disobey me
Lord send the angel a warning to you
It began to rain and now you are through
Well it rained forty days
Forty nights without stopping
When the rain stopped dropping
Knock at the window knock at the door
Can't you take any more
No no my brothers you are full of sin
God has the key you can't get in
Would you listen how it rained
Didn't it rain children
Talk about rain oh my Lord
Didn't it fall didn't it fall
Didn't it fall my Lord didn't it rain
Didn't it rain children
Talk about rain oh my Lord
Didn't it fall didn't it fall
It was the hottest day of August
All of us were down by the banks of the Paint Rock River
I was next in line to be baptized
At the innocent age of ten
And I'll never forget I remember it yet
The taste of that clear pure water
And that preacher's words still fill my head
And I hear them now and then he said
Do you wanna go to heaven
And I said yeah just lead me on
Take my hand can you feel that feeling
And I said yes just lead me on
It was the hottest day of summer
And our final high school dance was just about over
I was old enough for the taste of love
When boys turn into men
And I'll never forget I remember it yet
The taste of that clear pure water
But the preacher's words I barely heard
As sweet Bonnie Lou gave in she said
It was a lonely night in August
She was sitting at the end of the bar when I saw her
And with a little wine and an little time
She would be a prize to win
Now I'll never forget I remember it yet
The taste of that clear pure water
But that preacher's words could not be heard
Won't you give me an appointment
Been so long since I've had a check up
I know there's a long line waiting
Can you tell me is he in today
Show me to the man with the healing hands
And tell him to come and take me by my hand
Can you forgive me for the way I've been living
Taking more than giving
I'm just tired of living this way
Show me that road to salvation
And lead me away from temptation
And close the door to hate
I thought I'd see you smile
When I walked in the door
Thought those arms of yours would be open wide
The way they were before
Why do you look at me
Like I'm some stranger now
When you used to hold me so tight
Don't you love me anymore
Have your learned to live your life without me
When did the fire go out
Where did the feeling go
Did it slip away when I wasn't there
Baby now I've come home
I thought you'd want me babe
I was so sure you'd ask me to to stay
I thought you'd need this too
Guess it didn't work out that way
Don't you love me anymore
Have you learned to live your life without me
Don't you love me anymore
When did the fire go out
Where did the feeling go
When you used to hold me so close baby
Don't you love me anymore
Have your learned to live your life without me
Don't you love me anymore
Don't you love me anymore
When you were a dream to me
You turned into a memory
And you became a part of me
That you still remembered me
I thought that it was fantasy
And when I said great ways
To find the end of the rainbow
There were different kinds of goals
Till we turned around
And walked into a fairy tale
Fell into a wishing well
I found you in a fairy tale of time
I believe all of this is destiny
Now I'm where I want to be
There is no other place for me
And when I said great ways to find
The end of the rainbow
There were different kinds of goals
Till we turned around
And walked into a fairy tale
Fell into a wishing well
I found you in a fairy tale
A story that I'll never tell
In the western part of Texas
90 miles from of San Antone
There's a place I go each summer
When I get the urge to roam
I stand out on the highway
If I couldn't catch a ride I'd walk
Let's go to Garner State Park
Come on along to Garner State Park
Where the prettiest girls in Texas
Parade their city slicking clothes
And bought some boots and western wear
We swam all through the day
And that's when it gets dark
Let's go to Garner State Park
We gotta go to Garner State Park
At the dance I met a girl
She was from old Houston town
She was the queen of the park
She was the prettiest girl around
We walked down to the water
Come on and go to Garner State Park
Pretty Cloud to Houston town
San Antone and everywhere around
Next thing I knew it was 4 am
She said my Mother's surely worried
And with the Texas sky above
We couldn't help that we had fallen in love
When you're at Garner State Park
But the summer was soon over
And we had to say goodbye
I said we'll see each other next year
As a tear fell from her eye
When I came I knew no sorrow
Now I'm leaving with a broken heart
From Garner State Park
When you're at Garner State Park
I'll be back again next year
I'll be back again next year
I'll be back again next year
I'll be back again next year
I'll be back again next year
I'll be back again next year
I'll be back again next year
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
From God our heavenly Father
The blessed Angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Savior lay
They found Him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas
All others doth deface
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
But still need help somehow
But my heart still can dream
So here's my life long wish
But for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal the heart
Everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
As children we believed
The grandest sight to see
Wrapped beneath our tree
But Heaven surely knows
That packages and bows
The hurting human soul
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal the heart
Everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
What is this illusion called
The innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief
Can we ever find the truth
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal the heart
Everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal the heart
Everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
This is my only lifelong wish
Woman I hear what you say.
Now and then you've gotta get away.
Never knowing where you're going or what you might do.
Stop my world from falling apart.
Last night I had a dream.
To the arms of another man.
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light from now on
Our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Our troubles will be miles away
Here were are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
With many a winding turn
That leads us to who knows where
Strong enough to carry him
His welfare is my concern
No burden is he to bear
He won't encumber me at all
I'm laden with sadness
That everybody's heart
Isn't filled with gladness
From which there is no return
While we're on our way to there
Doesn't weigh me down at all
He don't love you like I love you
He don't love you like I love you
For the new love that you've found
He uses all the great quotations
Says the things I wish I could say
When the final act is over
And you're left standing all alone
When he takes his bow and makes his exit
I grew up in the void place south of Heaven
Couldn't find the Lord to save my life
How can you expect to find
So I talked to the Man
I said what's the deal now
He was kind and he said
Then I reached into my soul and bought a one way ticket
The only price I paid was some friends who often say
Oh no here he comes and he's got religion
Oh no now you know that's all we'll hear
Ain't it hard to believe that life's sweetest story
Still finds it's way and falls upon deaf ears
Well I have to admit that my conversation
Gets around to the message of my song
Tell me how can we go out and teach all nations
If we haven't heard the lesson here at home
And I guess when your life's been blessed like mine has
You just naturally want to let others know
So my friend if we meet by the gates of Glory
I wanna be the one to say I told you so
Oh no here he comes and he's got religion
Oh no now you know that's all we'll hear
Ain't it hard to believe that life's sweetest story
Still finds it's way and falls upon deaf ears
Oh no here he comes and he's got religion
Oh no now you know that's all we'll hear
Ain't it hard to believe that life's sweetest story
Still finds it's way and falls upon deaf ears
Oh no here he comes and he's got religion
Oh no now you know that's all we'll hear
Ain't it hard to believe that life's sweetest story
You almost have to lose your mind
To find yourself sometimes
You have to close your eyes to see
Just when I thought I'd reached the end
You made it easy to be me
You're the wall I hide behind
You shelter me from time to time
When I feel like giving in
You're the door that I walk through
When I need someone to turn to
You're my best friend
I guess that's how love's supposed to be
When there's no one else around
I fall down to the ground
I feel so tall down on my knees
You're the wall I hide behind
You shelter me from time to time
When I feel like giving in
When I need someone to turn to
You're my best friend
Why should my heart be lonely
When Jesus is my portion
A constant friend is He
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
For His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
Let not your heart be troubled
His tender work I hear
And resting on His goodness
I lose my doubts and fears
But one step I may see
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
For His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
Whenever I am tempted
Whenever clouds arise
When songs give place to sighing
When hope within me dies...
I draw then closer to Him
From care He sets me free
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He cares for me
I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
For His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
His eye is on the sparrow
When ya hold me in your arms so tight
I'll just stay addicted and hope I can endure
All the good love when we're all alone
When I in awesome wonder
The worlds thy hands have made
And I hear the rolling thunder
The universe displayed
When Christ shall come
With shouts of acclamation
What joy shall fill my heart
My God how great thou art
My savior God to thee
My savior God to thee
Why did you make me human
Why did you make me human
I've got the best girl in the world
But make her understand
When I make the tears fall from her eyes
Forgive me for I apologize
Oh and when I make I break her heart
And tear it all apart
Why did you make me human
I've got to work everyday
So little love and so little pay
I know I can't do nobody no wrong
Long enough to sing a song
And people who believe in music
Are the happiest people I've ever seen
So clap your hands and stomp your feet
Lift your voices to the sky
God loves you when you sing
Music is the universal language and love is the key
So take your brother by the hand
And sing along with me
And find out what it really means
And held your loving hands
And thought that fate
Then someone stole my angel
And I lost what I loved most
I may never get to Heaven
But I once came very close
I may never play a golden harp
Or spread some angel wings
Or walk a golden staircase
While the distant chorus sings
But once I held your sweet love
And felt your tender touch
I may never get to Heaven
But I didn't miss it much
I may never get to Heaven
But I didn't miss it much
And if I can't have you
You know I miss you nightly
When you're not at home
To hear your knock on my door
So just come back in a hurry
The truth was all around me
But I closed my eyes and ears
I went looking for the answers somewhere else
Now I've learned to listen
When I used to only hear
And I found the answers inside myself
I can see Heaven's heartbeat
In the stars that shine above
And I can feel the power
With all my imperfections
There's still a place for me
I'm finding how good life can be
A thousand different teachers
Tried to teach me how to sing
But none of them could show me harmony
I feel so much better now
Singing in the key of love
With a different drummer keeping time for me
I can see Heaven's heartbeat
In the stars that shine above
And I can feel the power
With all my imperfections
There's still a place for me
I'm finding how good life can be
In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
As long as I'm with you
By the shifting sea sand
With your hand in my hand
Way up on the mountains
Or way down in the valley
In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
As long as you are there
Even in a far away land
By the shifting sea sand
With your hands in my hand
As long as you are there
Tell me will you be there
It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth goodwill to men
From heavens all gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing
O ye beneath life's crushing load
Whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing
Oh rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing
By prophets seen of old
Shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall own
And the whole world send back the song
The chimes of time ring out the news
Another day is through
Someone slipped and fell
Your courage to renew
Do not be discouraged
For I bring hope to you
What He's done for others
It is no secret what God can do
You'll always feel at home
Wherever you may roam
There is no power can conquer you
While God is on your side
Just take Him at His promise
Don't run away and hide
What He's done for others
It is no secret what God can do
This is a song for those Jesus hearted people
This ones for the way
Them Jesus hearted people treated me
I came across a Norman Rockwell
And the pictures on the page
Brought to mind familiar faces
I think everybody knows the kind I mean
This is a song for those Jesus hearted people
The gentle folks at home
That I'd give the world to see
This ones for the way
Them Jesus hearted people treated me
They are an easy going people
Though they are hard set in their ways
And they do not take the chance
Even though the times are changing
And this a song for those Jesus hearted people
Everybody knows one or two
That I'd give the world to see
This ones for the way
Those Jesus hearted people treated me
How I love those Jesus hearted people
This is a song for those Jesus hearted people
Everybody's known one or two
I'd give the world to see
This ones for the way
Them Jesus hearted people treated me
This is a song for those Jesus hearted people
Everybody's known one or two
I'd give the world to see
This ones for the way
Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Bells on bob tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
O what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
O what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
But misfortune seemed his lot
We got into a drifted bank
And then we got upset
O what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
O what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Let earth receive her King
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and Heaven and nature sing
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
The wonders of his love
The wonders of his love
Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long
Let me walk close to Thee.
Just a closer walk with Thee
Daily walking close to Thee
Time for me will be no more
To Thy kingdom shore.
Just a closer walk with Thee
Daily walking close to Thee
Oh daily walking close to Thee
I once was lost in sin
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul
It bathed my heart in love
And wrote my name above
Just a little talk with Jesus made me whole
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry
He will answer by and by
When you feel a little prayer wheel turning
Then you know a little fire is burning
Have a little talk with Jesus makes it right
I may have doubts and fears
My eyes be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
I go to Him in prayer
And He knows my every care
Just a little talk with Jesus made me right
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry
He will answer by and by
Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning
You will know a little fire is burning
Have a little talk with Jesus makes it right
If again you were just mine
The sun for me would always shine
Though fate had ruled that we must part
You're still the keeper of my heart.
Each night now I'm upon my knee
I pray that you remember me
When we are many miles apart
You'll be the keeper of my heart.
All alone without your love
I ask our keeper up above
To guide your footsteps back to me
Without you life's no good you see.
The treasured memories that burn
I keep and I will always yearn
All the love that once was mine
Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Oh it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I hate to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
But as long as you love me so
Oh it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
How I'll hate to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
But as long as you love me so
Let's all go down to the river
He can raise the dead from the grave
He can make the lame walk
He can make the dumb talk
And open up the eyes of the blind
Let's all go down to the river
Jesus is the man at the river
And He washes people's sins away
He can save your soul
If you give Him control
Be ready for that judgment day
Let's all go down to the river
Let's all go down to the river
Let's all go down to the river
Let's all go down to the river
Where you're going to
Don't waste your time
At things you can't undo
What it puts you through
The things it makes you do
And another dream falls through
What people think of you
What's on their minds
And what it puts you through
The things it makes you do
And another dream falls through
And never let it be said
That you've given into
Oh and what it puts you through
And what it makes you do
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross
Where the dearest and best
For the world of lost sinners was slain
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it someday for a crown
It's shame and reproach gladly bared
Then He'll call me someday to my home far away
Where His glory forever I'll share
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
When my life is almost gone
Hold my hand lest I fall
Lead me on to the light
When my work is all done
By the light thou hast shown
That fair city so bright
Where the lamb is the light
Lead me on to the light
It seems like yesterday
I heard the people say
Son you were born to stray
Someday you'll settle down
I guess there'll come a time
Maybe I'll tow the line
Right now I'm doing fine
Rolling from town to town
I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Guitars and ringing tones
In my blood and in my bones
And I'll call it home
When they put me in my grave
Ain't a worry you need to save
Just hang up my rock and roll shoes
I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
So let that motor run
Headed out towards the sun
I'm in the mood for moving on
But I'll be back someday
I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Let me hide myself in Thee
Let the water and the blood
From Thy wounded side which flowed
Save from wrath and make me pure
Could my tears forever flow
Could my zeal no respite know
These for sin could not atone
Simply to Thy cross I cling
While I draw this fleeting breath
When my eyes shall close in death
When I rise to worlds unknown
And behold Thee on Thy throne
Let me hide myself in Thee
Let me hide myself in Thee
I prayed the time would come
When I'd be someone's
Made me feel brand new
Like the brightest morning sunlight
Brighter than the moon at midnight
If every single star fell from the skies
We're all diamonds in the rough
Till someone cares enough
To take an empty heart
Make the feelings start
You were worth the wait
Like the brightest morning sunlight
Brighter than the moon at midnight
If every single star fell from the skies
Like the brightest morning sunlight
Brighter than the moon at midnight
If every single star fell from the skies
I don't have plans and schemes
And I don't have hopes and dreams
Since I don't have you
I don't have fond desires
And I don't have happy hours
I never will ever again
When you walked out on me
And he's been here since then
I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
I never will ever again
When you walked out on me
And he's been here since then
I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
Calling for you and for me
He's waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me
Oh for the wonderful love He has promised
Promised for you and for me
And though we have sinned
He has mercy and pardon
Pardon for you and for me
I began wanting to be with you
Wanting to be seen with you
But why I just couldn't say
You were my lady and lover
I didn't know what I'd discovered
And still the loving is fun
Just like it was when it all began
We started out simply two young friends
But look what we've become
And still the loving is fun
Count the years we've loved everyone
And since the first time we loved
The midnight sun shined all the ways
When I first held your hand
Our feet was slowly sinking into the sand
That ran between our toes
Of one single place any better than you
And after all these years you're still the one
I want my love to know
And still the loving is fun
Just like it was when it all began
We started out simply two young friends
But look what we've become
And still the loving is fun
Count the years we've loved everyone
And since the first time we loved
Just like it was when it all began
We started out simply two young friends
But look what we've become
I don't remember growing older
Swiftly flow the days
Seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers
Blossoming even as we gaze
Swiftly fly the years
One season following another
Laden with happiness and tears
Now they must learn from one another
They look so natural together
Just like two newlyweds should be
Swiftly flow the days
Seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers
Blossoming even as we gaze
Swiftly fly the years
One season following another
Sweet hour of prayer sweet hour of prayer
That calls me from a world of care
And bids me at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes known
In seasons of distress and grief
My soul has often found relief
By Thy return sweet hour of prayer
Sweet hour of prayer sweet hour of prayer
Thy wings shall my petition bear
To him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless
And since he bids me seek his face
Believe his word and trust his grace
I'll cast on him my every care
I play an old piano from nine till a half past one
I was a little bitty baby when my papa hit the skids
And did the best she could to try to raise me right
The men are gonna love and all the women gonna hate
Reminding them of everything they never gonna be
Maybe the beginning of the World War III
Another something or the other too
The city's decorated up for Christmas
All the stores are open late tonight
People hurry through the frozen streets
Every child has a thousand wishes
Every window has a thousand lights
Every soul has a need for peace
There's a star that still outshines the night
You can find it if you close your eyes
Take a walk through Bethlehem
Come and kneel before the Lamb
Good news for every man
Walk though Bethlehem
Every night another TV special
Merchants counting down the shopping days
Every heart longs for more than tinsel
Something more than just a holiday
Come and celebrate the baby King
You don't have to travel anywhere
Faith and hope and love will bring you there
Let's take a walk through Bethlehem
Come and kneel before the Lamb
Good news for every man
Walk though Bethlehem
Take a walk through Bethlehem
Come and kneel before the Lamb
Good news for every man
Walk though Bethlehem
Take a walk through Bethlehem
Come and kneel before the Lamb
Good news for every man
Walk though Bethlehem
Take a walk through Bethlehem
Come and kneel before the Lamb
Good news for every man
Walk though Bethlehem
Let's take a walk through Bethlehem
Come and kneel before the Lamb
Good news for every man
Give us a forecast snowy white.
Can't you hear the prayers
Somebody said it's four feet deep.
I'm gonna choose to keep
The only Christmas for me.
Like the gift around our tree.
Well I know there's more snow
But a tender Tennessee Christmas
Is the only Christmas for me.
Maybe tinsel town's for me.
Bring home a tan for New Year's Eve.
Still I think I'm gonna keep
The only Christmas for me.
Like the gift around our tree.
It's the only place to be.
But a tender Tennessee Christmas
Is the only Christmas for me.
Well I know there's more snow
But a tender Tennessee Christmas
Is the only Christmas for me.
A tender Tennessee Christmas
The first Noel the angel did say
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Born is the King of Israel.
They looked up and saw a star
And so it continued both day and night.
And by the light of that same star
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Then did they know assuredly
And found the Babe in poverty.
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
For want of clothing they did Him lay
Then let us all with one accord
And with His blood mankind hath bought.
For God hath prepared for us all
They don't give medals to yesterday's heroes
No they don't give medals to yesterday's heroes
I mean to borrow one day from tomorrow
And I'm gonna spend it on sunshine and things that I love
I'm gonna reach out and touch every star above
No they don't give medals to yesterday's heroes
Caught in the heat of passion
Out on the edge of town
I tried to get to heaven on a highway
Hungry for satisfaction
I always get let down
And now I'm standing here alone
With nothing but a heartache.
Throwing rocks at the moon
Back talking to the night
Throwing rocks at the moon
Breaking a hole in the sky
Too many cold embraces
Chilling me to the bone
I held her for awhile before I lost her
Nothing but nameless faces
Out in the combat zone
Where love will last you for a moment
And leave you in the shadows.
Throwing rocks at the moon
Back talking to the night
Throwing rocks at the moon
Breaking a hole in the sky.
Shine the light she loves me
Shine the light she let's me go
Got the stars above me
It's the perfect night for
Throwing rocks at the moon.
Throwing rocks at the moon
Throwing rocks at the moon
Back talking to the night
I'm throwing rocks at the moon
Breaking a hole in the sky.
Throwing rocks at the moon
Throwing rocks at the moon
I'm throwing rocks at the moon
Then you came along and changed my point of view
I can't believe the things I'm looking forward to
Would you believe I'm thinking about a
Two car garage and a two story house
And a couple of kids we can brag about
And your two arms to make me happy living that way
I used to play such a game of hide and seek
I'd go looking for love then hide if it saw me
You could find me with my friends hanging out on the street
Now they're wondering where I could be
Snuggled up on the couch watching TV
Would you believe I'm thinking about a
Two car garage and a two story house
And a couple of kids we can brag about
And your two arms to make me happy living that way
We'll just pack up the kids and go to Yellowstone Park
I want a two car garage and a two story house
And your two arms to make me happy living that way
Where the tree of life in eternal bloom
And they tell me that mine eyes shall behold
In the city that is made of gold.
And they tell me that no tears ever come again
Makes me feel so good
I used to walk along the streets at night
I knew there had to be a better life
Than the one I was watching pass by
Then I found You one winter's night
And it changed my life instantly
You took me into Your tender care
Now I feel like I'm walking on air
I never had so much reason to be proud
I couldn't be any higher than I am
No I never want down from Your love
Makes you feel so good
Now I never have to walk alone
I couldn't recommend a better life
Than Your love now that I've tried
There couldn't be any wonder drug
That could make me as happy as You
I touched the edge of eternity
Since I've given my life up to You
I never had so much reason to be proud
I couldn't be any higher than I am
No I never want down from Your love
Now there's such a beautiful life
Passing in front of my eyes
No more staring the stars at night
Because you are my one star
And ever since I saw your light
I never had so much reason to be proud
I couldn't be any higher than I am
No I never want down from Your love
I never had so much reason to be proud
I couldn't be any higher than I am
No I never want down from Your love
I never had so much reason to be proud
I couldn't be any higher than I am
I been rocked to sleep many a night
Then bob and then Tommy and then Dan.
Around god's golden throne.
But I'll always believe this world
And how they change with the times
Maybe it's me who's gone crazy
When love is so hard to come by
And if love never lasts forever
And they say love is the key
And it's not my way to let them lead me astray
It's only that I want to believe
While in their hands is a dying romance
And if love never lasts forever
And if love never lasts forever
I always heard about the great Atlantic
How it humbles you to stand upon it's shore
So I thought I'd take some time to go and see it
Since I had no ties upon me anymore
But I don't know what I'd wasted my time for
To me it's just a pond that's almost dry
If you want to see an ocean
You should see the tears her leaving made me cry
So I headed west to see that famous canyon
That the Colorado cut so deep and wide
I thought seeing something lower down than I felt
Might cheer me up and ease my troubled mind
But I just got disappointed one more time
It's nothing but a pothole in the yard
If you want to see a canyon
You should see the hole she left here in my heart
So now I stand here staring at the Rockies
I've heard they reach right up to heaven's door
They're like that little hole and that blue puddle
And I see now what I should have seen before
Without her life holds no wonders anymore
It's just a little pile of rocks and dirt
If you want to see a mountain
You ought to try getting over her
Mere words could not explain
You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
Taught me how to live again
Cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me thick and thin
Filled with gratitude and love
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You made me feel brand new
Make me feel brand new
Whenever I was insecure
You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me
With you I'll always have a friend
You're someone who I can depend
To walk a path that never ends
My life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
You for having faith in me
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You made me feel brand new
Make me feel brand new
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You made me feel brand new
Make me feel brand new
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You made me feel brand new
I remember the feeling of wanting to die
When you said goodbye
At first the pain of losing you
Tore my poor heart in two
Now I find my prayers weren't lying
If you think I still love you
Never thought I'd see your heart aching
The same girl I once called mine
There is movement all around
On the waves of the air
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me
We know how to show it
We know how to show it
In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
I got fire in my mind
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me
We know how to show it
We know how to show it
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love and then softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really need to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think
When you know down inside
And it's me you need to show
I really need to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love and then softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really need to learn
When they all should let us be
I couldn't figure why
You couldn't give me what everybody needs
I shouldn't let you kick me when I'm down
I find out everybody knows that
Let me stay around you
One day I'm gonna lift the cover
And look inside your heart
We gotta level before we go
And tear this love apart
There's no fight you can't fight
This battle of love with me
We do nothing but complete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
Oh baby I shake you from now on
I'm gonna break down your defenses
I'm gonna hit you from all sides
Lay your fortress open wide
Nobody stops this body from
I'm gonna be there one day when you fall
I could never let you cast aside
The greatest love of all
There's no fight you can't fight
This battle of love with me
We do nothing but complete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
There's no fight you can't fight
This battle of love with me
We do nothing but complete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be lived with you
There's a way everybody say
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
You don't know what it's like
I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
I live and breathe for you
But what god does it do
You don't know what it's like
You know I love getting up in the morning
When the sun first strikes the trees
All the morning birds that singing above
Still bring back memories
Of a girl who stood beside me
When the rights I did were wrong
But she went back down the river
Just when I thought I could be strong
When I thought I could be strong
She never told me why she left me
But the letter said goodbye
Now my mornings are for wondering
And my nights to reason why
Why a stranger comes to steal the love
Of a girl I had to hold
But she went back down the river
Just when I thought I could be strong
When I thought I could be strong
And now it's all right. It's OK.
And you may look the other way.
We can try to understand
The New York Time's effect on man.
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes.
You know it's all right. It's OK.
I'll live to see another day.
We can try to understand
The New York Time's effect on man.
And now it's all right. It's OK.
And you may look the other way.
We can try to understand
The New York Time's effect on man.
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more
Then my life I can see beyond forever
Loving is such a beautiful thing
Oh you make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away
You and me girl got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night and day
And the tears you had to cry
I can see a new tomorrow
Loving is such a beautiful thing
Made for all to see our precious love
You and me girl got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night and day
And the tears you had to cry
Loving is such a beautiful thing
You make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away
You and me girl got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night and day
And the tears you had to cry
Nobody gets too much love anymore
Here we are in a room full of strangers
Well I'm standing in the dark where your eyes couldn't see me
Well I have to follow you though you did not want me to
Now in my place there are so many others
Well I have to follow you though you did not want me to
I will wait even if it takes forever
I will wait even if it takes a lifetime
Somehow I feel inside you never ever left my side
Make it like it was before
Nobody believes what you say
Oh my love you're so good treating me so cruel
There you go with your fancy lies
And if there's somebody you'll love till you die
Nobody believes what you say
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own.
Gotta do the things I want to do.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
They brought me back to see my way with you.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen.
Never gonna touch your body
Never gonna see you smile
The way that I always do
And when I'm gonna know
That you'll never forget about me
Got a lot of feelings locked inside of me
Wish you understood the pain you caused me
You're the only girl that I ever really wanted
It's killing me because you're not even responding
You've played these games before
Never gonna touch your body
Never gonna see you smile
The way that I always do
And when I'm gonna know
That you'll never forget about me
Baby it's about that time for me to up and leave
I told you before but you wouldn't pay attention to me
If you just would've listened then maybe we could have worked things out
You played these games before
Never gonna touch your body
Never gonna see you smile
The way that I always do
And when I'm gonna know
That you'll never forget about me
Three months have passed and I heard you want me back
I guess I was right when I said that you'd be back
I heard your message on the answer machine last night
Baby give up cause me and you just ain't right
You played those games before
Never gonna touch your body
Never gonna see you smile
The way that I always do
And when I'm gonna know
That you'll never forget about me
Never gonna touch your body
Never gonna see you smile
The way that I always do
And when I'm gonna know
That you'll never forget about me
Never gonna touch your body
Never gonna see you smile
The way that I always do
And when I'm gonna know
That you'll never forget about me
Here's a message to you
It's a call to us all and
The things we must do
Got the cause for our vision
Got the force on our side
When the sky is the limit
When we go for the ride
When we come together
Got to get back on track
It's a call to us all
And there's no turning back
I don't care what you've been doing
I don't care where you belong
From now on we're together
Cause together we're strong
When we come together
Your heart is still so far away
I never felt this way before
And now I'm know that I'm sure
I wanna be right by your side
I wanna be your only one
It doesn't matter where you are
We will never be apart
It doesn't matter where you stay
I will hold you anyway
And every time that you are near
So hear me now don't get me wrong
I do believe that we belong together
I wanna be right by your side
I wanna be your only one
It doesn't matter where you are
We will never be apart
It doesn't matter where you stay
I will hold you anyway
Wish I was holding you now
Doesn't matter we won't be apart
It doesn't matter where you are
We will never be apart
It doesn't matter where you stay
I will hold you anyway
You're the strength that I always need
You're the light in my eyes
You have to promise me that you will stay
I'll be right here and you can count on me
See you can't remember what I can't forget
All the things we had together
When you said we'd be forever
I don't care who's wrong or right
Can we give it one more try
I just need you here tonight
When we touch each other it's pleasure and pain
Tell me what you're missing
Where it all went wrong
Let's go back to where we started
Back to where we started girl
Give me one good reason why we shouldn't try
Don't wanna leave this broken heart
I don't care who's wrong or right
Can we give it one more try
I just need you here tonight
When we touch each other it's pleasure and pain
As if you'd rather be taken the easy way out
When we touch each other it's pleasure and pain
What a night that we both had
All the moments that we shared
I'm about to go erratically crazy
Can't believe that this is real
Can't believe the way I feel
The mood is right by the fireside
Do with me what you did that night
A night without you drives me crazy
Only words cannot express
What it means when I confess
That I'm desperately wanting you so much
I will never make you cry
I am physically addicted to your touch
I'm complete when you're by my side
A night without you drives me crazy
Only words cannot express
What it means when I confess
That I'm desperately wanting you so much
I'd do anything just to have you close to me
It's the way that you do what you do so slowly
Never thought something like this could happen to me
Like you used to do and don't make me wait
A night without you drives me crazy
I'm so tired of playing these games
What you say is never the same
The next day you're gone
You stole my heart with just one kiss
And you're doing me wrong
I gotta stop this now before my heart starts to break
You think what you're telling me is oh so true
But sometimes I still think I'm the man for you
Why are you telling me these words today
We tried to talk last night
But it ended up in a fight
You left me so confused
I thought I was the one for you
But there's something else your going through
So tell me what you wanna do
I gotta stop this now before my heart starts to break
You think what you're telling me is oh so true
But sometimes I still think I'm the man for you
Why are you telling me these words today
I don't know what to say
Should I leave or should I stay
I don't know what to do or why
And every little thing you do
All the girl on the concert scene
Wear their miniskirts and real tight jeans
All the girls who like to scream
Where would I be without all the girls
Everything reminds me of MTV
All the girl on the concert scene
Wear their miniskirts and real tight jeans
All the girls who like to scream
Where would I be without all the girls
Join the party in paradise
Together we'll be all right
Take a trip to a brand new world
Dedicated to all the girls
Join the party in paradise
Together we'll be all right
Take a trip to a brand new world
I swear by the moon and the stars in the skies
And I swear like the shadow that's by your side
I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure I know my part
You'll only cry those happy tears
I'll love you with every beat of my heart and I swear
I'll give you everything I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the walls
And when just the two of us are there
You won't have to ask if I still care
I'll love you with every beat of my heart and I swear
Sometimes you lose sometimes you win
But no matter what you don't give in
And you just get up and try again.
Just put your mind to it
If you wanna come along and join the fun
If you wanna come along then sing this song
And out in the streets
This is a celebration
This is an invitation
Just put our minds to it
If you wanna come along and join the fun
If you wanna come along then sing this song
I know you'll find a better day
If you wanna come along and join the fun
If you wanna come along then sing this song
If you wanna come along and join the fun
If you wanna come along then sing this song
I've been waiting for a lifetime
For someone just like you
Always tried to find a reason
Thought I never would surrender
Till the day you came along
To the words you've never said
And I wonder how we've made it
To find real love instead
A sucker for your loving
A sucker for your kissing
It's like a heatwave in July
Every time we're eye to eye
Rubbing a sucker for your twisting
You take me to the danger zone
But leave me shaking to the bone
Now you really gotta let me know
Now you really gotta let it show
A sucker for your touching
A sucker for your teasing
But I'm not out to sneak a feel
I wanna get to freak for real
Hugging a sucker for your squeezing
I bet you feel it all inside
So let me know I'm qualified
Now you really gotta let me know
Now you really gotta let it show
Now you really gotta let me know
Now you really gotta let it show
Now you really gotta let me know
Every Night before I fall asleep
I say goodnight to the one I'll meet
Knowing one day fate will find you
And lead us home to solitude
I hope it grows wings and lands under your skin.
But soul mates are forever and we're never gonna fall apart.
The Wind blows... The time still grows...
The same casts over me.
Come be my saving grace...
The same casts over me.
They come and go like a
But you know you gotta earn it
If you can conceive it
Then you can achieve it
You really gotta want it
You just gotta have it
You gotta be committed
You gotta live and breathe it
You really gotta mean it
If you wanna reach your dream
You've got things to prove
If you can believe it
Don't let nobody stand in your way
That's when you believe
Before you're gonna hear the crowd cheer
You really gotta want it
You just gotta have it
You gotta be committed
You gotta live and breathe it
You really gotta want it
You just gotta have it
You gotta be committed
You gotta live and breathe it
You really gotta mean it
If you wanna reach your dream
When it comes to giving you my heart
Filled up all the empty parts
When I answer it erases their doubts
And I still feel your touch
When you're in my arms
Baby you're still not close enough
That's how I know it's love
I'm amazed I found someone made just for me
Tell me I would be a fool not to believe
That I've been given a gift in this life
I must have done something right
And I still feel your touch
When you're in my arms
Baby you're still not close enough
That's how I know it's love
Each day I want you more
And I still feel your touch
When you're in my arms
Baby you're still not close enough
That's how I know it's love
And all that I can say is
That I can rock you you girl
That I can rock you baby
With the lights down low
So you think you've got it all together
Before you make a move and get too deep
Don't you know the girl
So look in the other direction
Now that you're right in front of me
There's something that I would
And If you feel the same
I swear that I will be there
That we'll stay the same
Open your eyes and look at me
Tell me that you can't see it too
If you take this ring
I swear that I will love you everyday
That we'll stay the same
We both know this world
But maybe God will let us
If I swear that I will be there everyday
And I swear that I will love you everyday
Ain't it like you to make me smile
When no one else comes around
Ain't it like you to make me smile
Ain't it like you to make me cry
Every mile brings another tear
Ain't it like you to make me cry
How many times have I
For you to say the words
To let me know that you're
How many times have I
For you to say the words
To let me know that you're
Ain't it like you to make me smile
Though I may not tell you enough
When it all gets too much
Ain't it like you to make me
Ain't it like you to make me
Ain't it like you to make me... smile
To love and comfort you
From now until the day I die
I will take you places
That you only think about
When you're asleep at night
Let me take the time to understand
And I will set your spirit free
If you get down on me
It's a game of give and take
So if you get down on me
I'll get down on you tonight
Nighttime turns to day again
And you were on my mind
Winter turns to spring and then
Life has passed you by
Right now we are so young and free
But we're running out of time
So while we got each other here
Let's treat our bodies right
I wanna know exactly what to do
So that you'll never get me off of you mind
Communicate and I'll go undercover
Gonna make you come tonight
If you get down on me
It's a game of give and take
So if you get down on me
I'll get down on you tonight
I'm not the type to change your mind
If you wanna take it slow
No pressure to go all the way
There's other places we can go
Anytime is the right time to reveal it
When two people fall as deep as you and me
I wanna know every inch of your body
So I can set your spirit free
If you get down on me
It's a game of give and take
So if you get down on me
I'll get down on you tonight
To love and comfort you
From now until the day I die
I will take you places
That you only think about
When you're asleep at night
I'll make you realize
The things that you could never see
Let me take the time to understand
And I will set your spirit free
If you get down on me
It's a game of give and take
So if you get down on me
I'll get down on you tonight
If you get down on me
It's a game of give and take
So if you get down on me
Don't let the sun catch you crying
The night's the time for all your tears
Your heart may be broken tonight
But tomorrow in the morning light
Don't let the sun catch you crying
The nighttime shadows disappear
For the morning will bring joy
For every girl and boy
Don't don't don't don't let the sun catch you crying
But stop your crying when the birds sing
Just don't forget that love's just a game
And it can always come again
So don't let the sun catch you crying
Tomorrow in the morning light
Everything gonna be all right
Tomorrow in the morning light
Everything gonna be all right
Tomorrow in the morning light
Everything gonna be all right
You did just the same
We must have thought that we'd be
Searching just to find the love
We both had all along
After all the words were said now
I'm thinking we should just be friends
It seems the circle of love
Brought us back around
We thought we tried our best
By giving up on all the rest
It all just seems so clear
We were just doing what was right
After all those talks together
Thought we gave up on forever
Sometimes the truest lies
Are the ones we tell ourselves
Inside we meant don't go
When your down and troubled
And you need some love and care
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
Even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep your head together baby
And call my name out loud
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Ain't it good to know that
People can be so cold oh yeah
They'll hurt you and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
But don't you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
The way you really feel
You know your eyes reveal
So open up your heart
You know I'm what you really want
When it should be you and I
Then let me be the rain
Then baby look my way
Then I can be your wish
But you know I can tell
Is what I really got to give
But baby you will never know
Until you let me hear
When it should be you and I
Then let me be the rain
Then baby look my way
Then I can be your wish
It's right outside your door
Close enough for you to touch
I'm everything that you've been waiting for
Then let me be the rain
Then baby look my way
Then I can be your wish
Late at night you call on a phone
We talk about the day
When you found out he was cheating
You tell me that it hurts to the bone
To trust someone that way
To find that he was deceiving
And I know I've always just been your friend
Just to promise you this
Endlessly to be true to you
And if you answer my prayer
I cross my heart and I swear
Endlessly to be true to you
And if you'd only see
How beautiful you and I would be
I remember when you fell in love
That it was not with me
I sent a secret prayer up above
And put my heart away
So that you could be free
And I know right now you're broken in two
But did you know my heart's been broken since the day I met you
Just to promise you this
Endlessly to be true to you
And if you answer my prayer
I cross my heart and I swear
Endlessly to be true to you
And in my sweetest dream
You learned to put your faith in me
Sometimes the thing you need
Is the one thing you can't see
If you put your faith in me
How beautiful you and I would be
Just to promise you this
Endlessly to be true to you
And if you answer my prayer
I cross my heart and I swear
Endlessly to be true to you
And if you'd only see
How beautiful you and I would be
1... take your name off the speed dial
3... hit the clubs and get wild wild
4... tell the honeys I'm solo
Breaking hearts across the nation
Process of elimination
Need some time just for me
And that girl that lives next door
I don't care what you say
Your love is not the be
I don't believe you when you say you're sorry
Baby I can't believe what I saw
I went out to the store just to kill the time away
There you were on the lips of another body
I never felt the rain so hard upon me
I never knew the pain could hurt so deeply
I can't believe I never realized it till that day the strangest thing is growing deep inside me
The sight of you getting it on so sweetly
But I won't do what I used to do
Get it through my head we're through
You should have told that you cheated behind my back
You should have thought before you making your move so fast
Can't believe that you cheated with your best friend
You should have told me but you chose not to let me in
Girl there's nothing I'd rather do
Then be breaking this bed with you
Get you all soaking wet
Better know what now comes next
Ooh I'm never going to stop the game we play
You should know that I'm a player
But it's real the way I feel you
Lay right here in this bed of roses
Scream that word to get me stronger
I can't hold this any longer
Finally I think I've found ya
Girl I feel we're like a game
Cause nothing ever feels the same
When I'm spending my nights in bed with someone new
I never really had a clue
The way you're playing me baby makes me crazy
Ooh I'm never going to stop the game we play
You should know that I'm a player
But it's real the way I feel you
Lay right here in this bed of roses
Scream that word to get me stronger
I can't hold this any longer
Finally I think I've found ya
You should know that I'm a player
But it's real the way I feel you
Lay right here in this bed of roses
Scream that word to get me stronger
I can't hold this any longer
Finally I think I've found ya
I wanna be with you tonight
So frustrated in my position
That's the only way for you to feel me
I will do anything to find my lady
I wanna be with you tonight
There's a part of my life that I'm missing
I wanna kiss and touch and hug my baby
I wanna be with you forever
I wanna be with you tonight
I wanna hold your body baby
I'll never give up I'll win this fight
Show me the way I'll get there baby
I'll never give up I'll win this fight
Show me the way I'll get there baby
Bad girl you make me cry
Bad girl you teach me how to lie
That girl's on an ego trip
She gave everyone her lips
I thought I had another nightmare
My ex girl ya she makes me scared
Anymore I don't want it
Anytime I can't forget it
I called your home you picked up the phone
And I could hear that you're not alone
Bad girl do me a favor get out of my face I can't breathe
Mess around with my mind
Sorry baby girl but you're cheap to me
My situation that's your ignorance
Could not believe my eyes I saw you dance
With what's his name I can't remember
I saw him last December
A little part of me is dead now
But I will be all right anyhow
I'm sure I'm not gonna
Touch you ask your mama
She tells me that bad girls around only brings me drama
After all that we've been
You're a you're a bad bad girl
Don't wanna hear a story
Don't come and tell me sorry
You could have been there for me
Staring in the flame of a candle light
Wanna warn them what's to follow
How many mistakes till y'all gonna see
You know damn well they wanna burn you
And you know damn well you won't survive
Come on and end all your fighting
She looks around and wonders why there's so much hate
And she fears of what's to follow
You know damn well they wanna burn you
And you know damn well you won't survive
Come on and end all you're fighting
Everybody get up and shout it out
Friday night about ten o'clock
In the back seat getting hot
Couldn't wait to get you in bed
Pulled it out and you went ahead
I said stop wait what is that
Steaming up in my Cadillac
Couldn't see and I couldn't breathe
You're about to kill it lady
Girl you know that I'm the only one that gives a damn
Grow up start to use your brain or find another man
I'm getting deep and I'm getting close
To finding out what you love the most
But I don't know why they're telling you
Sunday night I'll be over you
Before we lose everything we got
Lot of things you can stimulate
But you're about to kill it lady
Girl you know that I'm the only one that gives a damn
Grow up start to use your brain or find another man

You know things about me I've let nobody see
If I have to I'll wait patiently
And I know that I've made oh so many mistakes
But forgive me please let us be
I will swear to you girl
Here in front of the world
Remember when you promised me
You would always be there when I needed you
You know things about me I've let nobody see
If I have to I'll wait patiently
And I know that I've made oh so many mistakes
But forgive me please let us be
I will swear to you girl
Here in front of the world
And I know that I've made oh so many mistakes
But forgive me please let us be
I will swear to you girl

I wonder if our story ends
How am I supposed to live my life all by myself
I'll give you strength
Give you everything I've got
Just to spend one night with you
If we'll be ever be together
One day you can love somebody
Then winter turns to spring
And you don't know them at all
I don't know where you're gonna be
All I know is you're gone
I'll give everything I have to be with you
I know what you're gonna say
Girl you're gonna tell me that you told me so
Now that you're right in front of me
There's something that I would
And If you feel the same
I swear that I will be there
That we'll stay the same
Open your eyes and look at me
Tell me that you can't see it too
If you take this ring
I swear that I will love you everyday
That we'll stay the same
We both know this world
But maybe God will let us
If I swear that I will be there everyday
And I swear that I will love you everyday
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength
Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
I'll be there to protect you
With an unselfish love I respect you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength
If you should ever find someone new
I know he'd better be good to you
You gave me everything that a girl could want
A hero sandwich and a glass of wine
You better keep away from other girls
Keep away from other girls
You told me everything that I loved to hear
Mixed my dreams with instant cheer
You better keep away from other girls
Keep away from other girls
A hundred times or more
When you were close to me in that corner booth
You held me closer than a clinging vine
You better keep away from other girls
Keep away from other girls
You better keep away from other girls
Keep away from other girls
You better keep away from other girls
Keep away from other girls
Without a groom there can't be a bride
Without a groom there can't be a bride
Send back the presents
There's no use pretending
Just to save my pride
It's so very impossible to have a wedding
Without a groom there can't be a bride
So there go the flowers
There's nothing that anyone can say or do
Although it's only a week or so before the wedding
You're in love with somebody new
And the plans that we made are all through
And to go on would be a mistake
Even though my heart is breaking
Send back the presents
No matter how much it hurts me deep inside
It's so very impossible to have a wedding
Without a groom there can't be a bride
Without a groom there can't be a bride
As much as I love you
As much as I need you
Like a fool I let you down
Like a fool I let you down
I hold you closely you push me away
I want forever you just want today
Give me your fingers wash out your mouth
Bite off my tongue on this bloody couch
But I don't blame you
On your good good night
I hear the tick of a bomb
All your hair in a fuse
You ask me for a light
To blow away these blues
But I don't blame you
On your good good night
I hold you closely you push me away
I want forever you just want today
Give me your fingers wash out your mouth
Bite off my tongue on this bloody couch
But I don't blame you
Are you the tornado in my sails
Are you Jesus without the nails
Are you the bury met without the rails
Are you Paris without snails
But you're all I've got
When you lick my candy girl
When you lick my candy
Are you Disneyland without whales
Are you a farmer without bales
Are you the red lion without ales
Are you the lakes without the dales
But you're all I've got
When lick my candy girl
When you lick my candy
Are you Ra without Dion
Are you the words in the sky without neon
Are you indigenous or did you disappear
Are you the lime in my bottleneck of beer
My rusty nails stuck to you like glue
Got a little red horn hidden underneath this cape
I'll go to Kuwait if I wanna get wanna get crude
I wanna be famous just so I can get sued
Guess who's my girlfriend
Wanna know who my boyfriend is
It's a man in a shuttle with a tube
Can't even catch a tune with a hook
I've been to Hong Kong
In a little wood plane
When I took it further
I'll go to Kuwait if I wanna get wanna get crude
I wanna get famous just so I can get sued
Jesus is my girlfriend
Jesus is my girlfriend
Jesus is my girlfriend
Jesus is my girlfriend
I didn't want to wake you up
I didn't want to wake you up
You hadn't moved an inch
I wish that I could wake you up
I wish that I could wake you up
The next week I kicked you in the head
I wish that I could wake you up
Three days later you're underground
I wish that I could wake you up
Three years later you're underground
I wish that I could wake you up
You came into my head
I couldn't wake you up
I want to wake you up
I wish that I could wake you up
I wish that I could wake you up
I wish that I could wake you up
Take me in your arms again
Tie me to the house again
Love me till love dies
Love me till love dies
Blame me for everything
Not just for the bad times
Whispering sweet nothings in your ear
Just like a dead bird sings
Look into my face again
Between us there's a mile
I can see a hole in the sky
As wide as your smile
It's not that you've gone away
It's that I've never met you
But I wish that you'd come back to me
Just like the night turns blue
Just like the night turns blue
Take me in your arms again
Not just the bad times
Whispering sweet nothings in my ear
Just like a dead bird sings
You asked me not to speak
Then kissed me on the cheek
You said that I was wrong
You said that I was weak
I tried to think awhile
You said I was too long
And when I tried to smile
You sung this pretty song
It'll blow your mind back to how it was
I felt what once was through your frozen clothes
My arm around you won't stop you shake
In the Wintertime when the leaves are gone
I look at you and wonder what's wrong
You took me to your rented motor car
And filmed me on the bonnet
You got me to hitch my knees up
And pulled my legs apart
And pulled my sleeves around my heart
Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous
I know you'll get me through
You said my clothes were sexy
You tore away my shirt
You rubbed an ice cube on my chest
Snapped me till it hurt
Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous
I know you'll get me through
You said I wasn't cheap
You paid me twenty pounds
You promised to put me in a magazine
On every table in every lounge
Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous
I know you'll get me through
Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous
Know you'll get me through
Know you'll get me through
Know you'll get me through
Know you'll get me through
Know you'll get me through
Know you'll get me through
Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous
I know you'll get me through
It's time to come down from your spire
I've covered the church in fish wire
If we hear a trip in the aisle
Turn on the lights with a big smile
There's no beautiful child
It's tealeaves with the roof tiles
Tealeaves with the roof tiles
We go on home with the radio on
Tune into paradise on the long wave
For a millionth time a born again song
What is this beautiful thing we've found
And bought a little patch of ground
And I put a shop on top
And bought myself some stock
Oh I'm so happy I could scream
In my little store on the green
Where everything is fine
Where everything is fine
I found some corrugated steel
And banged it to the window with my heel
And now nobody's going to get in
After half past ten in the evening
Oh I'm so happy I could scream
In my 8th little store on the green
Oh you ugly beautiful thing
You ugly beautiful thing I'm in between your head and your sting
Ugly beautiful thing I'm between your head and your sting
Whirling out your wings one by one till you sing like king king bing
Ugly beautiful thing how I sing with your plastic wing on the tips of my broken wing.
Oh I'm so shy when you ride up so high and I cry because I can see the possibility that you might one day die.
Ugly beautiful thing I'm between your head and your sting whirling out your wings one by one
Until you sing like a king bing.
Ugly beautiful thing. ugly beautiful thing.
Hey that's why. you know I know.
You ugly beautiful thing. you ugly beautiful thing. you ugly beautiful thing.
You ugly beautiful thing. you ugly beautiful thing. you ugly beautiful thing.
Fucking stop it dead now.
Wig wig wig wig wig wig whack.
I'm too handsome to be homeless
Then we set them alight
I'm too handsome to be homeless
But we won't make you come
Corkscrew your fingers
Look out of the window
Way down on the ground
But here we at the airport
Like ladybirds in July
I wish that you were here
If I had a cellular phone
I'd drown it in my beer
Locked inside your pretty head
But I was so different then
And you were roughly the same
Love was in your pretty head
Baby bird... don't you cry
Don't you fly away from me
With golden leaves for you and me
You can lie here on my soft red chest
Baby baby bird... I'm so lonely
And the sky is so cold and unstable
Baby bird... don't you cry
Don't you fly away from me
Baby baby bird... let me be
The cage around your Christmas tree
Baby bird... set me free
He had a bad old man who beat him
Took a hammer to his knees just to please him
He's an open mouth in a beehive
He's gonna smile and be happy
Make everyone know that he's happy
Put his smiling face on a billboard
With his swollen lips around his early teens
In his dress he can't believe it's in his genes
But on his blue days he wouldn't touch his greens
He's gonna make you smile and be happy
Make everyone know that he's happy
Put his smiling face on the TV
He drowned his stepson in the duckpond
He put razor blades in the ice cream
He's got a young man who feeds him
Whispers sweet nothings just to please him
He makes him cool for the TV
Makes half the man he is a celebrity
With his swollen lips around his early teens
In his dress he can't believe it's in his genes
He drowned his stepson in the duckpond
He put razor blades in the ice cream
Made nobody famous on the big screen
Put the whole wide world on remote control
He put a five times rapist on his TV show
On every single channel in every single home
You can even hear his voice on the telephone
A little bomb with feelings
I'm built like a house
A little house that's peeling
As it peels away then you'll see
I burn like a tree at the end of the garden.
We've put up a swing for the children.
There's no feeling there's no feeling at all.
With the world on TV she's given up believing
Put the car in reverse
Without you this house is a hearse without wheels
You can't work out which cringing
Which cringing feels worse
When I touch you like this
On the place that it hurts
Give me all that you have
If you don't I will steal it
All the things that you've lost
Now I'm falling apart every minute of every hour
But you're here to put me back together again
When I don't know where you are
Your trail feels so warm
But I'm covered with frost
When I left in the morning
I can make you feel good
You can make me feel bad
I'll never get you back
So you'll never be sad
Give me all that you have
If you don't I will find it
All the things that you've lost
Now you're falling apart
Every moment of every day
You're not here to put me
Give me all that you have
If you don't I will steal it
All the things that you've lost
Now you're falling apart every moment of every day
And the rain comes down
And makes a fool out of us
And murder the raindrops
Oh but we don't hear it coming
We don't hear it coming
And I won't say goodbye
Because I was never here
And I won't say hello
Because it wouldn't be true
And if I told you that the sky was green today
And you can't say goodbye
Because I am always here
And you can't say you love me
Because it wouldn't be true
And the rain comes down
And makes a fool out of us
And murder the raindrops
Oh but we don't hear it coming
We don't hear it coming
But the cats and the birds do
It was the night before
When I knocked on your door
Had the buttons of your dress in my eye
3 o'clock in the morning
When my mind is dawning
I remember what I've done and I cry
You make me feel like a man
Who can't see that his time has come
I'm the first man on the sun
Stuck a fork in my leg
Trying to remember your name
Hid my trousers as they slowly bled
Caught my brain in my zip
Let my intelligence slip
As I failed to get you into my bed
Can't make you feel like a woman
Who can see that her time has come
I'm the first man on the sun
It was the night before
When I knocked at your door
Put your fingers to my head and went bang
Put her hands down my trousers
And pulled out my tongue
She was lucky to get life
You make me feel like a man
Who can't see that his time has come
I'm a ghost coming through your wall
You will always be mine
You will always love me
You will always be mine
You will never be free
Little birds between my ears
Drop it through my empty eyes
Please come back again
You will always be here
I will always love you
You will never be free
You will always be young
As the sun warms me up
You will always be mine
You will always love me
You will always be mine
You will never be free
You will always be mine
You will always love me
You will always be mine
That I'd be born with
For you to scratch me
Like all the records that your needle has worn
Got his face kicked in
That I'd be born with
For you to scratch me
Like all the records that your needle has worn
I will never go blind
I got this cable satellite nibbling my eyes
But I can't switch off my mind
That I've misunderstood
That I'd be born with
For you to scratch me
And all the girls are good
There are bad men in the dead trees
And a girl in the wood
All the little children when you catch him
Drop a going back to the womb pill
And cover up the hole
And when the sun comes up and I can't get a tan
Oh yeah I'm happy now
And when the sun comes up and I can't get a tan
Oh yeah I'm happy now
Take out the big shovel
And wade it through the earth
This man's so old with evil
He should have been put down at birth
But the people can't decide
Whether to laugh or cry
This man deserves to die
And when the sun comes up and I can't get a tan
Oh yeah I'm happy now
And when the sun comes up and I can't get a tan
Oh yeah I'm happy now
Then all girls are good
There's bad language in the trees
Something dirty in the wood
All the little children when you catch him
Drop a going back to the womb pill
And cover up the hole
And when the sun comes up and I can't get a tan
Oh yeah I'm happy now
And when the sun comes up and I can't get a tan
Found you on the roadside
Little cuts and bruises underneath your chin
You begged them to bury you before your life sets in
She sees me in the garden
Pulling petals off the flowers
She closes all the windows
Shuts down on the bed and shivers
Take her back in time to the place before it happened
Take me back in time to the place where it happened
With a handful of rusty nails
And then he pushed you into a ditch
With the slugs and the snails
I'm so angry she's not angry
Every second of every hour
She shuts the door and slides the latch in
Tries to wash him off in the shower
Take her back in time to the place before it happened
He lay there for three days
Your heart held in his knuckles
He tried to pull out your hair
Rip the scalp with his buckle
You're like no girl I know
I would have stabbed him
I would have stabbed him
There's a house in your head
They shine through your eyes
Through your mouth on your tongue
There's a house in my head
It's not funny anymore
Place our heads side to side
Knock a hole through the wall
Push your tongue through my ears
Leave me there inside the house
Then you scream through the keyhole
It's not funny anymore
It's not funny anymore
There's a car on the road
And it drives like a dream
See your lies in my eyes
Tear the brakes from the floor
Drop your toes on the gas
I'll stand here like a wall
There's something going on.
There's something going on.
There's something going on.
There's something going on.
But I can't fight it.
But I can't fight it.
There's something going on.
There's something going on.
There's something going on.
There's something going on.
Like the clouds in the sky
Wanna get the spiders off my hips
When you don't get kissed
You wanna get it up but
And mothers got your fists
Crossing off the kids on the Xmas list
Wanna have all that they never had
Wanna have all that they never had
Girl's got your bottle
With a bag for a crown
But you wonder what for
Wanna have all that they never had
Wanna have all that they never had
Wanna have all that they never had
Wanna have all that they never had
Get away from all of it across the sea
Don't let your brain tease
Just let the suncream
When you're home late
And no one comes down
Your life was her life
Don't let her out of your sight.
Your tattooed fingers
Can't touch her any more
Don't let her out of your sight
Your life was her life
And let her out of your sight
And no one comes around
There's bug in the jam jar
They forgot to put in holes
Their legs are broken
With their wings sprinkled on the floor
It wasn't me it was my friends
It wasn't me it was my friends
There's bugs in the room
And they're listening
I can't see the fire in their tails
The fireflies are hiding
You got music in the palm of your hands
And there's money for the drugs and the band
You got pretty little kids you can bruise
But you can't get the talent off your shoes
You got eyes in the back of my head
You got eyes in the back of my head
You got eyes in the back of my head
You got eyes in the back of my head
He's got a tiny little radio mind
And a pale green face at the stop sign
He's a dream for the misunderstood
You got eyes in the back of my head
You got eyes in the back of my head
You got eyes in the back of my head
You got eyes in the back of my head
You got eyes in the back of my head
You got eyes in the back of my head
You got eyes in the back of my head
You got eyes in the back of my head
They got eyes in the back of your head
It's like a blind man sleeping in your bed
You pay him absolutely nothing for relief
You got eyes in the back of my head
You got eyes in the back of my head
You got eyes in the back of my head
Cross the numbers off your list
We got love on our fingers
And hate on our knuckles
We just can't get it off
We just can't get it off
We might as well give it up
Throw our hands in the air
And wave them in the air
Like you just don't care
We got an apple in our forehead
We just can't shake it off
We just can't shake it off
I just can't get enough
Your heart is like a swarm of bees
A little breeze that makes a sound
You want to climb down
Got stung on my little tease
It's the little things that make the big disease
So I'll sleep on the couch
If you turn out the light
I just love the way you are
But that was last night
We'll buy you new skin
We'll buy you clothes
We'll out new fists in
You'll always be this pretty thing
Take a look at the sky
Take a look at the ground
You'll hear the sound
Take a look at the ground
The way your feet don't move
Spinning like car wheels
Take a look at your eyes
Like the holes in the ground
Till you hear the sound
Somewhere you shouldn't be
Before your ears got wings
Things you never want to hear
So high the air stings
You can touch the sky
The Apple went bad and lost its smile
It was heaven for a while
You get it all at any price
God I'm so glad you named it twice
It's the Christmas God of New York
It's the Christmas God of New York
There's Christmas light around the spire
My little bulldog's all on fire
Wish I could walk across the sea
When the world goes quiet
But the silence gets too loud
I've had these these things
That I could never give up
Because they were in my blood
To that little kid I was
It's a beautiful radiation
The world's bleeding on my TV screen
I don't need to leave my armchair
Slip it over like an electric blindfold
Now I see sunshine and a swimming pool
I don't care if it's empty
Drive drive through it
Dive dive in it... it's shallow
Suck suck it... and swallow
I hit my head on the floor
Split my skull like a hammer
I don't care that I feel bad
There's nothing hidden in the meaning
It's all in the smile
Drive drive through it
Dive dive in it... it's shallow
Suck suck it... and swallow
Blow holes through it
Hide hide in it... it's hollow
When you go away I'll try to find someone else
And if you came back you'd hold my heart like a giant
We couldn't bare it again
We'll treat you so much better this time
When love fails and I'm broken like a snail in my shell
You hold me in your hand
Like a tiny grain of sand
We couldn't bare it again
We'll treat you so much better this time
When you come back you'll try to find what we had
And if you stay here you'll hold my hand like Jesus
We couldn't bare it again
We'll treat you so much better this time
When I come in and I'm tired
And I've forgotten myself
It's like I'm still wired
And I put up walls a little each day
When everyday I'm losing sense
And I'm losing my taste
Then you change all that
You take the knives out of my back
And peel away my old skin
When I come in from a long day
And the world won't stop
And it won't stop spinning
Try to find something
Then you change all that
You take the knives out of my back
Peel away my old skin
Then you change all that
When it gets dark at four
And feels like I've been dragged through a graveyard
And I'm stuck here in this tiny box
With the lid nailed on
When everyday disappears
But they all feel long
Then you change all that
You take the knives out of my back
Peel away my old skin
Then you change all that
Swimming round my blood
My little love ... my love
All the little things ... I love
My little love ... my love
All the little things ... I love
My little love ... my love
All the little things ... I love
My little love ... my love
All the little things ... I love
My little love ... my love
All the little things ... I love
My little love ... my love
What a wonderful morning
What a wonderful feeling
Go on for ever and ever
What a wonderful morning
What a wonderful feeling
What a wonderful morning
What a wonderful feeling
Though my eyesight's going
And my heart is slowing
Now my bones are showing
It's still a wonderful morning
Though her skin is looser
And the world's abused her
She's the happy ever after
On this wonderful morning
What a wonderful feeling
On this wonderful morning
What a wonderful morning
Looking up at the ceiling
Goes on for ever and ever
Looking for some soft soap
To take away my brain
To make us feel like hippies
Lying here complaining
Can't get off my butt
But there's nothing we can do
With Jesus on their side
You're the only thing I know
You're the place I want to be
Lock me up inside your soul
And throw away the key
You're my air on the moon
I'm the lighter you're the spoon
If I ever let you go ... it'll be too soon
Swallowing all the things
Up there on the screen
I'd like to pull my eyes out
We can't get up and riot
Think I'll lie back down and read the bible
With Jesus on their arms
You're the only thing I know
You're the place I want to be
Lock me up inside your soul
And throw away the key
You're my air on the moon
I'm the lighter you're the spoon
When the diamonds in your smile fall out
When the laughter in this house runs away
And the men come to take away the TV
And you find yourself changing the locks
And the light in my face
Like the gun in your hand
When the sticks and stones start to hurt
And we're talking just to dig up dirt
With our minds running out in the street
When we're stuck here to the house like concrete
And the light on my face
And the knife in your hand
In the morning when the world's up
And I can't breathe for the people
My heart stops and my head hurts
And I can't see my way
I take pills but they don't help
They just kill time till home time
Half alive nine to five
Till I come home to you
That something ... that someone ... to sing about
That somewhere ... that someplace ... to smile about
In the evening with the world gone
And there's no one around
A chair swings in the back yard
And I can't hear sound
Yeah we do drink and it does help
It just kills time till work time
Half awake half past eight
That something ... that one thing ... to sing about
You make me feel ... better than Jesus
You make me feel ... better than drugs
You make me feel ... better than anything
You make me feel ... better than love
You'd made it all right
You make me feel ... better than god
You make me feel ... better than everything
You make me feel ... feel feel feel feel
Me and you we got superpower
Like electric chairs in the shower
You make me feel ... better than anyone
You make me feel ... better than love
You make me feel ... better than Jesus
You make me feel ... feel feel feel feel feel
You make me feel ... better than drink
You make me feel ... better than anything
You make me feel ... feel feel feel feel
When you're kicked around and knocked down
And you've got nothing left to give
At the failed suicide club
When you're put down like a little kid
And you've got nowhere to live
At the failed suicide club
At the failed suicide club
Step twelve... at the club
At the failed suicide club
Sometimes it gotta stop
I'm cold when you're cold
I'm warm when you're warm
But baby you could try
There's just time to stop love
But baby you could try
Love's so sweet it suffocates us
Like a sickly kindly gag
And we're floating down the sewer pipe
Like kittens in a bag
And the mirror screams to both of us
That we are not alone
Then the metaphors explode
And suddenly we're home
But baby you could try
But baby you could try
You can love me if you want to
But it's best if you don't
But it's best if you don't
But it's best if you don't
But it's best if we don't
But that's just what you like in a man
But it's best if you don't
But it's best if you don't
I should be locked up for who I am
I've got straight white teeth and a tan
But that's just what you like in a man
But it's best if you don't
It would kill me if you left me
But I don't think you will
But that's just what you like in a man
I've got straight white teeth and a tan
But that's just what you like in a man
Sometimes my heart stops
And I can't see you through the teardrops
You hold me like a sister holds a brother
Just a little sad that we feel that way
Somewhere under your skin
Someplace no one can break in
Somewhere I just can't get to
Something that is just for you
Felt like we hung out all day in a noose
Waiting for some dream to cut us loose
Somewhere under your skin
Someplace no one can break in
Somewhere I just can't get to
Something that is just for you
Somewhere dark inside my heart
Someplace no one put a light
Somewhere you could start a fire
Saw a man in a bar with his hair like a lady
He had holes in his hands and a cross for a spine
I can't remember where I was last night
Think I was hanging naked off a church spire
Felt like I was Jesus on fire
Cuffed to the bumper of a big truck
Drank kerosene slammers through my eyeballs
Drove myself home in a stolen car
Turn a bird upside down and it lies in your fingers like a dead man
When you throw it in the air it's resurrected from your hand
I can't remember where I was last night
Think I was getting on a night bus
I'm getting married in the big bad morning
But it feels like I'm giving birth
I feel so happy I could scream
Saw a man in the street lying on the floor beaten up
He had a fish finger sandwich and a yellow m coffee cup
I bent down drunk and tried to pick him up
But when I turned around I could see... it was Jesus...
I can't remember where I was last night
Think I was hanging on a church spire
Felt like I was Jesus on fire
Cuffed to the bumper of a big truck
I begged my dad to take me to a strip bar
Drank kerosene slammers through my eyeballs
Drove myself home in a stolen car
I can't remember where I was last night
Think I was getting on a night bus
I'm getting married in the big bad morning
But it feels like I'm giving birth
I feel so happy I could scream
It's not so difficult and it's not easy
I really don't know what to say
We've been over this a thousand times or more
You don't know who I am
Though I've been living here for years
Lying next to you crying like a baby
Don't you remember the first time when you asked me to come over
I'm sure that in the cold light there was nothing that wasn't true
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
We can't believe this is it
This should be happening to somebody else
Now we're locked here in the car not speaking
I know that in the morning everything I say will be a terrible waste
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
If nothing changes then I sure will
Fill me up till I spill
I'm up to here on sugar pills
I'm not sick and I'm not ill
They hide their ghosts inside my head
I just want something to change
It wasn't me who made the error
You can't see them it's like they're dead
They hide their ghosts inside my head
They took my safety and my free will
You can't see them it's like they're dead
They hide their ghosts inside my head
He's got love on his fist and
You download his list
He won't show you his face because
He's lost out in space
Yes he's serious this time
I would kill for you my friend
I would die for you again
He's not committing a crime
Yes he's serious this time
I would kill for you my friend
I would die for you again
Breaks into your house
Gets in through your mouse
Like he was never there
It decorates my cell and I never wanna be free
It puts food on the table for a family I can't afford
The kids that we once were when we were free
All I know is all you know and all you know is all I know
For all you know it's all I know for all I know it's all you know
There's nothing left between us
And nothing in between
Come back come back come back come back
My little heart is not alone
Under a card you made your home
Now all I hear is your pretty voice silent on the telephone
There's nothing in my brain
There's nothing in your heart
There's nothing left to stop us
Nothing left to start
Come back come back come back come back
Decided not to fall apart to wait another year
But there's nothing left between us
And nothing in between
There's nothing left between us
There's nothing left between
There's nothing left between us
And nothing in between
There's nothing left between us
There's nothing left between us
There's nothing left between us
There's nothing left between
There's nothing left between us
And nothing in between
All I know is all you know and all you know is all I know
For all you know it's all I know for all I know it's all you know
With nothing left between us
There's nothing in between us
And nothing in between
With nothing left between us
And nothing in between
There's nothing left between us
And nothing in between
Have you ever seen the golden mile
Have you ever driven someone wild
Have you ever wanted to kill a screaming child
Have you ever taken the mean out of meanwhile
And a plane's flying by
Smoking around the loops of your nickname
I used to call you CFC
It used to rhyme with happy
I've got no one to blame
And I'm going out to change the world
But it's so easy for me to say
When I sit on my butt all day
So angry and clenching my fist
Crossing the word selfish off my list
Have you ever sat down
His way for a good cause to France
There's a car on the road and it drives like a dream
See your lights in my eyes as my tears stream
I'll stand here like a wall that you made from sugar glass
Take a look at the sky
Take a look at the ground
You'll hear the sound
Take a look at the ground
The way your feet don't move
Spinning like car wheels
Take a look at your eyes
Like the holes in the ground
Till you hear the sound
Somewhere you shouldn't be
Before your ears got wings
Things you never want to hear
So high the air stings
You can touch the sky
Everybody groove to the music
We've been waiting so long
Just can't hold it back no more
It's time for me to let it go
If you really wanna see what we can do for you
I get ruthless when I get wet keep the party packed in my corner
Tough like granite to keep the crowd hype get up on this just to get right
If you really wanna see what we can do for you
We've been waiting so long just can't hold it back no more
Time for me to let it go
Everybody groove to the music
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
I'd walk halfway around the world
For just one kiss from you
Far beyond the call of love
As long as your love's there to lead me
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Is all I'm ever gonna need
I used to think that dreams were just
For sentimental fools
And I'd never find someone
Who'd give their love so true
But I knew the very minute
Couldn't live my life without you in it
And now I want the whole wide world to know
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Is all I'm ever gonna need
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Is all I'm ever gonna need
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Is all I'm ever gonna need
You're the one for me
You're the one I need
And move it all around
And move it all around
But tell me if you feel it too
My heart is crying out for you
I feel in heaven when I look in your eyes
And I want it right now
And move it all around
And move it all around
And move it all around
And move it all around
Ooh baby you're so fine
I'm gonna make you mine
Your lips they taste so sweet
You're the one for me
You're the one I need
Come on girl and get down
And move it all around
Here it is if you wanna get with this
I feel in heaven when I look in your eyes
And I want it right now
And move it all around
And move it all around
And move it all around
And move it all around
Ooh baby you're so fine
I'm gonna make you mine
Your lips they taste so sweet
You're the one for me
You're the one I need
I feel in heaven when I look in your eyes
You drive me crazy cause
And I want it right now
You're the one for me
You're the one I need
And move it all around
And move it all around
And move it all around
And move it all around
And move it all around
From the first day that I saw your smiling face
You felt that you'd never love again
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
And I know you're afraid
To let your feelings show
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Even in my heart I see
Deep within my soul I feel
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
I live my life the way
Everything I do is for you
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
Let's stop this tonight
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
So incredible in my eyes
Whenever you're around
My whole world's upside down
But I try to get closer
And you always push me away
You tell me it's much too soon
But I just can't help it
I always gotta make a play
Go right into overdrive
Always gotta lose control
That you think we should wait
And I can't hold on anymore
So please don't hesitate
I gotta do what I gotta do baby
That you think we should wait
And I can't hold on anymore
So please don't hesitate
This is for the lovers
Strictly for the lovers
You got someone you wanna get close to
Then get close to this
Just to be close to ya
Like a flower to a tree
That's how close I want to be
Like the stars to the night
And daytime is to light
The only thing that I see
Just to be close to you
So lonely is the night
Without you to hold me tight
My life would mean nothing
Without the joy you bring
Just to be close to you
I'm gonna give you all my love
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you
Give you everything you need
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you
Give you all you want
Just to be close to you
I don't want to be alone
Just wanna be close to you
I don't want to be alone girl
Just to be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
It's crazy but it's true
I'd like to know your policy
I'd like to know what's in your mind
I know now what I feel
Until you face the truth
When the light is fading
You know what I wanna do
It's crazy but it's true
Wish you'd come and set me free
All the things I've left behind
I'm looking for a sign
Until you face the truth
When the light is fading
You know what I wanna do
It's crazy but it's true
It's crazy but it's true
It's crazy but it's true
It's crazy but it's true
I don't know where to start
Comes straight from the heart
I never meant to hurt you
Of what I put you through
Girl I'd do anything for one more chance
I see your face and I wonder
When you close your eyes
Do you think about me
Now that I've realized
You're all that I see
You and I shared it all together
Each other was all we'd ever need
I thought that you would stay
But I took for granted
The love you gave to me
Baby I need you back with me
I see your face and I wonder
When you close your eyes
Do you think about me
Now that I've realized
You're all that I see
I don't know what to do
Please say it's just a matter of time
Until I feel your touch
Until you let me come back to you
Every day and night and day
And it feels so right
I never meant to hurt you
But now those days are over
And now I'm counting the minutes
I'm counting the days
Until you let me come back
Until you let me start
To get back into your heart
I want you back again
I see your face and I wonder
When you close your eyes
Do you think about me
Now that I've realized
You're all that I see
You're all that I need
That every time I close my eyes
Things just ain't the same
I know you still care
So tell me what to do
To get things back again
The way they used to be
If your words had meaning
If you really cared about me
Tell me why can't I find love in your heart
Or come as a friend to me
Tell me why would you turn away from my love
Tell me what to do to make things right
Tell me what to do to make things right
Tell me what to do to make things right
If your words have reasons
Then they won't turn away from me
Trying hard to hide all truth that you might say
If you listen to me girl
If you know how I'm feeling inside
Tell me what to do to make things right
Tell me what to do to make things right
Tell me what to do to make things right
All I'm asking for is a chance
With me is where you should be
And if by chance we should find
That it can be for you and I
Tell me what to do to make things right
Tell me what to do to make things right
Tell me what to do to make things right
Give anything for your love
Tell me how can I make you mine
Girl you should know how I feel by now
There are so many ways to love
So just open your heart
All I'm asking for is a chance
And if by chance that we should find
That it can be for you and I
Tell me what to do to make things right
Tell me what to do to make things right
Tell me what to do to make things right
Baby won't you tell me what to do to make things right
Baby won't you tell me what to do to make things right
But all I wanna know is where the party at
But all I wanna know is where the party at
But all I wanna know is where the party at
Come and dance with me
Don't you hear the music
Don't you feel the groove
I wanna dance with you
But all I wanna know is where the party at
Throw your hands up in the air
I like the way you swing it
Girl you gotta work that body
To have a night like this
You really blow my mind
Can't believe it's true
I've been waiting all night long
To get a girl like you
So everybody enjoy yourself with me
Give a call or beep her
It's time to get it on
You want more than what you came here for
Across the dance floor
I wish for that sweet little kiss
Don't be no Cinderella
I like the way you swing
So enjoy yourself with me
When you try your best
Cause good times will come again
And you've had as much
And when it seems as though
Nobody understands young man
Oh don't you let your head hang down
Just stick to your plan
That's what you gotta do
That's what you gotta do
Everything will be fine
It's gonna be all right
Don't put yourself down
If you just can't find
When you give your heart
But you don't get much
Your time is gonna come
The whole world's a school
Young woman understand
That's what you gotta do
That's what you gotta do
That's what you gotta do
And when it seems as though
Nobody understands young man
Oh don't let your head hang down
You've got to roll with it

You've got to roll with it
You've got to roll with it
Everybody roll with it
You've got to roll with it
You've got to roll with it
Everybody roll with it
Ain't nobody else but you
Ain't nobody else but you
Ain't nobody else but you
Nobody else can do it
There is nobody who can make me lie
Nobody else can do it
Give me one more chance to make it right
The time has come for us to reunite
There's no one like you
Who can make it right
Nobody else can do it
When you're not close to my body
You're a bittersweet delight
Come and help me through the night
Ain't nobody else can make me cry
Ain't nobody else can make me lie
Give me one more chance to make it right
The time has come for us to reunite
I never wanna be without you
I never wanna be without you
We had a simple argument
But not enough to keep out
If I can't be with you
And no other girl will do
I never wanna be without you
I never wanna be without you
I can't seem to figure out
Just what went wrong with us
You must have thought I was selfish
But everything I did I did it for us
If I can't be with you
And no other girl will do
I never wanna be without you
I never wanna be without you
If I can't be with you
And no other girl will do
If I can't be with you
And no other girl will do
I can't eat or even sleep
My life won't be complete
Unless you stay my girl
I never wanna be without you
I never wanna be without you
I never wanna be without you
I never wanna be without you
Come on girl let me break it down
Let me walk you home from school
I've got something that's on my mind
And I don't know just what to do
See girl I've been watching you
And I think I'm a little sprung
Can't seem to get my mind off you
Keep thinking about you
I think that you're the one
There's so much I wanna say
Girl I've got this love for you
You can have it your way everyday
I will treat you right
Girl I promise to you that I won't make you cry
And tell me you're feeling the way that I do
I'll give you my heart
Let's put them together
See what we can start
I'll give you my heart
Let's put them together
See what we can start
All those people they talk about
It's only a puppy love
They say our feelings cannot be real
But we know the deal yeah
I just don't know what to do
And I know it's not wrong
Because I wanna be everything that you need
There's so much I wanna say
Girl I've got this love for you
You can have it your way everyday
I will treat you right
Girl I promise to you that I won't make you cry
And tell me you're feeling the way that I do
I'm gonna walk you home from school
And when you need a kiss or two
Girl if you say yes to me
I promise that I will not
I'll be right by your side
Girl my love for you I cannot hide
I'll give you my heart
Let's put them together
See what we can start
I'll give you my heart
Let's put them together
See what we can start
I'll give you my heart
Let's put them together
See what we can start
I'll give you my heart
Let's put them together
See what we can start
Girl I wanna be everything that you need
And it's like that and that's the way it is
My heart's on the line
Just don't say goodbye
I'll give you my heart
Let's put them together
See what we can start
I'll give you my heart
Let's put them together
See what we can start
I'll give you my heart
Let's put them together
See what we can start
I'll give you my heart
Let's put them together
See what we can start
Something about the way you moved
The way your body swayed
As I watched you from behind
That got me so excited
Baby let me be the one to hold you
To give you the things I know you need
You know that we could wait another life time
And we can never find a love just like this
You can get all inside me
And I can get all inside you too
Let's take this chance to get to know each other better
Baby we will discover that we can be more than lovers
I'll give you what you need
Just come to me and get it
Baby you won't regret it
I wanna feel your body next to mine
And before this night is over
You will know what it means
To make love until you scream
You can get all inside me
And I can get all inside you too
Find just what what we've been looking for
Hold me and don't you let go
You can get all inside me
And I can get all inside you too
Everybody groove to the music
We've been waiting so long
Just can't hold it back no more
It's time for me to let it go
If you really wanna see what we can do for you
I get ruthless when I get wet keep the party packed in my corner
Tough like granite to keep the crowd hype get up on this just to get right
If you really wanna see what we can do for you
We've been waiting so long just can't hold it back no more
Time for me to let it go
Everybody groove to the music
Even in my heart I see
Deep within my soul I feel
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
I live my life the way
Everything I do is for you
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
Let's stop this tonight
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me
I don't care who you are
As long as you love me
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
When you look into my eyes
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
You'd better rock your body now
Now throw your hands up in the air
You'd better rock your body now
I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
I don't care if he buys you nice things
I'd make it so we'd never be apart
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Praying for the day that you'll be mine
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
I don't want you to cry no more inside
Could never add up to all the love I have inside
And I will give it to you
My love is all that I have to give
All that I have is for you
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
But my love is all I have to give
I wish I could give the world to you
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
I'd walk halfway around the world
For just one kiss from you
Far beyond the call of love
As long as your love's there to lead me
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Is all I'm ever gonna need
I used to think that dreams were just
For sentimental fools
And I'd never find someone
Who'd give their love so true
But I knew the very minute
Couldn't live my life without you in it
And now I want the whole wide world to know
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Is all I'm ever gonna need
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Is all I'm ever gonna need
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Is all I'm ever gonna need
I could tell when I stepped in the room
And I saw you standing there
And about by the way that you moved
I couldn't help the way I stared
There were some mysterious force
Leading me here to you
So I stood there watching
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
And I was lost inside you world with you
Now it feels like it could be romance
As we dance across the floor
Every move that your body makes
Only makes me want you more
And it seems like time's moving fast
As we keep on dancing
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
And I was lost inside you world with you
And just imagine this alone
Let the music put you in a zone
Why do you do the dance you do
Hey Mr. DJ play that song for me
Hey Mr. DJ play that song for me
From the first day that I saw your smiling face
You felt that you'd never love again
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
And I know you're afraid
To let your feelings show
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Things just ain't the same
I know you still care
So tell me what to do
To get things back again
The way they used to be
If your words had meaning
If you really cared about me
Tell me why can't I find love in your heart
Or come as a friend to me
Tell me why would you turn away from my love
Tell me what to do to make things right
Tell me what to do to make things right
Tell me what to do to make things right
If your words have reasons
Then they won't turn away from me
Trying hard to hide all truth that you might say
If you listen to me girl
If you know how I'm feeling inside
Tell me what to do to make things right
Tell me what to do to make things right
Tell me what to do to make things right
All I'm asking for is a chance
With me is where you should be
And if by chance we should find
That it can be for you and I
Tell me what to do to make things right
Tell me what to do to make things right
Tell me what to do to make things right
Give anything for your love
Tell me how can I make you mine
Girl you should know how I feel by now
There are so many ways to love
So just open your heart
All I'm asking for is a chance
And if by chance that we should find
That it can be for you and I
Tell me what to do to make things right
Tell me what to do to make things right
Tell me what to do to make things right
Baby won't you tell me what to do to make things right
Baby won't you tell me what to do to make things right
You're the one for me
You're the one I need
And move it all around
And move it all around
But tell me if you feel it too
My heart is crying out for you
I feel in heaven when I look in your eyes
And I want it right now
And move it all around
And move it all around
And move it all around
And move it all around
Ooh baby you're so fine
I'm gonna make you mine
Your lips they taste so sweet
You're the one for me
You're the one I need
Come on girl and get down
And move it all around
Here it is if you wanna get with this
I feel in heaven when I look in your eyes
And I want it right now
And move it all around
And move it all around
And move it all around
And move it all around
Ooh baby you're so fine
I'm gonna make you mine
Your lips they taste so sweet
You're the one for me
You're the one I need
I feel in heaven when I look in your eyes
You drive me crazy cause
And I want it right now
You're the one for me
You're the one I need
And move it all around
And move it all around
And move it all around
And move it all around
And move it all around
The candle plays the hour glass days go
And all I do is think of you
And wonder where you are at night
I remember everything
I pushed you out of my mind
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Set adrift on memory bliss
Destiny in everything
Reality has replaced you with
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life
I bet you say that I don't care
I bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are
Baby will you be there
Baby will you be there when I open my eyes
After all the time I spent wishing
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Set adrift on memory bliss
Sadness that overwhelmed me
My mind fights carelessly imagine
I guess that's just the way it goes
So now I must place you with all the things
That I could never have
Set adrift on memory bliss
I know this love is true
If you want to be a good girl
If you want it to be wild
And if you wanna get it done

You'd better rock your body now
Now throw your hands up in the air
You'd better rock your body now
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me
I don't care who you are
As long as you love me
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
When you look into my eyes
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
I don't care if he buys you nice things
I'd make it so we'd never be apart
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Praying for the day that you'll be mine
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
I don't want you to cry no more inside
Could never add up to all the love I have inside
And I will give it to you
My love is all that I have to give
All that I have is for you
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
But my love is all I have to give
I wish I could give the world to you
Somebody told me that you're not my kind
You keep on doing all the things I like
You got me hypnotized
But that's the way I like it
It's a price I got to pay
For all the things you do
Gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
That's the way I like it
Oh mystery lady you've got something I like
Tell me you're here to stay
You're dangerous so baby
Will you come out to play
Cause that's the way I like it
Gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
That's the way I like it
Gotta listen to the groove
And you gotta listen well
That's the way that I like it
That is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it
That is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it
That is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it
That's the way I like it
Once we were dreamers
Just dreamers we were
Now I see you're just somebody
Who wastes all my time
Your ten thousand promises
Your ten thousand promises
Once I could handle the truth
When the truth was you and I
But time after time all the promises
Turned out to be all lies
Now I see I'm just somebody
Who wasted my time and money
Your ten thousand promises
Your ten thousand promises
You say I'll take you back
But I closed the door
Ten thousand promises yeah
Ten thousand promises you gave to me
Your ten thousand promises
Your ten thousand promises
If I could right the wrongs that made you cry
With A Love so strong
And I can't take the day without you by my side
Girl If I could change
If I could change your mind
Maybe you could help me wipe these tears from my eyes
The sun from shining down on me
And If you take away the loving arms that surround me
Then I might break down and cry just like a child
Girl I can't belong and I won't be free
I hope you understand
That there's a broken heart that lies within your hands
Baby you can help me stop these tears from my cries
The sun from shining down on me
And If you take away the loving arms that surround me
Then I might break down and cry just like a child
With her spirit running free
Think of what our love could be
If our hearts could set us free
The sun from shining down on me
And If you take away the loving arms that surround me
I could tell when I stepped in the room
And I saw you standing there
And about by the way that you moved
I couldn't help the way I stared
There were some mysterious force
Leading me here to you
So I stood there watching
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
And I was lost inside you world with you
Now it feels like it could be romance
As we dance across the floor
Every move that your body makes
Only makes me want you more
And it seems like time's moving fast
As we keep on dancing
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
And I was lost inside you world with you
And just imagine this alone
Let the music put you in a zone
Why do you do the dance you do
Hey Mr. DJ play that song for me
Hey Mr. DJ play that song for me
The candle plays the hour glass days go
And all I do is think of you
And wonder where you are at night
I remember everything
I pushed you out of my mind
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Set adrift on memory bliss
Destiny in everything
Reality has replaced you with
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life
I bet you say that I don't care
I bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are
Baby will you be there
Baby will you be there when I open my eyes
After all the time I spent wishing
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Set adrift on memory bliss
Sadness that overwhelmed me
My mind fights carelessly imagine
I guess that's just the way it goes
So now I must place you with all the things
That I could never have
Set adrift on memory bliss
I know this love is true
There are people who say what you wanna hear
Even on a rainy day they'll tell you the sky is clear
When you really really love someone am I right
When I say that you want them near
And if you care you even tell them things
The simple lies that she said
I will never leave you
All the love I thought she had
But can you blame me no
Cause that's what she said
She told me we'd see forever
That's what she said she said yeah
Who say what they really mean
She said she'd always be there
She said she'd always care
But just when you think that you can trust that someone you love
Tell me why do I know that stars can fall from above
Those simple lies that she said
I will never leave you
All the love I thought she had
But can you blame me no
Cause that's what she said
She told me we'd see forever
That's what she said she said
But you're not hurting yourself
You're only hurting me
Why would you say things that you really didn't mean
Oh how can I make you see just what you did to me
Ooh you said how much you really care
Just when I thought I was in love
Girl how could you care
If I were you I could not lie even once to the face of the one
Those simple lies she said
I will never leave you
All the love I thought she had.
But can you blame me no
Cause that's what she said
She told me we're see forever
She told me we'd be together.

That you'll come back home and don't take too long
You know I'd go out of my mind if you ever left my heart behind
So I'm begging you please bring your sweet love back to me
I can't go on in this world alone
I'm a star with no light a day with no night
Late at night I reach to hold you tight
You give to me so tenderly
We used to feel that time would stand still
And when I see you baby it will
You know your man needs you so
I can't go on in this world alone
I'm a star with no light a day with no night
I can't go on in this world alone
I'm a star with no light a day with no night
You know I'll go crazy without you
I can't go on in this world alone
I'm a star with no light a day with no night
Oh baby I'm missing you
We used to love so strong
Tell me where did we go wrong
Oh baby I'm missing you
They say I'll learn to forget
But It sure ain't happen yet
Been checking up the places where we used to go
And looking for your face inside the crowd
I've been talking to the people that we used to know
But nobody wants to say where you hang out
And when I call your phone
And you don't return my calls
This breaking of my heart
Oh baby I'm missing you
We used to love so strong
Tell me where did we go wrong
Oh baby I'm missing you
They say I'll learn to forget
But It sure ain't happen yet
I still have your pictures hung around my room
They're the only thing that's left of you and me
And make it just the way It used to be
Can never go on without you
Girl I don't wanna think about it
I can't sleep at night
No this can't be right
Oh baby I'm missing you
We used to love so strong
Tell me where did we go wrong
Oh baby I'm missing you
They say I'll learn to forget
But It sure ain't happen yet
I know there's a chance for you and I
And I believe there's no way our love could die
Oh baby I'm missing you
We used to love so strong
Tell me where did we go wrong
Oh baby I'm missing you
They say I'll learn to forget
There is something special
About this time of year
The Christmas feeling's everywhere
I just got home to join you
But now I'm back to share my love
Filled with love to last throughout the year
A sleigh ride in the park
The smell of chestnuts in the air
And Christmas lights they gleam across the sky
All of our time spent in flashes of light
And that makes you larger than life
And that makes you larger than life
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
That I want it that way
I never wanna hear you say
Yes I know it's too late
But I want it that way
I never wanna hear you say
Now I can see that we've fallen apart
No matter the distance I want you to know
That deep down inside of me
Don't wanna hear you say
I never wanna hear you say
I never wanna hear you say
I never wanna hear you say
Show me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Your every wish will be done
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
Your every wish will be done
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
You are missing in my heart
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Kinda get me go crazy
I can't control it anymore
I've never felt like this before
My hungry heart must be fed
Baby it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Now I know why I was born
You feel my feelings one by one
Baby it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Kinda get me go crazy
Kinda get me go crazy
All that I ever wanted
All that I ever wanted
You say that's it only you
Open up your heart to me
But I still need you in my life this time...
And I need you tonight
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
I really need you tonight
And I know in time that you will understand
Then what we have is so right this time...
And I need you tonight
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
All those endless times we tried to make it last forever more
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
I know deep within my heart
Don't... don't want you back
You hit me faster than a shark attack
And you were more than just a pretty face
But I should have known that I would be
Another victim of your sexuality
But now we're done and over with
Don't... don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
You know you gotta go
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
I never thought that I would lose my mind
That I could control this
Never thought that I'd be left behind
Girl if only I knew what I've done
To show how much I care
Don't wanna lose you now
Don't wanna lose you now
I've got this feeling you're not gonna stay
It's burning within me
Whatever reason to leave that I've had
My place was always beside you
And I wish that I didn't need you so bad
Your face just won't go away
Don't wanna lose you now
Don't wanna lose you now
I never thought that I would lose my mind
That I could control this
Never thought that I'd be left behind
That I was stronger than you
Don't want to lose to loneliness
Girl I know we can win
Don't wanna lose you now
Don't wanna lose you now
I guess you were lost when I met you
Still there were tears in your eyes
So out of trust and I knew
No more them mysteries and lies
The helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night
Who will make all your sorrows undone
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
And make sure that you'll be alright
And I want to take you from darkness to light
A helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night
Who will make all your sorrows undone
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
And make sure that you'll be alright
You need me like I need you
I can show you what true love means
Where you can run to make it alright
Who will make all your sorrows undone
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
Where you can run to make it alright
Where you can run to make it alright
And make sure that you'll be alright
It's not that I can't live without you
It's just that I don't even want to try
Every night I dream about you
Ever since the day we said goodbye
If I wasn't such a fool
Right now I'd be holding you
To find a way back to your heart
And find a way back to your heart
I don't know how it got so crazy
But I'll do anything to set things right
Baby you're the best thing in my life
Let me prove my love is real
And make you feel the way I feel
I promise I would give the world
If only you would tell me girl
To find a way back to your heart
And find a way back to your heart
To find a way back to your heart
And find a way back to your heart
And find a way back to your heart
To find a way back to your heart
From now until the end of time
This heart of mine belongs to you
To find a way back to your heart
Here we are in the arms of one another
And we still go on searching for each other
Knowing that hate is wrong and love is right
When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight
It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes
Let it be if we're nothing more than dreamers
Who believe that we see no wall between us
When all I could find
When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight
It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes
I loved you from a distant star
I couldn't reach that far
I can't believe how close that we are
When I look into your Spanish eyes
And the world is so beautiful tonight
It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
When we turn out the lights
The two of us alone together
But girl you know that I would never
No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close
And when I wake up to
The touch of your head on my shoulder
Girl you know I'll always treasure
Every kiss and everyday I love you girl in
No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close
No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close
It takes a lot to know what is love
A lot of prayers to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
When I was young just how to grow
Everything that I should know
Just how to walk without your hands
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I've had many years of grace
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I wanna thank you for what you've done
In hopes I can give back to you
And be the perfect son
When I was young just how to grow
Everything that I should know
Just how to walk without your hands
You showed me how to love
You showed me how to care
And you showed me that you would
I wanna thank you for that time
And I'm proud to say you're mine
When I was young just how to grow
Everything that I should know
Just how to walk without your hands
Cause mom you always were... the perfect fan
If I'm still your man.
Girl... I've got forever inside
I'll be there for you.
I'll give you my heart
I'll... be there for you
Girl... I've got forever inside
I'll be there for you
No matter what happens
You can count on my love...
I'll... be there for you
Girl... I've got forever inside
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll... be there for you
When I first met you my life turned a page
Chapter one was how true love was made
You taught me with your kiss
Things about romance I'd missed
You knew everything from A to Z
What pleases you and what pleases me
Girl when you touch me
And I wanna read every word
So I know everything about you
Girl I just can't get enough of your love
I know you wrote the book on love
You're like a fire that burns in my soul
Like a volcano I'm ready to blow
And I wanna read every word
So I know everything about you
Girl I just can't get enough of your love
I know you wrote the book on love
I hear what your heart is saying to me
I see the picture so clearly
You wrote the book on love
Girl I just can't get enough of you
Oh you wrote the book
And I wanna read every word
And I wanna read every word
So I know everything about you
Girl I just can't get enough of your love
I know you wrote the book on love
You wrote the book on love
Be that certain someone
You wish for every night
You wouldn't say what you said
We'd be together instead
Of you breaking my heart
Over things that aren't true
If you knew what I knew
Are filled with disillusion and fears I have inside
Like a lost soul... I feel like I'm all alone
If only I could feel your pain within your heart of stone...
Be that certain someone
You wouldn't say what you said
We'd be together instead
Of you breaking my heart
Over things that aren't true
If you knew what I knew
Then you wouldn't have to go away
If you knew what I knew
Then you would be here... to stay
You wouldn't say what you said
We'd be together instead
Of you breaking my heart
Over things that aren't true
You would never have said what you said
You would never have said what you said
If you knew what I knew my baby
You would never have said what you said
If you knew what I knew my baby
You would never have said what you said
If you knew what I knew my baby
You would never have said what you said
And it's only been one day
And hold you in my arms
The nights are much too long
Girl my heart stays with you
I wanna rush over to you
My heart stays with you
I won't break your heart
I know you feel me baby
No matter what you do I think of you
Girl my heart stays with you
I wanna rush over to you
But I've got a job to do
To feel your sweet face
No one can take your place
I'm rushing over to you
Wherever I go whatever I do
Wherever I go whatever I do
Wherever I go whatever I do
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
But I called my girl up and said
Just wanna tell you don't worry
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
Just because I made that call and lied
Just wanna tell you don't worry
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
Just wanna tell you don't worry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
If every minute it makes me weaker
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
If every second it makes me weaker
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

But to show you the shape of my heart
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Now let me show you the shape of
Let's talk about one baby
You gotta hear me out
Do you really wanna be the last to know
He's the essence of your life
But he'll eat you up from inside slow
And then he doesn't wanna know
And then he doesn't wanna know
There's nothing that he's worthy of
Get another Boyfriend
Let's talk about what he's done
To become your number one
Just go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up
There's nothing that he's worthy of
Get another Boyfriend
That he's just a player in love
This must come to an end
Get another boyfriend
There's nothing that he's worthy of
Get another Boyfriend
There's nothing that he's worthy of
Get another Boyfriend

Always starts the same way
It seems like everyone we know
From the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
As a lover and a friend
When you think I'm not aware
You're searching for clues
Of just how deep my feelings are
All I know is what I feel
When I look into your eyes
From the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
As a lover and a friend
With everything that I am
Oh there are no guarantees
Oh And what I'm trying to say to you
From the bottom of my heart

From the bottom of my heart
As a lover and a friend

You're everything I am
You see me sitting here
There's been to many things
Together we have seen
It's not that hard if we start to believe
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life
This world is not at ease
We seem to hide the truth
Thinking there's only so much we can really do
It's up to you and me
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life
When there's so many things we can do
To help this troubled world start a new
The answer to our life
Tell me the way we fall out of line
The answer to our life
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
We've been through days of thunder
Some people said we don't belong
They try to pull us under
But here we stand together and were millions strong
And this one goes out to
So this one goes out to you
We're standing strong
And this one goes out to you
We've been inside the circus
We took the pleasure with the pain
I guess there's something about us
So this one goes out to you
We're standing strong
And this one goes out to you
Now we're minutes away
Time for the show to begin
You make us feel like we've just begun
And this one goes out to you
So this one goes out to you
We're standing strong
And this one goes out to you
So this one goes out to you
We're standing strong
I can see that you've been crying
You can't hide it with a lie
That what you have is wrong
I heard him promise you forever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lines
I won't say the words then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
I will love you more than that
And I will love you more than that
I won't say the words then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
I don't wonder why we haven't tried
It's not too late to change your mind
I will love you more than that
I won't say the words then take them back
I won't say the words then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
I won't say the words then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Just what the past has brought me
To the man I wanna be
And I know that we have had some times
That we can't forget the struggle
Change can be so good
So let's not forget why it's understood that
And what we've been through
Time is what it is come what may
I remember when mom used to say
That things are getting better
And you'll soon be on your way
Way back when nothing else mattered
Change can be so good
And what we've been through
Time is what it is come what may
And we'll always stay together
And through it all you know
And what we've been through
Time is what it is come what may
And what we've been through
Time is what it is come what may
Time goes on and on everyday
I was looking for something
On a crime scene where you're in too deep
I found a note with his number
That you ain't true to me
You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see
Things will never be the same again with you
And now I know what it's coming to
Let me tell you it's not for me
I don't wanna be part of your screenplay
Just give me the story
And I'm tired of your games of Hide and Seek
I'm getting the feeling that it's time for me to leave
You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see
Things will never be the same again with you
And now I know what it's coming to
Let me tell you it's not for me
Let me hear you say No no
Well let me tell you it's not for me
Things will never be the same again with you
And now I know what it's coming to
The way you make me feel inside
Something about you makes me feel
Say these three words I wanna hear from you
Take your hand and walk with you
Say these three words that promise to
Give you everything you need and someday
Start a family with you
Take your hand and walk with you
Give you everything you need and someday
Start a family with you
This is no ordinary love
And I can never have enough
Of all the things you've given to me
For giving me the strength to love her
More and more each day
I promise her as long as I hear those three words
Take your hand and walk with you
Say these three words that promise to
Give you everything you need and someday
Start a family with you
Take your hand and walk with you
Give you everything you need and someday
Start a family with you
I stand beside you in everything you do
Take your hand and walk with you
Say these three words that promise to
Give you everything you need and someday
Start a family with you
Take your hand and walk with you
Give you everything you need and someday
Start a family with you
It's gonna be all right
Even the lovers makes a mistake sometimes
Fall out and lose his mind
And I'm sorry for the things I did
For your teardrops over words I said
From the bottom of my heart
Without you I would fall apart
But I love you and I always will
So I wonder if you want me still
From the bottom of my heart
Without you I would fall apart
I'd do anything to make it up to you
And open your heart once again
From the bottom of my heart
Without you I would fall apart
From the bottom of my heart
Without you I would fall apart
The best of friends like sister and brother
We understood we'd never be alone
Now I want you so much
The night is long and I need your touch
Don't know what to say
Never meant to feel this way
Don't wanna be alone tonight
I hear your voice and I start to tremble
Brings back the child that I resemble
I cannot pretend that we can still be friends
Don't wanna be alone tonight
And it has to be tonight
I don't wanna live this life
I don't wanna say goodbye
If you love won't nothing
The rest of our lives
You don't run with the crowd
You don't play after dark
Got your own kind of style
Baby that's why you captured my heart
I know sometimes you feel
Like you don't fit in
And this world doesn't know
A rose that can grow anywhere
And there's no one I know that can compare
What makes you different makes you beautiful
What's there inside you
In your eyes I see all the love I'll ever need
What makes you different makes you beautiful to me
You got something so real
You touched me so deep
You won me with all that you do
And I wanna take this chance to say to you
What makes you different makes you beautiful
What's there inside you
In your eyes I see all the love I'll ever need
What makes you different
Makes you beautiful...
You don't know how you touched my life
Oh in so many ways I just can't describe
You taught me what love is supposed to be
It's all the little things that make you beautiful to me
What makes you different makes you beautiful
What's there inside you
In your eyes I see all the love I'll ever need
What makes you different makes you beautiful to me
Everything in you is beautiful
Love you give shines right to me
Everything in you is beautiful
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
That I want it that way
I never wanna hear you say
Yes I know it's too late
But I want it that way
I never wanna hear you say
Now I can see that we've fallen apart
No matter the distance I want you to know
That deep down inside of me
Don't wanna hear you say
I never wanna hear you say
I never wanna hear you say
I never wanna hear you say
You'd better rock your body now
Now throw your hands up in the air
You'd better rock your body now
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me
I don't care who you are
As long as you love me
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
When you look into my eyes
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Your every wish will be done
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
Your every wish will be done
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
You are missing in my heart
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Even in my heart I see
Deep within my soul I feel
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
I live my life the way
Everything I do is for you
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
Let's stop this tonight
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
I don't care if he buys you nice things
I'd make it so we'd never be apart
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Praying for the day that you'll be mine
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
I don't want you to cry no more inside
Could never add up to all the love I have inside
And I will give it to you
My love is all that I have to give
All that I have is for you
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
But my love is all I have to give
I wish I could give the world to you
All of our time spent in flashes of light
And that makes you larger than life
And that makes you larger than life
From the first day that I saw your smiling face
You felt that you'd never love again
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
And I know you're afraid
To let your feelings show
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
But I called my girl up and said
Just wanna tell you don't worry
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
Just because I made that call and lied
Just wanna tell you don't worry
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
Just wanna tell you don't worry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
If every minute it makes me weaker
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
If every second it makes me weaker
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Now let me show you the shape of
I guess you were lost when I met you
Still there were tears in your eyes
So out of trust and I knew
No more them mysteries and lies
The helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night
Who will make all your sorrows undone
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
And make sure that you'll be alright
And I want to take you from darkness to light
A helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night
Who will make all your sorrows undone
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
And make sure that you'll be alright
You need me like I need you
I can show you what true love means
Where you can run to make it alright
Who will make all your sorrows undone
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
Where you can run to make it alright
Where you can run to make it alright
And make sure that you'll be alright
I can see that you've been crying
You can't hide it with a lie
That what you have is wrong
I heard him promise you forever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lines
I won't say the words then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
I will love you more than that
And I will love you more than that
I won't say the words then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
I don't wonder why we haven't tried
It's not too late to change your mind
I will love you more than that
I won't say the words then take them back
I won't say the words then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
I won't say the words then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Don't pretend you're sorry
You know you got the power
To make me weak inside
I can't imagine life without your love
And even forever don't seem like long enough
And my heart beats again
You keep me drowning in your love
I'm swept away by love
You keep me drowning in your love
Of floating freely in your arms
I don't need another lifeline
I can't imagine life without your love
And even forever don't seem like long enough
And my heart beats again
You keep me drowning in your love
I'm swept away by love
You keep me drowning in your love
Go on and pull me under
You know I can't resist
And my heart beats again
You keep me drowning in your love
I'm swept away by love
You keep me drowning in your love
You keep me drowning in your love
Keep me drowning in your love
And my heart beats again
You keep me drowning in your love
I'm swept away by love
Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
I've tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
You still wonder if we made a big mistake
I've tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
I don't mean to drag it on
But I can't seem to let you go
I don't wanna make you face this world alone
I've tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
Looking at your picture from when we first met
You gave me a smile that I could never forget
And nothing I could do
Could protect me from you that night
I just want you to know
Some days I make it through
And then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe
That there's a day you'll come back to me
I would do it all again
Just want you to know
And deep inside I wish it's me instead
My dreams are empty from the day
The day you slipped away
And then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe
That there's a day you'll come back to me
I would do it all again
I just want you to know
That I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through
And then there's nights that never end
That there's a day you'll come back to me
Everybody knows that I was such a fool to ever let go of you
Yeah I know I said we'd be better off alone
It was time that we moved on
Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you
Begging for a second chance
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you
I know you're in there and you can make me wait
But I'm not gonna wait
Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and now I'm crawling back to you
Begging for a second chance
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you
If you could see these tears I'm crying
Touch these hands that can't stop shaking
Hear my heart that's barely beating
You will see a different man
Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
Begging for a second chance
My pride spilled on the floor
Now I'm crawling back to you
The sun is over the city but it's an orange day
There is reason for looking up but I'm feeling down
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world no matter how you roll it
Hey hey hey sweet baby
Sent a message to a GI in the desert
Said thank you man for bringing another dawn
Back here it's her and me and we're having our first baby
He's out there taking them on
It's a weird world and I know you know it
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world no matter how you roll it
Hey hey hey sweet baby
I'm closing my eyes but I'm starting to see
The only thing he does is just keep me away from you
But don't let them take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile
Hey hey hey sweet baby
There's a way just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey sweet baby
There's a way for you to decide it
Are you still the same
And when I'm looking back
How we were young and stupid
No matter how I fight it
Just can't let you go
I still care about you
Like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you
That I keep coming back
And I'm stuck in a moment
How we were young and stupid
I've tried to fight it
That I still need you
I still care about you
Like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you
I wish I could find you
Just like you found me
Julie was a long way from home
She could make alone look pretty
Her attitude made her part of the landscape
Riding her bike through Alphabet City
She likes to party in the backseat
Under the bridge on the Brooklyn side
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow
Taking bets that the sun won't rise
She can lick her lips and smile
And make you wanna believe
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
Julie liked to shoplift in stores
Ride alongside the rich and famous
And make love on the floor till the camera made us
And no woman in the world ever made me feel like my heart's on fire
When she left I cried
And I was wrapped around her finger
And I began to believe
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
Tell me what you want from me
I've got everything you need
It's getting hard for me to breathe
Let me be your guarantee
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl
I made a promise to myself last night
I'm gonna keep it if it's wrong or right
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
Wouldn't matter anyway
If my heart should shatter watching you
That'd be one less thing I'd have to prove
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
Heaven will be waiting when I fall into your open arms
I believe you'll find me there
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
That this could last forever
If only you could stay with me now
So tell me what it is
That keeps us from each other now
Yeah it's coming to get me
No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know
Can't stay forever like this
Just don't take forever
There's gotta be a way
For you and I together now
Yeah it's coming to get me
No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now
And I don't wanna know
Can't stay forever like this
Nothing is real this way
No I can't let you go
And I don't wanna know
I can't let you go no
And I don't wanna know
Tell you what you do to
Me every time I hear ya
More willing to wanna see ya
I know that there's no use in
Let's not talk about a
The very first time that I
I found my inspiration
So I put myself forward
For your consideration
Let's not talk about a
Let's not think about it
I'm finding it harder and harder to breath
And so we put the top down
I guess we'll know just what to do
It's too late to stop me
I know we're gonna get down
Let's not talk about a
Let's not think about it
I'm finding it harder and harder to breath
And after all this time my heart still burns for you
If you don't know by now that you're my only one
Take a look inside me and watch my heartstrings come undone
I know I promised you forever
Is there no stronger word I can use
To reassure you when the storm is raging outside
You're my safest place to hide
I need you like I needed you then
When I feel like giving up
I climb inside your heart I still find
You're my safest place to hide
You see colors no one else can see
In every breath you hear a symphony
You understand me like nobody can
I feel like my soul unfolding like a flower blooming
When this whole world gets too crazy
And there's nowhere left to go
I know you give me sanctuary
You're the only truth I know
You're the road back home
Standing here where I've always been
And when words are not enough
I climb inside your heart I'd still find
You're my safest place to hide
My safest place to hide
I know I promised you forever
There's no stronger word I can use
To reassure when the storm is raging outside
You're my safest place to hide
Standing here where I've always been
When I feel like giving up
I climb inside your heart I'd still find
When you come back I won't be here
She said and gently pulled me near
If you want to talk you can call
And no it's not your fault
I just smiled and said let go of me
But there's something that I've just gotta know
She said it's not my fault
Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
When the one you want doesn't want you too
I was drifted in between
In my dreams you are still here
Like you've always been
Was waiting for the lie to come true
When the one you want doesn't want you too
I gave myself away completely
But you just couldn't see me
Though I was sleeping in your bed
When I came back she wasn't there
Just a note left on the stairs
If you want to talk give me a call
My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
When the one you want doesn't want you too
When the one that you want doesn't want you
My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
When the one you want doesn't want you too
You showed me how to face the truth
Everything that's good in me I owe to you
Though the distance that's between us
Now may seem to be too far
It will never separate us
In my heart is where you are
Every step along the way
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye
I walk along these empty streets
There is not a second you're not here with me
Will always give me strength and be my cornerstone
To see the best I have in me
As long as time goes on
I swear to you that you will be
In my heart is where you are
Every step along the way
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye
I will see you somewhere down the road again
In my heart is where you are
Every step along the way
I know you would be forever in my life
Every step along the way
This one is for the mothers
Who left their hearts behind
This is for the strangers
And leave while it's still dark
This is a song for the unloved
This is a music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind
This one's for the bridesmaid
This one's for the dreamers
Who locked their faith inside
This is for the widows
Who think there's only one
The dying fathers that never told their sons
This is a song for the unloved
This is a music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind
Tomorrow the sun will shine
And dry the tears in your eyes
Suddenly love comes alive
This is a song for the unloved
This is a music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind
This is a song for the unloved
This is a music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind
Flooded all my empty space
You take away life's heartbreak
And now I feel so alive
I know that there must be
Finally I feel complete cause
You are rushed over me yeah
There no more blindness
And now I feel so alive
I know that there must be
Finally I feel complete cause
You are rushed over me
It's not enough just holding on
Before I met you I was lost
Now that you're standing here
I don't want you to go
I know that your love keeps me alive
And now I feel so alive
I know that there must be
Finally I feel complete cause
You are rushed over me
And now I feel so alive
I know that there must be
Finally I feel complete cause
Only one life to live in
We're trying our best to make it through
It's all about what they mean to you
No matter what you've gone through you can
Pick up the pieces move on with your life
We had to accept the wrong and try to make them right
It may be hard to look at yourself and see the truth
You've got to realize it takes time to become you
Living day by day by day everything must change
But in a way everything stays the same
Take what you've been given
Gotta take a chance while we can
To find our place in our world
We had to understand the plan
Put the past behind you and
Pick up the pieces move on with your life
You can look at yourself and see the truth
Realize it takes time to become you
Living day by day by day everything must change
But in a way everything stays the same
We know we've changed
But we're still the same
Getting closer to what we're supposed to be
As life goes on you'll have your time
Living day by day by day everything must change
But in a way everything stays the same
Too late to call this is not like me
But I'm still lifted from the tattoo on the small of your back
The angle of your chin when you were looking back
But I'm still floating on the perfume you left on my sheets
I haven't changed a thing since you abandoned me
Tonight I stare out the window
Knowing I'll never again be alone
Last night you changed my life
And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Last night you saved my life
Your fingernails running down my spine
All day I hear your voice like velvet in my mind
It's like I knew you all my life even though we just met
I had to stop myself from calling all day long
But you were laughing because I answered after just one ring
I tried to play it off
But you knew everything
Last night you changed my life
And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Last night you saved my life with your love
Last night you saved my life
I stare at the sky looking for the morning sun
Can't wait to tell you you're the only one
Last night you saved my life
And I was stuck in the moment you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Everybody on to the floor
I saw you pull to the back
And roll with the cream in the back
Like you wanna get funky
I hit the bar to buy you a drink
Feel you out to see how you think
I love the way you move
You got that body baby
Can't let you leave until we dance girl
Cause there'll be fire when we dance
It's all about the vibe and the mix
Let me sneak a kiss on the lips
I love the way you move
You got that body baby
I came to ask you for this dance girl
Cause there'll be fire when we dance
I ain't trying to take you home
Ain't no harm in moving your body here in the party
I just want your body here with me yeah
We're gonna be turning these up tonight
We're gonna be turning this out tonight
Can't let you leave until we dance
Cause there'll be fire when we dance
Can't let you leave until we dance
There'll be fire baby
Can't think of nothing but you
You are the reason I wake up in the morning
Lately I'm sleeping till two
Sometimes I swear that you are lying here beside me
I reach for you girl and you're not there
Still got the smell of your body on the pillow
Still finding strings of your hair
Tell me can we try baby
Can we get back to love again
Seems like I'm losing my best friend
Can you rescue me from the rain
And be my sunshine again
Can I make it up to you
I promise that I'll do anything for us
Cause baby I love you
Let's go back to love again
Don't wanna hurt anymore
Ain't nothing right and my world is going crazy
Ain't nothing left to live for

Can you rescue me from the rain
And be my sunshine again

Cause baby I love you
Let me tell you what I see through my eyes
Apathy is all around and on the rise
We channel so much energy through our greed
Which leads us to become absolved of those in need
Money can't buy lives
Living is more than profits accrued
We need to love and be loved
And brought in the things we are thankful of
Remember your brothers and sisters
Because we are all in this together
It's funny how we took a prayer out of schools
After the 9-11 scare that's all we do
We compromise our liberties for security
We can become so self in dosed that we can't see
Money can't buy lives
Living is more than profits accrued
We need to love and be loved
And brought in the things we are thankful of
Remember your brothers and sisters
Because we are all in this together
Don't throw in the towel
Let's overcome the test for now
Love will conquer all
Money can't buy lives
Living is more than profits accrued
We need to love and be loved
And brought in the things we are thankful of
Remember your brothers and sisters
Because we are all in this together
Money can't buy lives
Living is more than profits accrued
We need to love and be loved
And brought in the things we are thankful of
Remember your brothers and sisters
It forced me to think twice.
I'd be more than this.
Cause you made me understand...
Kisses in a bean bag chair
The two of us with no one there
The moment that I climb the stairs
To hold you in my arms after we made love.
Or kissing in the morning rain.
At the end of the day is that I've got you.
Where I can be myself.
Our love still remains.
We got the simple things cause...
Kisses in a bean bag chair
The two of us with no one there
The moment that I climb the stairs
To hold you in my arms after we made love.
Or kissing in the morning rain.
Is at the end of the day I've got you.
A Sunday morning with the blanket wrapped around your waist.
The way your lips seems to curve when you say my name.
Girl it all makes sense when you're around.
Kisses in a bean bag chair
The two of us with no one there
The moment that I climb the stairs
To hold you in my arms after we made love.
Or kissing in the morning rain.
Is at the end of the day I've got you.
Kisses in a bean bag chair
The two of us with no one there
The moment that I climb the stairs
To hold you in my arms after we made love.
Or kissing in the morning rain.
Brothers fighting brothers
Lovers fighting lovers
People barely caring anymore
Nations hating nations
Love is lost in the equation
Wondering why there is still so many wars
It's like this whole world's caught in
We could use some divine intervention
Find a solution to all this confusion
No one knowing where it's gonna go
We got too many too hungry
It's time to stop this suffering
And I don't think we can do it on our own
And right now we need something
We could use some divine intervention
Show us that our change is gonna come
Help us to replace the hate with love
Overflow our hearts with kindness
Help us lift the clouds out of our way
We could use some divine intervention
Find a solution to all this confusion
You know I been trying to figure out
I been doing a lot of thinking lately
And I'm really missing you
Since the last time I seen your pretty face
My decision to bring this to an end
It's been on my mind since Valentine's
I can't think straight
I was going through some things that I couldn't explain
Now my situation's taking a big change
They say the grass is greener on the other side of town
Now I'm kinda wishing you would come back around
Could've been strong and picked up the telephone
I can't think straight
It's water under the bridge
But I can't seem to forget
I still see your face
All this love I can't replace
I'm not over my my my love
I'm not over my my my love
I'm not over my my my love
Not over not over my love
Not over not over my love
I'm not over not over my love
You can tell me what you want
Girl you struck me like the sun
So just tell me how you wanna be done
I know you a couple of weeks
You seem like you don't play stupid tricks
I can imagine you must feel wonderful
I like to know what I need to do
Let me feel those hips
You can tell me what you wanna do
Girl I became your biggest fan
I could be your perfect man
You can tell me what you want
You can tell me what you need
I will do whatever you want
Just don't make my heart bleed
Girl don't you understand
That your wish is my command
So baby drop the match
Show me what's the task
And tell me everything you want
Girl you told me what was in the past
All the relationships that never last
No man ever let you be free
And oh you're fed up with the jealousy
I'll give you all the freedom that you need
Baby you and I will succeed
I like to know what I need to do
Let me kiss those lips
You can tell me what you wanna do
Don't want violated things and make you mad
Don't want violated things that make you sad
Let me just find it right here pretty lady
What if we loose all the money baby
What if there's nothing but you and me
Tell me what would you do pretty lady
Would you at least take care of me
You can tell me how you deal the stress
When everything becomes a big mess
We stay strong and fight it off
Spend your life with me baby
Spend your life with me baby girl
Spend your life with me baby
Spend your life with me baby girl
I love how loving you makes me feel
And I love how loving you feels so real
Through the good through the bad
When I'm happy or sad
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world
All my life I've dreamed of a princess all dressed in white
Standing there to be my bride and then there's you
A sending from Heaven right before my eyes
Letting me know that there is a God somewhere I know
Many people think they find love in the world
But this kind of love isn't found it finds you it takes you
I love how loving you makes me feel oh yeah
And I love how loving you feels so real so real baby
Through the good through the bad
When I'm happy or sad
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world
All my life I've wondered if I'd hear all the bells and whistles
If the one should come my way
Then there is you like the wind makes the earth shake
Making me a believer there must be a God somewhere I know
Many people think they find love in the world
But this kind of love isn't found it finds you it takes you
This kind of love doesn't come from just a touch
Nor does it come from anything you can't pay for
It's so pure if we just send love on in the world
And I love how loving you feels so real so real so real
Through the good through the bad the bad
When I'm happy or sad
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world
I love how loving you makes me feel
And I love how loving you feels so real
Through the good through the bad
When I'm happy or sad
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world
But when I look at you
We can't deny what's true
I can't help the way I feel
Cause you got me yeah
All these elements are real
They come from deep within me
I would move heaven and earth for this fire
Let this emotional wind take us higher
Where there's nothing we can't do
This power is greater than the forces of nature
We don't have no walls
Is waiting in your eyes
Just let me take it in
I can't help the way I feel
All these elements are real
They come from deep within me
I would move heaven and earth for this fire
Let this emotional wind take us higher
Where there's nothing we can't do
This power is greater than the forces of nature
Than the energy I get from loving you
It'll take us too forever
I would move heaven and earth for this fire
Let this emotional wind take us higher
I thought I heard you call
I'm a little scared knowing you're out there
Since you've been gone
Every day I miss you more
But I can't wait to say
These arms are here to hold you
Don't need to be afraid
To open up this door and I know that it's not much
So you lost your way but that's yesterday
And I don't care where you've been
Cause every step you've taking since you left
Has brought you back again
And I hope you see it clear
My love has always been right here
These arms are here to hold you
Don't need to be afraid
To open up this door and I know that it's not much
I'm glad you found your way
And I hope you are here to stay
These arms are here to hold you
Don't need to be afraid
To open up this door and I know that it's not much
Hey you're my favorite girl
Hang the sign up on the door
I say don't disturb this grove
All I need is just me and you
Just a way to say that I'm so into you
Just someone who understood
And the feelings so real
Don't disturb this grove
Erotic whispers for the listener
Let the music fill the air
Excuse me for a moment I'm at a loss for words
By election you're perfection
And as if these eyes would care
Your heart is in the right place so don't you go and change
Baby over and over the passion starts again
And the lollipops and everything with a little taste of sin
Causing fire and desire in this mortal soul to live
Till the angels fall from heaven and the day the earth stands still
Hang the sign up on the door
It says don't disturb this grove
All I need is just me and you
Just a way to say that I'm so into you
Just someone who understood
And the feelings so real
Don't disturb this grove
All I need is just me and you
Just someone who understood
And the feelings so real
Don't disturb this grove
Close your eyes and let the music put you in the mood
Ooh baby just lock the door and turn the phone off
It's time for me and you
Hang the sign up on the door
It says don't disturb this grove
All I need is just me and you
Just a way to say that I'm so into you
Just someone who understood
And the feelings so real
Don't disturb this grove
All I need is just me and you
Just someone who understood
And the feelings so real
Don't disturb this grove
But she got her own place
She made me wait too long
But you let me hit the second date yeah
She's always asking me for my
But girl you got your own
I'm always trying to teach her things
But her tricks fooled on
She didn't stick around
But now you hold me down
I've been there and I tell you now girl
But you are my everyone
That's why she used to be the one I'd fight for
She used to be the one I would cry for
Cause girl now you are the one I would die for
I thought I had everything still something was missing
She wouldn't do the things I like
But always knew you would
And I let you know you are so incredible
That's why I'm telling you
She used to be the one I'd fight for
She used to be the one I would cry for
Cause girl now you are the one I would die for
I thought I had everything still something was missing
No more wondering just where we stand
No more feeling like I'm the other man
Girl I need to know if you are down to stay
She used to be the one I'd fight for
She used to be the one I would cry for
Cause girl now you are the one I would die for
I thought I had everything still something was missing
Used to fight for her
I used to fight for her
I used to fight for her
I thought I had everything still something was missing
I used to fight for her
I used to fight for her
The love I left behind
I still think about it all the time
Nothing stays the same
I've seen a thousand lies
And it's taken years to realize
That nothing stays the same
And no one is to blame
And only time will tell you what is meant to be
Holding all the dreams I used to know
I wish it was the same
I guess no one's to blame
The love I left behind
I wish it was the same
I guess no one's to blame
No no nothing stays the same
And everything must change
Everybody needs affection
Looking for a deep connection
So put a little bit of love in my life today
Everybody needs some shelter
Let's spend a little time together
Let them tell you what I wanna say
Take a picture of what you think of love
Looks like in your imagination
Write on my soul everything you know
Use every word you ever heard
I've had enough of not believing
Living life without a meaning
I want something real
And I feel it when I'm next to you
Let's vow to have some love and devotion
Winner to my heart's emotions
It's the place I'm gonna keep you in
Take a picture of what you think of love
Looks like in your imagination
Use every word that you ever heard
Let's make a world for you and me yeah
Take a picture of what you think of love
Looks like in your imagination
Use every word you ever heard
Use every word you ever heard
Everybody needs affection
Looking for a deep connection
Some people got to have it
Some people really need it
For the love of money
People will steal from their mother
For the love of money
People will rob their own brother
For the love of money
People can't even walk the street
Because they never know who in the world they're gonna beat
For the love of money
For the love of money
People don't care who they hurt or beat
For the love of money
A woman will sell her precious body
For a small piece of paper it carries a lot of weight
I know money is the root of all evil
Do funny things to some people
Money can drive some people out of their minds
How many things have I heard you say
Some people really need it
How many things have I heard you say
How many things have I heard you say
For the love of money
All for the love of money
For the love of money
Money can change people sometimes
Money can fool people sometimes
Love Knows I Love You
You make me say it 25 times a day
You make me feel you don't believe the words I say
I can send flowers tomorrow
But it doesn't mean a thing
If your heart rejects the message from mine
Baby love knows I love you
Baby love knows the truth
Baby love knows the feeling that is in here
You make me feel like a child in a candy store
What can I do to prove
That you're a dream come true
And in this dream there's a pulse from my heart to you
I can send daisies daily
But it never will penetrate
If your heart if rejects the best from mine
Baby love knows the truth
Baby love knows the feeling that is in here
Can I tie him in a ball and chain
To see if he can say to you
Baby love knows I love you
Baby love knows the truth
Baby love knows the feeling that is in here
When I'm down on my luck and I'm searching for my soul
When I'm feeling too much and I start to lose control
When I'm down so low that even enemies don't wanna know
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low
When your arms are around me
I don't wanna let you go
When I'm lost along the way and I can't face another day
And if I stumble on the road and if I can't carry the load
Say you understand my pain
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low
When your arms are around me
I don't wanna let you go
You helped me carry the load
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low
Lift me up like an angel when I hit the ground
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low
When your arms are around me
I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
I love you with everything that's in me
You'll be the first that's ever been so close
I've been loving you since the beginning
For what it's worth I've always been waiting for this moment
One special night for one special girl
Let's make love like it's our last day on Earth
With everything I am I promise it will be
Much sweeter than you ever could dream
Let's do it tonight baby
Never had a reason to believe that love would find me
It must've known something that I didn't know
And you showed me that if I had a chance to go to heaven
Girl I'd stay here cause nothing could make me miss this moment
One special night for one special girl
Let's make love like it's our last day on Earth
With everything I am I promise it will be
Much sweeter than you ever could dream
Let's do it tonight baby
I can't think of any place I'd rather be than here with you
It's the way you look into my eyes
That lets me know just what you wish it's for a night like this
One special night for one special girl
Let's make love like it's our last day on Earth
With everything I am I promise it will be
Much sweeter than you ever could dream
Let's do it tonight baby
Let's do it tonight baby
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love that's made for you
Walking along the sky
Chasing a glimpse of you
Painting a world with stars I found inside your eyes
Up here above the haze
Everything looks so clear
Wondering what it would be like if you were here
To tell you how I feel
You're everything but mine
I hold you close when it all goes crazy
You don't have to be afraid
Of somebody else's touch
Just gimme a chance to prove
Just how you should be loved
To tell you how I feel
You're everything but mine
I hold you close when it all goes crazy
I'm gonna leave the light on
And I won't let you down
No I won't let you down
You're everything but mine
I hold you close when it all goes crazy
You're everything but mine
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor
I wanna let you walk away tonight
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
Baby I don't want to waste another day
Keeping it inside is killing me
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I memorized the number
Keeping it inside is killing me
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I don't wanna be like this
I just wanna let you know
Everything that I hold in
Is everything I can't let go
Keeping it inside is killing me
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
Don't you know it baby
I don't wanna waste another day
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
And seven nights of empty tries
But it's never gonna work this time
We're to the point of no return
And along the way the only thing we've learned
Is how to hurt each other
It took so long to realize
All these years of standing still
Still we'll stay in all this pain
I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
Baby you're not in it
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute
Something that I already know
Something that I already know
Don't waste your breath
Can't you see we're at the end
And it's finally come to this
I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
Baby you're not in it
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute
Something that I already know
I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
Baby you're not in it
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute
Something that I already know
Something that I already know
Something that I already know
She keeps the secrets in her eyes
She wraps the truth inside her lies
And just when I can't take what she's done to me
And leads me back to paradise
She's so hard to hold
I'm a house of cards in a hurricane
A reckless ride in the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain is all I wanna feel
She dances away just like a child
She opens up just like a rose to me
When she's close to me
I'm a house of cards in a hurricane
A reckless ride in the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain is all I wanna feel
She dances away just like a child
I'm a house of cards in a hurricane
A reckless ride in the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain is all I wanna feel
She dances away just like a child
Just when I'm trying to get over you.
I can't seem to comprehend
Now you're carved out a life
Reminding me by the hour
That its time to accept it's the way things are
I wish I could but...
Can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Since you drained all the color out of the sky
How am I supposed to feel
It's like I'm living in somebody else's life
Tell me it's not real...
Can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Like we never had a falling out
Since you drained all the color out of the sky
Can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
She wakes up with the sun
She throws on her clothes
Hoping her car will start
The second time around
The lines out the door
Until she can't take anymore
I see it in her broken smile
You're one in a million
You're gonna work it out someday
I wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
But you never even look my way
Her makeup is smeared
Wiping the tears that she wants no one to see
She screams on the pain
How beautiful you are
Just see it in my broken smile
You're one in a million
You're gonna work it out someday
I wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
But you never even look my way
If I could be the light
If I could be the one
To change the ending to your story
I'd be one in a million
Someday I will tell her
You're gonna work it out someday
You're one in a million
You're gonna work it out someday
I wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
But you never even look my way
You're one in a million
You're gonna work it out someday
I wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
When I see you around
And you know it's dragging me down
You're so conflicted baby
One step and every thing's over
And you're running back to me
You say I let you down
Baby take me in or just take me out
You're not immune to the panic
When the snow hits your skin
The cold don't last forever
If you don't let seasons change
And you're running back to me
You say I let you down
Baby take me in or just take me out
How many times do I have to say it
Before you believe me
And you're running back to me
You say I let you down
Baby take me in or just take me out
I could see in your eyes
Lately nowhere to be found
Don't you know that I'm your place to run
You've been holding on so long
And there ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
Sifting through the shattered dreams
Living in the in between
I will always be by your side
Don't be afraid when you're falling apart
Don't hesitate I'll be right where you are
There's a crack in the dark
You locked it somewhere deep inside
When the whole world turns against you
I won't turn against you
When the whole world turns against you
You've been holding on so long
And there ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
How come you never know what you've got
How fool was I into thinking I was gonna be all right... okay... fine
So every day I try a little harder to forget her
I'm here to convince myself tomorrow will be better
The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind when I close my eyes at night
The trouble is there's a part of me that still can't let go of her memory
And now I know what it is love is what the trouble is
How come she said you'll never wear your heart
How stupid was I into thinking I was gonna be all right... okay... fine
So every day I find a little something to remind me
The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind when I close my eyes at night
The trouble is there's a part of me that still can't let go of her memory
Now I know what it is
Love is what the trouble is
The first night that we met
From that point in time
It was always you and I shining
Later out with your friends
You treat me like I'm dead
It was like I'm invisible
That was unforgettable
I just wanna let you know
Situation's unlivable
Tell me why you say that you want me
When all you ever do girl is push all my buttons
You always bring me down in public
When nobody's around you say that you love me
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around
And you treat me right
I'm not someone you can just disrespect
How would you feel if you were in my shoes
The situation's critical
Relationship is pitiful
Tell me why you say that you want me
When all you ever do girl is push all my buttons
You always bring me down in public
When nobody's around you say that you love me
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around
And you treat me right
You're just no good for me
You're no good for me
You're just no good for me
I know you're no good for me
It's wrong to treat me cold
I have no one to hold
One day I'm gonna say goodbye
Cause girl I'm gonna leave
Unless you turn around
So tell me why you say that you want me
When all you ever do girl is push all my buttons
You always bring me down in public
When nobody's around you say that you love me
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around
And you treat me right
So tell me why you say that you want me
When all you ever do girl is push all my buttons
You always bring me down in public
When nobody's around you say that you love me
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around
I'll just scream it in my mind
Nothing good in life is scripted
It's not like we predicted
That the one you want
Is gonna be the one you thought
But I won't live like a prisoner
Nothing has to be so perfect
Can you tell me was it worth it
Because the heart can't lie
And even though the face may try
Love can keep you up all night
Cause love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
And next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You've got a taste of sweet divine
Took you to the other side
Love will keep you up all night
If I don't tell a living soul
It's always 3 am somewhere
You know it when you get there
See people try to cover it up
Some people think it's never enough
Cause love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
And next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You've got a taste of sweet divine
I don't mean to scare you
But everybody has a first time
But one day when you're old and gray
Don't look back and never say
You should have tried
Cause love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
And next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You've got a taste of sweet divine
Cause love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
And next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You could be anyone today
Maybe I will recognize you on a crowded street
Maybe you'll take me by surprise
When you'll walk out of my dreams
Baby how can I be sure
That you're the one I'm waiting for
People say to watch our life
Desperately waiting on a chance
I know you're out there
Are we gonna know the time is right
What if you're here and I'm just blind
When you'll walk out of my dreams
Baby how can I be sure
That you're the one I'm waiting for
How do I know how this will end
When you'll walk out of my dreams
Baby how can I be sure
How come I was the last to know
Took the stage then you stole the show
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
I was captured by that stare
Now I'm shattered but I don't care
That I kissed your face
Till the sun was in our eyes
Till the afternoon arrived
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon
Monday is a funny thing
Still waiting for the phone to ring
How decidedly my life has changed
In a moment it was rearranged
Strange how easy it is letting go.
Like the sun was in my eyes
And now I'm running blind
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon
Is this the end or only the beginning
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon
I've been walking around
Between the lines of reason
Hiding from the ghost
Feels like I'm barely breathing
And let it all just wash away
I wanna feel the rain
I still can't face the sun
I've gone completely numb
I just wanna need someone
And let it all just wash away
I wanna feel the rain
I thought you were the only
I've been walking around inside a haze
And let it all just wash away
I wanna Feel the rain
And let it all just wash away
I wanna feel the rain
In a downpour feel the rain
So I lay awake another hour
Just like the one before
The shadows play a game with my head
I can't take this anymore
It makes me miss you more
Wake me up when it's over
When the damage has all been done
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me
Just leave me here in pieces
I can't take the chance
When I'll be on my feet
Wake me up when it's over
When the damage has all been done
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me
Just leave me here in pieces
If you want you can find me
On the dark side of the sun
Babe I don't wanna see what we've become
The damage has all been done
Wake me up when it's over
Wake me up when it's over
When the damage has all been done
I don't wanna be somewhere
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me as I bleed
Leave me here in pieces
Just leave me in pieces
Just leave me in pieces
Just wake me up when it's over
Finding the strength inside the gray
Maybe I need to get a grip
In the end no matter what I do
Nowhere to go but you
Try to bring nothing out of something
Promised myself I wouldn't care
Find a crack in my resistance
Find a way to wear me down
In the end no matter what I do
Nowhere to go but you
Every single road I take... it's you
Asleep or wide awake... it's you
For maybe one to save me
In the end no matter what I do
Waiting on the moment you decide
To leave me stranded on the edge of nowhere
I've been so close to you so many times
I feel like I could drown
I wish that I could fly away from here
But I'm still coming down
Now I'm pulling to your gravity
I'm falling through the night
Like a lonely satellite
Like a lonely satellite
With walks on Jupiter
Fool around the moon a time or two
Left a mark on every star we could find
But now I'm burning like a meteor
That never hits the ground
Wish that I could fly away from you
But I'm still coming down
Now I'm pulling to your gravity
I'm falling through the night
Like a lonely satellite
Love is poisoning the atmosphere
Is keeping everything unclear to me
Something in your eyes
Like a lonely satellite
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor
And my shirts turning red
Felt her lips on my neck
And her voice in my ear
Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
But I can't leave her alone
Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor
Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Straight through my heart
First off I can't keep a promise
I'm no one to count on at all
Add on that I'm a coward
To scared to return your calls
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
Its known that I'm a liar
Often I'm blacker than white
Add on my uncanny ego
No one's less humbled than I
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
All the messed up things I do
Before you're going heaven knows
Just let me make it better
I'll try to measure up
I'll try to measure up to you
I'll make it up to you
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You should be right here laying next to me
But baby you chose to love the hard way
You could be right here getting the best of me
But baby you decided he was your man
And now that you're finding out
You say you want me around
But I'm not sure now if I wanna be down
I think I wanna stay single
Maybe we're better apart
See I don't want a girl
Crazy how the tables turn
And you were quick to move on to the next day
And now that you're finding out
You say you want me around
But I'm not sure now if I wanna be down
I think I wanna stay single
Maybe we're better apart
See I don't want a girl
I'm not the one you really wanted be to fall
See I don't want a girl
See I don't want a girl
Can we spend this life together
Be a shield from rain and weather
Baby tell me can I be your man
Girl I promise to be faithful
But you really need to give us a chance
Please don't change the way you are
Soon you'll live within my heart
You've been searching for it all of your life
Don't be scared to try again
You can rest upon a chance
You've been searching for it all of your life
Can I be the one you trust
Be your friend I'll give you all
All of the things you dream of
Tell me can I be your man
There's a wound I wanna heal
If you need me I'll be here
Here to fix what broke
Let me change the life you live
Please don't change the way you are
Soon you'll live within my heart
You've been searching for it all of your life
Don't be scared to try again
You can rest upon a chance
You've been searching for it all of your life
You've been searching for it
You've been searching for it
Don't change the way you are
Searching for it all of your life
Please don't change the way you are
Soon you'll live within my heart
You've been searching for it all of your life
Don't be scared to try again
You can rest upon a chance
You've been searching for it all of your life
Please don't change the way you are
Soon you'll live within my heart
You've been searching for it all of your life
Don't be scared to try again
You can rest upon a chance
You've been searching for it all of your life
Life should be like a game of cards
Then fold the deck and start over
Get lost and your navigation system
But there ain't no handbook
When it comes to love
Wish I could take back
I don't need you around
So I would treat you the best
Yeah I would treat you the best
Wish I get remote controls
Then I just rewind into
The time it was better
It should have a restart button
To the day that I met her
But there ain't no handbook
When it comes to love
Wish I could take back
I don't need you around
So I would treat you the best
Yeah I would treat you the best
When it comes to love
See once you do something
Wish I could take back
I don't need you around
So I would treat you the best
Yeah I would treat you the best
I don't need you around
So I would treat you the best
Yeah I would treat you the best
Got a million reasons to run and hide
I would change the stories ending to me and you
Don't know the meaning of pretending what to do
Forget what he has done to you
Love will set you free
If ever you believe it
I know everything isn't meant to last
Box up all those photographs
I could flip back over that hour glass
And it's a miracle how broken hearts can mend
Wont you dry up all those tear drops and start again
Forget what he has done to you
Love will set you free
If ever you believe it
If I could show you there's no risk of being left alone
Would you let your past go
Cause there's no need to rush when I know
Forget what he has done to you
Love will set you free
If ever you believe it
Over a triple X movie screen
I couldn't care less about being seen
I say baby do you think
Sugar so sweet should rot my teeth
But instead it just rottens me
Public display of affection
Pointing in my direction
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
Remember at the beach we brought the sheets
We were harassed by police
Good thing we didn't go too deep
Everywhere we be the passion in me just screams
I just need you in my reach
Baby your suspense can be intense
You're the fingers to my instrument
Public display of affection
Pointing in my direction
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
From the lobby to the patio
And we're so compatible
And we're so compatible
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
Public display of affection
This scene's so hypnotic
It's got me losing control
Wanna play in this game of disguise
So won't you stay and dance with me
All through the night and day
So stay with me tonight
Just like a perfect dream
I don't ever wanna leave
A thousand freaks in the show
One's a king that suffering
Wanna play in this game of disguise
So won't you stay and dance with me
All through the night and day
So stay with me tonight
I gotta know the girl behind the mask
Dreamed that I had her alone
So won't you stay and dance with me
All through the night and day
So won't you stay and dance with me
All though the night and day
So stay with me tonight
She's a dream... yeah...
I'm first class every flight.
She can realize that she's a dream...
That's why I make her say... Ooh
Shorty don't know who I am...
I even got a lot to her
Ain't nobody treat her like I do her.
Like 3 or 4 times a week
She don't even know I've been around the world
And all the different girls and me.
She's the only one for me
That's why I make her say... Ooh
It's not good to fuss
But It wouldn't work if she ever gave
As I'm left with my tears on the floor
But you keep tearing a hole
In the middle of my heart
I've been fighting for too long
Could it be that I'm just waiting
And put the pieces together again
In the middle of my heart
I've been fighting for too long
And now I'm shattered
If you never really loved me
I gave my all but it still wasn't enough
Looking for commitment
And scattered them on the ground
Take our pictures off the walls tonight
I don't wanna see you no more
I don't wanna feel you no more
I hope you finally get what you want
I didn't wanna live without you
I didn't wanna love without you
I used to think I'd die without you
That we can be undone
I can't feel without you
You know I can't deal without you
And now I got a life without you
That we can be undone
This constant echoing
You seem so unaffected
While I go on in this hell
Take our pictures off the walls tonight
I don't wanna see you no more
I don't wanna feel you no more
I hope you finally get what you want
I didn't wanna live without you
I didn't wanna love without you
I used to think I'd die without you
That we can be undone
I can't feel without you
You know I can't deal without you
And now I got a life without you
That we can be undone
And I'm holding on is a real phrase
And it's dragging me along to my grave
It's dragging me to my grave
And I'm holding on is a real phrase
And it's dragging me along to my grave
I didn't wanna live without you
I didn't wanna love without you
I used to think I'd die without you
That we can be undone
That we could be undone
I didn't wanna live without you
I didn't wanna love with you
I used to think I'd die without you
That we can be undone
I wake up every morning and see your face
Lying right beside me it fills the space
I can't live without you
Don't wanna figure right how to
And every time I lay my head down to sleep
The emptiness inside of me starts to beat
I can't hear the sound
I fall in love all over again
It takes a piece of me
I feel it in my chest
I witness every trick you got up your sleeve
But still somehow you keep on surprising me
I can't live without you
Don't wanna figure right how to
Every time I see you I feel like I
Could be the luckiest man in the world
There's no need to hide it
I fall in love all over again
It takes a piece of me
I feel it in my chest
Every time I close my eyes
You're the first thing that runs to my mind
I just wanna be near you
Last thing you said is how dare you
First thing I said is I'm sorry
Now she's brokenhearted
Time heals all the wounds
Everyone plays a fool
Took advantage of a woman who loved me
I fall in love all over again
It takes a piece of me
I feel it in my chest
I just wanna take you everywhere that I go
Girl I want you in a plane in a
Seat right next to mine
Baby I could give you ways
Now I don't usually meet
You're like the perfect girl
I'm just too scared to know
That I'm gonna leave without
You can call me a man
That this ain't the kind of love
One night and then it's over
I ain't never fell in love so quickly
Baby please come with me
All you need is my love in a bag
I just wanna take you everywhere that I go
Girl I want you in a plane in a
Seat right next to mine
Baby I could give you ways
Girl I can think of only one
And no one else and dance to you
Were like the perfect team
No matter where I go you gotta roll
I bet they know about you
And I'm not leaving without
And I don't need to read your mind
That you want to see the world
And I could say that all I need is
One night and then well be closer
I ain't never fell in love so quickly
Baby please come with me
I see your shadow even when you're not standing there
I feel you when I close my eyes
I've been through It all and made It out alive
It's only just a matter of time
Pieces would come together
And I promise you baby
That I've tried but I can't try no more
And I've cried but I can't cry no more
And I've tried but I can't try no more
And I've cried but I can't cry no more
It's just so impossible going...
It's impossible going...
I hear you walking through the halls
And I know you're not home
The thought of you is all that remains
I wonder if I call would you pick up the phone
And tell me that you're feeling the same
The pieces will come together
I'm not giving up baby
And I've cried but I can't cry no more
And I've tried but I can't try no more
And I've cried but I can't cry no more
It's just so impossible going...
It's impossible going...
It's just so impossible
I got an empty bed on my right side
I'm missing you now for a life time
And I promise you baby
That I've tried but I can't try no more
And I've tried but I can't try no more
And I've cried but I can't cry no more
It's just so impossible going...
It's just so impossible going...
It's just so impossible going...
It's just so impossible going
In a world like this where some back down
In a world like this where people fall apart
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart
In a world like this where some back down
In a world like this where people fall apart
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart
In a world like this where some back down
In a world like this where people fall apart
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart
I want to say just for the record
That you still got my heart and my soul
You know we're worlds apart
No one else can teach me how to love again
How you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it
Some try to break through the walls
No one else can teach me how to love again
How you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it
You left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it
One should... with time
No one else can teach me how to love again
How you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it
You left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it
Your coat on the chair and the scent of your hair I miss
The clock on the wall it reminds me of all the better times
When we walked in the park and we whispered in the dark
And we laughed and cried
You know I can't Breathe
What's up with those tears in your eyes
And all the amber lights turned into red
You decorate it with velvet drapes
Outside you see the dark woods
But you don't know there's fields of gold ahead
The sun will come out again
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
Remember when we used to sit and watch from the bridge
And wonder where the ships would go
Who was on and what they would find out
You wrote it in a notebook
And said someday that this would be a story to tell
Something stole your tears and wiped your smile away
Hold on and you'll know
The sun will come out again
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
Let the sunshine warm your heart today
The sun will come out again
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
I've seen it all a thousand times
So hard to breathe when the water's high
You find the truth in a child's eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof I see myself in you
When walls start to close in
Your heart is frozen over
When sun light is fading
The world will be waiting for you
You gotta stand for something
It's gonna be all right
You find the truth in a child's eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof I see myself in you
When walls start to close in
Your heart is frozen over
When sun light is fading
The world will be waiting for you
You find the truth in a child's eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof I see myself in you
When walls start to close in
Your heart is frozen over
When sun light is fading
The world will be waiting for you
We can only make believe
We can only make believe
Something that you said got into my head
Here I am falling from the edge
Like angels on fire we burn the sky
One kiss and we say goodbye
If we could only make believe
We can be king and queen
Rule another world forever
We'd set our course to live or die
Across the universe I'll be by your side
If we could only believe
We can only make believe
We can only make believe
This love I have is pulling me to death
Waiting for the night I can feel alive with you...
Like angels on fire we burn the sky
One kiss and we say goodbye
If we could only make believe
We can be king and queen
Rule another world forever
We'd set our course to live or die
Across the universe I'll be by your side
If we could only believe
Let our hearts collide
Leave the world outside
Let our hearts collide
Leave the world outside
Leave the world outside
If we could only make believe
We can be king and queen
Rule another world forever
We'd set our course to live or die
Across the universe I'll be by your side
Let our hearts collide
Leave the world outside
Let our hearts collide
Leave the world outside
Seems like there's just no way how
Feels like it's all gone wrong
My shoulder is yours if you need to cry
Feel the times when life is just too much
Give me a moment of your time
I know you're hurt now
It's always been just me and you
Always when I needed you
Give me a moment of your time
I know you're hurt now
It's my favorite time if we just
Give me a moment of your time
I know you're hurt now
Let me tell you about this girl I know
First glance and damn she stole my heart
Hold me back just the way she moves
And the way you do your thing
Oh you're mesmerizing me
And the feeling is so real
You've got to call me
You've got to trust me
Underneath the willow tree
The grass is greener on the other side
There's no other side when it's you and I
I can never get enough of your blue eyes
Just another butterfly sigh
You've got to call me
You've got to trust me
Oh lets believe that well find out
How it feels with something so right
Don't you think it's time
To let your guard down
You've got to call me
You've got to trust me
You've got to call me
You've got to trust me
Is it too much to ask for
Cause you take my breath away
You're the reason why cave men drew on the walls
The reason why after every summer we fall
You're the reason I never wanna sleep at night
Cause nothing that I could dream
It's better the you by my side
When you wake up with no make up
How beautiful you are in me
You're the reason why cave men drew on the wall
It's the reason why after every summer we fall
And the way that you look in those purple jeans
It's the sexiest thing I ever see
I'm so in love I can die right now and be fine I need you tonight
You wear the jersey of my favorite team
You're not even mad of me
You know I love you baby
It's almost a year since
Every single night like its 25 to life
Always be my one phone call
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging pretty baby please come home
Always be my one phone call
I can't help but think of the first time I saw you
Every single night feels like 25 to life
Always be my one phone call
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging pretty baby please come home
Always be my one phone call
So let me make my case
That way you won't erase the message
That I'm leaving for you now
But if you do at least you knew
Always be my one phone call
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging pretty baby please come home
Always be my one phone call
You'll always be my one
You'll always be my one
Always be my one phone call
Been down the back roads
Where the girls are homegrown
That southern dame's so
Sexy how they talk slow
And something happens in the woods of Kentucky
Where the sweet tequila flows
They got something you can't teach
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
Seeing things I'd never thought
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
So many things to see
I couldn't count them all if I had eternity
So I just want you to know
You take a piece of me
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
Protect you like a soldier.
Be the one to save your life
All I wanna do is hold you.
Right in the middle of a war outside
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier.
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier
You don't have to hide your scars
I'll be there when you fall apart
You don't have to go too far
Now that battle is over.
Right in the middle of a war outside
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier.
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier.
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier.
Right in the middle of a war outside
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier.
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier.
And if your heart is getting colder
You didn't even stop once to think twice
Drove through the pouring rain
Weaved in and out of pain
Wish I'd have done it now
I still remember how we left it that night
Said it was better if we both just moved along
But if you're telling me it's not the last time
I'll find a way to reignite the spark
Drove through the pouring rain
Weaved in and out of pain
Wish I'd have done it now
I still remember how we left it that night
Said it was better if we both just moved along
But if you're telling me it's not the last time
So if you ever feel the need
Jump in your car and just drive back to me
So if you ever feel the need
Jump in your car and just drive back to me
I still remember how we left it that night
Said it was better if we both just moved along
But if you're telling me it's not the last time
Out in the darkest place
With this a thousand shades of blue
Everyone looks the same
And then your light came into view
It's like you fell above of the sky to save me
An angel from the sun
My future it's with you from tonight
And when I touch your face
It's shows me worlds I never known
Frozen in time and space
Don't want to let this moment go
It's like you fell above of the sky to save me
An angel from the sun
My future it's with you from tonight
My future it's with you from tonight
All the tears inside are raindrops
All the sadness in my lifetime
All I need is someone
You're the good luck charm
You're the reason for the rainbows
God knows I'd hate to see you
Baby don't leave me this way
If you stay I'll give you what you want
I'll show you I'm the only one for you
I just wanna constantly be with you
It's only when you're around
All the problems solve my problems
All the clouds inside my garden roll away
If you stay I'll give you what you want
I'll show you I'm the only one for you
Brings me victory as a promise
My frustrations and my losses fly high away
If you stay I'll give you what you want
I'll show you I'm the only one for you
There's a spark of magic in your eyes
You're a genie in disguise
Full of wonder and surprise
Your the one that I've been waiting for forever
To express all he feels inside
But ever just so often
Seem to work our just fine
Tonight I saw a glimpse of your
Reflection oh you looked
A tear ran down my face
And all my memories erased
Oh why did you have to leave my side
Oh why do all the rivers flow into the ocean
And why does all the love in the world come straight from the heart
And why does all the pain I feel come from deep inside
Oh all these questions I could have answered
If you were by my side
Something made me look at you
Something made me talk to you
Something made me do what I should
I want you by my side
I want you by my side
Now every day the pain I feel
And all the memories of you and me
Are always here to stay
Oh what I'm asking girl
To let me in your life
Oh girl if you give me one more chance
Then I could be right by your side
Something made me look at you
Something made me talk to you
Something made me do what I should
I want you by my side
I want you by my side
But now nothing feels the same
Just another textbook case of
When I should have left love alone
Maybe I should have listen when they said
Don't try this at home
But that's what I'm saying now
Just another textbook case of
When I should have left love alone
Maybe I should have listen when they said
Don't try this at home
Said I was Playing with fire
When I should have left love alone
Maybe I should have listen when they said
Don't try this at home
Call me crazy but I've been here before
And I promised myself I wouldn't fall
But looking now I'm so lost
I guess I'm gonna have to learn the hard way because
I have a problem with one thing I shouldn't touch
I know that love is dangerous
When I should have left love alone
Maybe I should have listen when they said
Don't try this at home
I don't want you thinking I'm a bad guy
Sometimes I say some things
That I don't really mean
The last thing that I want is you mad at me
I know I know what I got to do
To get a get a smile out of you
Make my lips touch my nose
Cross my eyes until I go blind
Every time I think your sad I just make a funny face
Even when I make you mad I put on my funny face
It tickles me to see your trying not to laugh at me
I know you want to laugh come on
Laugh with me come on
Every time I think your sad I just make a funny face
Even when I make you mad I put on my funny face
You stick your tongue out
No matter what you do I can stay mad at you
And you can stay mad at me
So what we going to do
Every time I think your sad I just make a funny face
Even when I make you mad I put on my funny face
I don't think I want this anymore
As she drops the ring to the floor
She says to herself you've left before
This time you will stay gone that's for sure
And he shattered something else
To drag her suitcase down the path
She had never gone that far
Normally this would be the time that she
Would let him talk her out of leaving
As she got into her car
I'll never let another teardrop fall
As she drove away she starts to smile
Realized she hadn't for awhile
No destination she drove for miles
Wondering why she stayed in such denial
She was laughing about the way he shattered something else as
He dragged her suitcase down the path
She had never gone that far
Normally this would be the time that she
Would let him talk her out of leaving
As she got into her car
I'll never let another teardrop fall
She inhales a breath she never breathed before
Don't want no drama no more
That just ain't for me
I know I deserve better after all
I'll love you forever
Let's make a toast to our love
I'll love you forever
Let's make a toast to our love
The love we have can touch the sky
It's just enough love for you and me
Your love came from up above
So we'll always stay together
We must keep that forever
I'll love you forever
Let's make a toast to our love
I'll love you forever
Let's make a toast to our love
We sip the champagne as a symbol of love
We want everyone to know just how much
It's so amazing another can rely
Your love came from up above
So we'll always stay together
We must keep that forever
I'll love you forever
Let's make a toast to our love
I'll love you forever
Let's make a toast to our love
I'll love you forever
The way she wear it is dangerous
She walk around me like a predator
Something she play with and leave alone
And I can't help it but to let her use me
And every little thing she do just makes me want her more
As sexy candle but so much hotter
Pain is just pleasure with the volume up
I'm spending all my money on her
No matter where I go there she is
And every little thing she do just makes me want her more
And every little thing she do just makes me want her more
And every little thing she do just makes me want her more
That our feelings would never keep us apart
But I never knew it was only for fun
Tell me that I'm dreaming
Say you're never leaving
Don't you wanna be with me
Tell me that I'm dreaming
Say you're never leaving
You're heart will be safe you'll see
There will always be that day
Oh how I know that summer days are getting longer
Oh how I know that my love is getting stronger
Girl if you only knew
Just how much I really love you
I think about you night and day
My love for you will always stay
I never knew it was only for fun
You and me girl we were meant to be
Together forever in harmony yeah
Everybody groove to the music
We've been waiting so long
Just can't hold it back no more
It's time for me to let it go
If you really wanna see what we can do for you
I get ruthless when I get wet keep the party packed in my corner
Tough like granite to keep the crowd hype get up on this just to get right
If you really wanna see what we can do for you
We've been waiting so long just can't hold it back no more
Time for me to let it go
Everybody groove to the music
I'll never find someone like you
I know my love is true when we're together
When I looked up you were saying goodbye
I'll never find someone like you
All I have is just my heart and my feelings I give to you
Girl I'm afraid just to give you the world
My heart still it needs to hold on to my love
I start to get weak and I can't let you go
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
I'd walk halfway around the world
For just one kiss from you
Far beyond the call of love
As long as your love's there to lead me
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Is all I'm ever gonna need
I used to think that dreams were just
For sentimental fools
And I'd never find someone
Who'd give their love so true
But I knew the very minute
Couldn't live my life without you in it
And now I want the whole wide world to know
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Is all I'm ever gonna need
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Is all I'm ever gonna need
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Is all I'm ever gonna need
Yes I know it's too late
But I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
That I want it that way
I never wanna hear you say
Yes I know it's too late
But I want it that way
I never wanna hear you say
Now I can see that we've fallen apart
No matter the distance I want you to know
That deep down inside of me
Don't wanna hear you say
I never wanna hear you say
I never wanna hear you say
I never wanna hear you say
With my heart like this
You'll be mine forever
And you that I'm right
How could you love me
When I can't sleep at night
Without holding you tight
I just break down and cry
Although we've come to
Still I can't let you go
Still I can't let you go
It's only your first time
Can you love me again
Like you loved me before
Girl I'm here for you
All those times of night
When you just hurt me
With that other fella
You just don't understand
I'm not out to go out and
Cheat on you all night
Just like you did baby
Till my dying day baby
I know he's driving... a fancy car
When you're with him you're feeling like a star
But when I'm at home alone... I think only of you
If you two were so in love I couldn't tell... baby
So let's take some time out... to find a way
And I promise I will make of our own
And if you're ever in need
Put your full trust in me
And I will never leave you at home...
There are people who say what you wanna hear
Even on a rainy day they'll tell you the sky is clear
When you really really love someone am I right
When I say that you want them near
And if you care you even tell them things
The simple lies that she said
I will never leave you
All the love I thought she had
But can you blame me no
Cause that's what she said
She told me we'd see forever
That's what she said she said yeah
Who say what they really mean
She said she'd always be there
She said she'd always care
But just when you think that you can trust that someone you love
Tell me why do I know that stars can fall from above
Those simple lies that she said
I will never leave you
All the love I thought she had
But can you blame me no
Cause that's what she said
She told me we'd see forever
That's what she said she said
But you're not hurting yourself
You're only hurting me
Why would you say things that you really didn't mean
Oh how can I make you see just what you did to me
Ooh you said how much you really care
Just when I thought I was in love
Girl how could you care
If I were you I could not lie even once to the face of the one
Those simple lies she said
I will never leave you
All the love I thought she had.
But can you blame me no
Cause that's what she said
She told me we're see forever
She told me we'd be together.
I tried to pick the pieces up
And I can't think of starting over
We used to share the stars above
I don't wanna think it changed
And now I gotta move on
I've gotta catch up to the world
Even though I gave you my life
As wrong as it seems I know it's right
But is there a trace that I can go away
To escape the love that I will forever know
All I know is that I love you still
Sometimes we do things against our will
I know I cry lonely tears
When love is gone away
When I know all the love is gone
From the pain of loving you
All I know is that I love you still
Sometimes we do things against our will
I know I cry lonely tears
Imagine the Backstreet Boys
Thousand spoke on the go to Impala
Love how I cruised my hustle
Let me tell you the story
About the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out
When I was about to go home
And there she was standing in front of me
Someone's waiting for me
But I'm gonna go up and see
I'll say again you're dropping out my battery is low
I can't take it back what's done is done
One of her friends found out
That she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside
That she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied
I'll say again you're dropping out my battery is low
Don't stay up and wait
I feel for ya if you can relate
I take it aways like two days stays
Let me tell you the story
About the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out
When I was about to go home
And there she was standing in front of me
I'll say again you're dropping out my battery is low
We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
But I called my girl up and said
Just wanna tell you don't worry
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
Just because I made that call and lied
Just wanna tell you don't worry
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
Just wanna tell you don't worry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
My feet on the ground but I can't run
Drowning the noise inside my head
It's killing me to see myself
How do you learn how to forgive
Deep down inside you can't forget
With all that I regret
I pray for the first time in a long time
Finally I'm waking up
I feel like I can let you go
Say everything I wanted to say
I'm okay with being alone
I never was sure but now I am
This was the choice I had to make
Maybe I'll never understand
Sometimes you gotta make mistakes
Finally I'm waking up
I feel like I can let you go
Say everything I wanted to say
I'm okay with being alone
Finally I face it off
I feel like I can let it show
I know I can walk away
I'm okay with being alone
I see for the first time in a long time
Finally I'm waking up
I feel like I can let you go
Say everything I wanted to say
I'm okay with being alone
Finally I face it off
I feel like I can let it show
I know I can walk away
I'm okay with being alone
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor
I wanna let you walk away tonight
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
Baby I don't want to waste another day
Keeping it inside is killing me
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I memorized the number
Keeping it inside is killing me
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I don't wanna be like this
I just wanna let you know
Everything that I hold in
Is everything I can't let go
Keeping it inside is killing me
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
Don't you know it baby
I don't wanna waste another day
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
My name is Kev and I like the
Type of girl who can love me for me
A type of girl who I can hold in my
Arms and give her all that I have to give
And if you're that type of girl
I like a serious girl
Somebody who's gonna be smart
A girl who even likes to even go to school
I like a girl who's got a good head on her shoulder
All my love is for you
I'm gonna give it to you
I like the type of girl that one day she'll become my wife
We'll get married and she'll make me breakfast
She'll make me lunch and my dinner
Who'll let me do everything for her
Let me make you dinner baby
All my love is for you
I'm gonna give it to you
The type of girl that likes to move her body
The type of girl that likes to shake what her mama gave her
The type of girl that lets me hold her hand and then kiss her
The type to let me take her to the movies and then kiss her
The type to let me hold her so tight and then kiss her
All my love is for you
I'm gonna give it to you
And I'm gonna always love you
And I'm gonna always love you
And I will always love you
And I just want you to know that I will always love you
Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you
I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
I don't know but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Praying for the day that you'll be mine
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give to you
All the money in the world
Could never add up to all the love
And I will give it to you
Everything I have is for you
All that I have to give to you
My love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give to you
Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you
But love is all I have to give to you
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
Understand girl that my heart is in your hands
Please don't hurt me...
I'm afraid of being a fool again
Baby I'm yours if you want me
Baby I'm yours if you need me
Baby I'm yours if you need me
Realize girl that my faith is kind of torn
So watch your step girl
Because my heart is weak and worn
So won't you please be careful I'm fragile
I can't imagine the damage
If you hurt me one more time
Baby I'm yours if you want me
Baby I'm yours if you need me
Baby I'm yours if you need me
Hey baby I finally found someone
I just want you to know
That I'm your sweetheart...
Hey someone that you can depend on...
Baby I'm yours if you want me
Baby I'm yours if you need me
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
But I called my girl up and said
Listen baby I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I say again you're dropping out my battery is low
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied
Listen baby I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I say again you're dropping out my battery is low
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing there in front of me
Listen baby I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I say again you're dropping out my battery is low
Listen baby I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I say again you're dropping out my battery is low
Ooh ooh oh ooh ooh oh oh
There are so many things
That we promised each other
But since you went away
My heart has been in so much pain
It seems that everything we've been through
And I wouldn't if I could
But I can't keep waking up
And you should have known
When you told me you loved me
That you were deceiving
I have faith that the hurt that I feel
Deep inside will soon be leaving
But now I'm all alone
To hold you in my arms once again
And I wouldn't if I could
But I can't keep waking up
I saw you pull to the back
And roll with the cream in the back
Like you wanna get funky
Feel you out to see how you think
I love the way you move
Can't wait to get you on the floor cause
You got that body baby
I came to ask you for this dance
Baby let's dance girl
Can't let you leave until we dance girl
Cause there'll be fire when we dance
Hold up it's not about sex
It's all about the vibe and the mix
Let me see rolling hips
Let me sneak a kiss on the lips
I love the way you move
Can't wait to get you on the floor cause
You got that body baby
I came to ask you for this dance girl
Can't let you leave until we dance girl
Cause there'll be fire when we dance

Ain't no harm in moving your body here in the party

We're gonna be turning this out tonight
Baby let's dance girl
Can't let you leave until we dance
Can't let you leave until we dance
Cause there'll be fire when we dance dance dance dance
There'll be fire baby
There is something special
About this time of year
The Christmas feeling's everywhere
I've been away too long
But now I'm back to share my love
Filled with love to last
Time to share our love
The tidings to the world
The best time of the year
A sleigh ride in the park
A loving kiss straight from my heart
Straight from the heart
Snowflakes are falling gently
The smell of chestnuts in the air
And Christmas lights they gleam
Everything felt so right
When I held you close to me
Those cold Christmas nights
When we sewed the world in harmony
Time to share our love
The tidings to the world
Feeding off the clouds and eating Them like ice cream
Oh I'm not even finished
Wind in my face it hardly ever Rains
I'm everything and I am everything
I know it all don't know a thing
I'm every color I'm every color
I've been on the side
I'm so very fast give me a Speeding ticket
No I'm not even finished
Wind in my face it hardly ever Rains
I'm everything and I am everything
I know it all don't know a thing
I'm every color I'm every color
The truth is stranger than fiction
When you're a walking contradiction
When you're evergreen
You're always looking in
You're the first one left
But you're back again
Don't be afraid to ask
We'll forever last when you're Evergreen
Wind in my face it hardly ever Rains
I'm everything and I am everything
I know it all don't know a thing
You were so good at that
Too many pieces to put back
You were the best by far
How did we end up like this
I even know who you are
I can't believe it's like this
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
Your wings are lying on the ground
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
Forever is a long way down
You were everything that I thought I wanted to be
But everything has disappeared for me
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
Destroy the life you built for us
Was I the last to tell
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
Your wings are lying on the ground
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
Forever is a long way down
You were everything that I thought I wanted to be
But everything has disappeared for me
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
The only thing that's worse than emptiness
Is when your heart's lost
And the only thing that's worth the pain
Is the price of what love costs
That's when it's gone
Believe me you're so wrong
Tell me how does it feel
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
Your wings are lying on the ground
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
Forever is a long way down
You were everything that I thought I wanted to be
But everything has disappeared for me
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
I wanna know how it feels
I saw you and later I Loved you
That is higher love in the sky
That is higher love in the sky
And when I see you again
That is higher love in the sky
And when I see you again
Last night on the road with my head spinning
... Ahead for a dead end but I turned it around
Never thought for once that it will end up like this before
Always thought I will be the one driving
Attention and conscious size I am ... the dropping line
Completely out of control
Just when I ran into you
Girl you turned my life around
Where would I be without you
Last night on the road with my head spinning
... Ahead for a dead end but I turned it around
I drove some ... and nothing was there
I swear this pain is killing me
I know it's eating all of me
I had a ... and I am on the back street
Just to realize the world don't revolves around me
I was ... how could you ever loved a ...
Last night on the road with my head spinning
... Ahead for a dead end but I turned it around
I know that everything is true
The only ... I had to turn around
I wanna know you name but there's something
That is keeping me away from you
I wanna take you away and there's nothing
I wouldn't give to be with you
I wanna know you name but there's something
That is keeping me away from you
I wanna take you away and there's nothing
I wanna know you name but there's something
I wanna take you away and there's nothing
I need sometime to find myself in me
And I need sometime to find true love
But if I can't then I won't stop trying
If I don't then I won't live lying
They wanna be happy...
Love to love the way that you love me
Please don't change and subject me to such pain
Love to love the way that you love me
You had me when you said hello
Love to love the way that you love me
Love to love the way that you love me
Over a triple X movie screen
I couldn't care less about being seen
I say baby do you think
Sugar so sweet should rot my teeth
But instead it just rottens me
Public display of affection
Pointing in that direction
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
Remember at the beach we brought the sheets
We were harassed by police
Good thing we didn't go too deep
Everywhere we be the passion in me just screams
I just need you in my reach
Baby your suspense can be intense
You're the fingers to my instrument
Public display of affection
Pointing in that direction
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
From the lobby to the patio
And we're so compatible
And we're so compatible
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
Public display of affection
Stay here don't put out the glow
Hold me now don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man
I was trying to be someone
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Touch me now don't bother
If every second it makes me weaker
I was trying to be someone
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart
I never wanna play the same old part
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
I was trying to be someone
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
I was trying to be someone
Now let me show you the shape of
I'm trying to pick up
The pieces of my life
I forgot that we were over
Tell me what went wrong
I'm stuck and you know you've got me in it
Broken glass on the floor from the picture frame
If you could read my mind
You'd know I've crossed that line
You know that I mean it
I need you next to me
There's nowhere to run
Girl I can't let you go
And it's twisted I know
But I just can't take it no more
I'm on my way just like I have so many times before
If you could read my mind
I'm gonna fight to get you back this time
You know that I mean it
I need you next to me
There's nowhere to run
Girl I can't let you go
And it's twisted I know
But I just can't take it no more
I'm tired of all these lies
There's nothing but regret behind these eyes
All this love I could never show
I don't care any more
Give a damn who knows
You know that I mean it
I need you back with me
There's nowhere to run
Girl I can't let you go
And it's twisting my soul
But I just can't take it no more
You know that I mean it
I need you next to me
And it's twisted I know
But I just can't take it no more
Tired of all the lies
Oh babe you've got me stripped of my pride
Gonna shout it from a mountain top
Gonna break down these walls
There's me looking down at my shoes
The one smiling like the sun that's you
There's us going on about a band
Working out how we'd play our hands
I lay there dreaming later on alone in my bed
If I was stupid maybe careless so were you
Not everything is supposed to come true
Some words are best unsaid some love is not really love at all
I'll keep everything I shared with you
And that's enough there's us
Freeze frame I'm not about to cry
Its to late for us to change why try
I got a camera tucked away inside my heart
If I'm a loser or just unlucky so are you
Not everything is supposed to come true
Some words are best unsaid some love is not really love at all
I'll keep everything I shared with you
And that's enough there's us
Somewhere between then and now
I looked away when you said we'll never change
And if you think we might have been
You'll lose today and we've got songs to play
Not everything is supposed to come true
Some words are best unsaid some love is not really love at all
I'll keep everything I shared with you
And that's enough there's us
Not everything is supposed to come true
Some words are best unsaid some love is not really love at all
I'll keep everything I shared with you
And that's enough there's us
I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
That's what you always say to me
Oh what I'm trying to say to you
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
Did you hear me I said hey girl
Don't try to play me for a fool
I could never be your fool
Gonna find someone who really wants me
When you know we'll never be
Keep thinking that were gonna be
When you know we'll never be
Keep thinking that were gonna be
I thought it was love
That you came from above
You have made what I am
She's all I hope to be
Fulfilling all my dreams
She is my dream come true
Cause you are everything
My heart could ever imagine
And fly all over the sky
And fly without stopping
And fly all over the sky
And fly without stopping
You're the reason why I found my way
And you're the reason why I feel this way
And you're the reason why I have to sing
I had to let you know you're my everything
So many times I've been alone
I didn't know what to do
I don't know where I'd be
Give me the strength I need
Since you came into my life it's been so heavenly
You're the reason why I found my way
And you're the reason why I feel this way
And you're the reason why I have to sing
I had to let you know you're my everything
So many things I want to say to you
I'd give my all to you just because
You came around and gave me
Now I'd sacrifice my very life
All you have to do is say the word
And there would never be no other
You're the reason why I found my way
And you're the reason why I feel this way
And you're the reason why I have to sing
I had to let you know you're my everything
You're the reason why I found my way
And you're the reason why I feel this way
And you're the reason why I have to sing
I had to let you know you're my everything
You're the reason why I have a sing
Fell that boom bang beat shining down on are dancing feet
See that star in the sky
We've got a doggone beat now
We gonna call our very own
Nassau rock and Nassau roll
And we've got a doggone beat now
We gonna take care of business too
You know my heart is still in the Caribbean
I still hear my girlfriend say
And the sailing boats beneath the bridge so high
I feel the sun and my heart within me leaving
I hear cowbells and the drums on New Years morning
And I smell hibiscus in the tropic skies above
I know it's Nassau and everything about it I love
But your heart is in the Caribbean
You can hear them say
To the land of the sun and the palmy beaches
Where your heart belongs
Cannot get it in America
At the Medical Center what you think
The doctor said you'll have to drink.
And go back to the West Indies.
Cannot get it in America
I want to do the thing that I shouldn't
But when I tried I found that I couldn't
Many nights I sit here
With memories by the score
Thinking of the days I've spent
With the girl I still adore
So I'm going back to see her
Before all my days are done
Going back to see her
In the land of the sea and sun
About this Nassau girl
Put my thoughts in motion
And found my heart in a whirl
So I'm going back to see her
Before my days are gone
Going back to see her
In the land of the sea and sun
Ever since I've left her
Nothing has been the same
I think I'll pull up anchor
I'm going back to give her my name
Oh so many nights I sit here
With memories by the score
Thinking of the days I've spent
With the girl I still adore
Yes I'm going back to see her
Before my days are done
Going back to see her
We get it almost every night
And when that moon gets big and bright
It's a super natural delight
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
They don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose
They keep things right
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
Dancing in the moonlight
Feeling warm and right
It's such a warm and natural sight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight
We like our fun and never fight
We can dance and stay on top
It's a super natural delight
Dancing in the moonlight
Everybody's feeling warm and right
It's such a warm and natural sight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight
They don't don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose
They keep things right
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
Dancing in the moonlight
Feeling warm and right
It's such a warm and natural sight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight
We get it almost every night
And when that moon gets big and bright
It's a super natural delight
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
They don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose
They keep things right
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
Dancing in the moonlight
Feeling warm and right
It's such a warm and natural sight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight
We like our fun and never fight
We can dance and stay on top
It's a super natural delight
Dancing in the moonlight
Everybody's feeling warm and right
It's such a warm and natural sight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight
They don't don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose
They keep things right
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
Dancing in the moonlight
Feeling warm and right
It's such a warm and natural sight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight
I fell in love with you
Was such a special night
You lay right by my side
And I told you things I never told a soul
And now that I have you babe
I promise I'll never leave
I don't know what to do
A love that never ends
You're more than just a friend
And my heart and soul I'll always give to you
Someday you'll be my wife
And I'll be with you until the end of time
I promise I'll never leave
I don't know what to do
It doesn't matter what you say or do
Let's me know you're crazy over me
And I'm crazy over you
That you'll come back to me
You gonna run away and hide
I'm gonna run right by your side
For you pretty baby I'll even die
That you'll come back to me
That you'll come back to me
You're gonna sit right down and cry
All you gonna do is dry your eye
Go Back to the Island Boy
Going back to the island
I say don't worry mama don't cry
I sure hope that she's still able
Sow the seed around 5 o'clock
I'll stand at her bow and see the dark
Out in the field from dawn till dusk
Swimming in the blue hole is a must
That island where I was born
First thing I'll do is grow some corn
Going back to the island
I say don't worry mama don't cry
I've been Cooking outside in the island pot
So young when I learn I haven't forgotten
Saturday night we gonna dance and sway
People don't you understand
Live like a king and be a happy man
Going back to the island
I say don't worry mama don't cry
Going back to the island
I say don't worry mama don't cry
I got to go back to the island
I got to go back to the island
I got to go back to the island
Going back to the island
I say don't worry mama don't cry
That's the way I like it
That's the way I like it
When you give me all your love
And do it the very best you can
Your way to beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal suicidal when you say it's over
Dam all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal
When they say it's over
You get two for the price of one
It took me a long time to find a good woman
One that would be true
That's why I'm gonna double
What it takes baby to hold on to you
As good as it was before
I'm gonna love you so good
You'll be begging and crying for more
And you're gonna receive double pleasure every time I do
You feel so good inside
You're gonna be satisfied
I've been dying to use on you
Don't be afraid to give me your love
You make the first step baby
And the rest I can easily do
You get two for the price of one
That's where you wanna go
To get away from it all
Tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
And we'll perfect our chemistry
That dreamy look in your eye
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
Now if you wanna go and get away from it all
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
I see the dance people had a ball
Get back you flea infested mongrel
You put a woman in front and her man behind
I heard a woman shout out
I see the dance people had a ball
Get back you flea infested mongrel
If you want some take some go out and get it
Gotta show her you the mac of the game or just forget it
I was up with the moon
And down with the stars
Watch me go down there and do my talk
Tell me would it be okay if I say
Baby don't turn me away
And only she could light my fuse
Desperate men make desperate moves
Please please give me a chance of romance just for two
Till I opened my eyes and to my surprise

Hanging out at one beach or another
All the trees start to sway to the music
And the breeze starts caressing your hair.
Summer love makes my heart
Sing and jump in the air.
The days are getting longer
And the moon stays up all night.

If hope is in your eyes
When the times get tough
And you can't breathe free
And the friends you made don't return the calls
And pretend you don't exist
Everyday is a brand new start
You can take the prize
If hope is in your eyes
You'll be sure to catch the moon
All your dreams are possible
Everyday is a brand new start
You can take the prize
If hope is in your eyes
You'd never leave our happy home.
And everything was cool.
And maybe you can just tell me
And make you come back it me.
All the joy that you have brought to me
And make you come back to me.

For another cup of wine
In your arms so tight

Well I'm just a normal guy in a normal world
I live a normal life. I got a normal girl
I drive to normal places in my normal car
I even wish upon the normal stars
But people say it isn't normal
If I want to pierce my nose
Or if I let a blind man design my clothes
Or if I pick the petals leave the thorns upon my rose
Or if I just want to paint my toes
My friends say it isn't normal if I don't want to touch that stuff
And if you don't like it that's tough.
Once upon a time there was a man who had a wife
And I want to be an actor and a sculptor
Maybe I wanna drive a tractor
So what if you don't like to dance to my beat
So what if you're expensive and you think I'm cheap
So what if I don't want to come my hair
And I bet you he thinks I'm normal
Every individual has their own skill
We all set goals that we want to fulfill
It's your life so do what you wanna do
And that's gonna make you normal
I want to do what I do
I want to do what I do Everybody's normal
Heaven has already granted me my wish
Still I never thought it would be as pleasant as this
Though you have no wings like the angels up above
You have a heavenly smile and also the gift of love
I promise to love you in everything I do
And know that you love me to
For sending you here to fill my loneliness
And to fill my lonely heart with love
And I am going to get down on my knees everyday
For what he sent to me today
I promise to love you in everything I do
And know that you love me to
For sending you here to fill my loneliness
And to fill my lonely heart with love
Said I am going to get down on my knees
I am going to thank him for what he sent to me
When you look in my eyes
My heart skips a beat there
I look into your eyes
Best years of our lives
I could hardly believe
The things that would happen
So let's stay together
Oh girl I'm so thankful
That you are still mine
I look into your eyes
Best years of our lives
My world's a better place
I'll be right by your side
I look into your eyes
Best years of our lives
I helped you keep my shine on
A perky little something
Let's just rewind the song
The rest years the best years
I look into your eyes
Best years of our lives
I look into your eyes
It doesn't matter where we go as long as I'm with you
Loving and holding you close
Let's fly away to paradise
I'll help you understand oh
You know a holiday is coming we can break away
And if it's you and me together we can save the day
You know a holiday is coming we can break away
And if it's you and me together we can save the day
Our tomorrows and our yesterdays are passing by
And you know the time has finally come
For us to get away from everything that brings us down
See baby it's time to have some fun
I'll help you understand oh
You know a holiday is coming we can break away
And if it's you and me together we can save the day
You know a holiday is coming we can break away

And if it's you and me together we can save the day
You know a holiday is coming we can break away
And if it's you and me together we can save the day
You know a holiday is coming we can break away
And if it's you and me together we can save the day
I said I'm rich in love
Financially I'm a pauper
I'm not the man for you if it's money you're after
I'm not the man for you if it's money you're after
The best that I can buy for you is something cool to drink

But right now it's pure echo in your pockets
Girl if it's money you are after please stop it
You see I'm out of your league so just drop it.
I know my loving can't bring you riches on the stock market
You're loving can't even fill up my grocery basket
And I'm sure that your loving can't pay my rent
But my loving is free girl it don't cost a cent
He wants me for his queen
He's built a throne for me

I remember when I was young
Me and dad had so much fun
Climbing trees and skipping stones
I had a couple of lizards
But the biggest kick I've ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were playing on the dock
And how your feet just can't keep still
I'm always catching them every time
And I guess I always will
Plan on rocking was the way to put things right
Me and Terri by my side
Taking salties for a ride
Up the river to be safe and sound
That he won't be found
That's the way my dad taught me
And how your feet just can't keep still
I'm always catching them every time
And I guess I always will
Ruff to my left Ruff to my right
You snacks shag in the house
Light on my paws some jaws
If you want some take some go out and get it
Gotta show her you the mac of the game or just forget it
I was up with the moon
And down with the stars
Watch me go down there and do my talk
Tell me would it be okay if I say
Baby don't turn me away
And only she could light my fuse
Desperate men make desperate moves
Please please give me a chance of romance just for two
Till I opened my eyes and to my surprise
But you gotta give all you got to get me
If not yo I got other guys that wanna see me
Hun let me show you how its done
You gotta have balls or you ain't gonna get none
Whose favorite book has all the animals you can wish
Welcome to Stanley's world
Come help him figure out
What life is all about
No problem Stan can't solve
With a friend like you
With a friend like you
Coach said to fake right
Watch out for the pick
Gotta run the give and go
And take the ball to the hole
To shoot the outside J
Just keep ya head in the game
Just keep ya head in the game
To shoot the outside J
Just keep ya head in the game
That we get the rebound
Then the crowd will go wild
We'll hit the right notes
It's not the time or place
Get my head in the game
Get my head in the game
Why am I feeling so wrong
My head's in the game
But my heart's in the song
She makes this feel so right
Well I wake up in the morning each and every day
And I sit down at the table and I hear my daddy say
Life is nothing but a slap in the face
Life is nothing but a fat rat race
Every night I have a dream that you're taking off your dress
The only thing you're wearing is a button on your chest
Life is nothing but a slap in the face
Life is nothing but a fat rat race
It's a jungle out there and I know I don't belong
So all night long I just sing my stupid song
Life is nothing but a slap in the face
Life is nothing but a fat rat race
Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do
Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do
Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do
When your down and out
When the road you walk
And the tears you cry
Start to sink too much
Gotta set your sights
Everyday is a brand new start
You can take the prize
If hope is in your eyes
When the times get tough
And you can't breathe free
And the friends you made don't return the calls
And pretend you don't exist
Everyday is a brand new start
You can take the prize
If hope is in your eyes
You'll be sure to catch the moon
All your dreams are possible
Everyday is a brand new start
You can take the prize
If hope is in your eyes
Hey ho what's good with you now
Rock the house get you up on your feet
Get away from the rat race
We're gonna raise the roof
Let the music do it's thing to you
Drop the top and dance all night
Life is good so let me
What's good with you now
You know what to do now
Roll your booty round from left to right
The way you take a go
Now baby work it girl
That's exactly how we do
Life is good so let me
You know what to do now
Come go with me and let your
You don't have to bring a dollar
Come and do your thing
I'm gonna make your body sing
If you want to jump and dance
I'm gonna make your body prance
What's good with you now
You know what to do now
What's good with you now
You know what to do now
Want to make you bounce
Hitting all the spots while the sun still shining
Give me some of your time girls
You keep the party going on all over the world
And I keep missing out
And the sun keeps shining
Till the break of dawn
Now the groove is on and the sun keeps shining
Give me some of your time girls
You keep the party going on all over the world
And I keep missing out
Give me some of your time girls
You keep the party going on all over the world
And I keep missing out
Call it dirty love on the street life
Ain't no worries girl
It's the summertime...
Give me some of your time girls
You keep the party going on all over the world
And I keep missing out
Give me some of your time girls
You keep the party going on all over the world
And I keep missing out
Take me with ya my girls
Give me some of your time girls
You keep the party going on all over the world
And I keep missing out
When I was a cool young one
Accepting without question the prevailing views
That a young man's life was one long grind
What a wonderful phrase
Ain't no passing craze
For the rest of your days
It's our problem free
When I was a shallow youth
Cool calm reflection I was never that good
I was a pawn in the game I saw no trees for the wood
My future stretched behind me I was over the hill
I put my best foot forward while the other one stood still
For the rest of your days
It's our problem free
I hoped we have conveyed
It's much cooler in the shade
Some say it's just a waste of time
But they don't realize
That the view is nothing but a crime
We're all creatures world wise
It's our problem free
Ain't no passing craze
For the rest of your days
It's our problem free
Ain't no passing craze
It's a world of hope and a world of fears.
That it's time we're aware
It's a small world after all.
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
And a smile means friendship to everyone.
Though the mountains be wide.
And the oceans are wide.
It's a small world after all.
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
No matter if you're big or small
It's a world of hope and a world of fears
There's so much that we share
That it's time we're aware
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
All you boys and girls sing along
There's no place I'd rather be
Than on my jet ski out at sea
Lingering in the ocean blue
And if I had one wish come true
I'd surf till the sunset
Everyone come ride the wave now
Everyone come ride the wave now
There's no place I'd rather be
Than on the seashore right we're free
The golden sand is where I live
And if I only had my way
I'd play till the sunset beyond the horizon
Catch a crew. come ride the wave now
Everyone come ride the wave now
Time to try the Bahamas roller coaster ride
Now everybody now ride the wave
Everybody say wipe out
There's no place id rather be
Than on my jet ski out at sea
Lingering in the ocean blue
And if I had one wish come true
I'd surf till the sunset beyond the horizon
Catch a crew come rid the wave now
Everyone come ride the wave now
You know that's how we do
Get away from the rat race
Let the music do it's thing to you
Play ahead and get it started
Come on now take you for a ride
Drop the top and dance all night
Life is good so let me hear you holler
That's exactly how we do
Bringing the party to you
Life is good so let me hear you holler
Ride your groove and let it out
Let me hear you holler
You don't have to bring a dollar
Come on up and do your thing
If you want to jump and dance
I was at home playing DJ
Jumped on the beat and flew away
Our party was moving out of control
I move to a rhythm I don't know
Make that woman dance
Make that woman dance
She makes me forget what world I'm on
Make that woman dance
Make that woman dance
And I see you on the dance floor and you tell me
Why don't you come and stomp your feet along with me
Make that woman dance
And we gonna kick it like this
Lets move it all night
Gonna take you back to the old school
Lets dance to the rhythm
And let me see your wide waist line
And the electric slide
Doing the running man
Or walk the feeling out if you can
Everybody rocks to the beat
And everybody runs together
I didn't know what to say
So I would ask my mother
To go outside and play
I thought she didn't love me
So I got me stuff and fled
Now I wonder if it was the right thing to do
Since I have fallen and hit my head
And now that I'm away from home
When I was young I wanted to be famous
I think that this is all a sham
For whatever they want you to believe
So believe everything stars say
They are just influencing you to do what they think is right
Witch really isn't right to begin with
So I am going to tell you
Not to believe everything happiness says
Nothing feels better then running from fears
I thought she didn't love me
So I got me stuff and fled
Now I wonder if it was the right thing to do
Since I have fallen and hit my head
And now that I'm away from home
So now that I have told you what I think
I hope that you take it to heart
My mother never answered or talked to me much
So then I started to get this big hunch
That she didn't want me near her
Even though she said I was dear to her
And the stars tell you to live your own life
And be who you want to be
But nothing really turns out the way you want it
Unless you believe in yourself
I thought she didn't love me
So I got me stuff and fled
Now I wonder if it was the right thing to do
Since I have fallen and hit my head
And now that I'm away from home
I thought she didn't love me
So I got me stuff and fled
Now I wonder if it was the right thing to do
Since I have fallen and hit my head
And now that I'm away from home
I thought she didn't love me
So I got me stuff and fled
Now I wonder if it was the right thing to do
Since I have fallen and hit my head
And now that I'm away from home
They make me ill I know I feel you
That's why we got to stick together
Got me lit like a candlestick Get too hot when you touch the tip
You got me going again Baby you got me going again You make sick
We was on our way home on the freeway
He told me that he wanna go home With me up on the hill to my condo
But I told him go I don't really know though
He got closer to me He started getting deep
He had me in a zone When he started to show me things
I never saw before Baby was smooth but I knew it was game
Helluva a cool but you man had the same The way he licked his lips
And touched my hips I knew that he was slick
Got me lit like a candlestick Get too hot when you touch the tip
You got me going again Baby you got me going again You make sick
He told me you would make it worth it
But thinking how many times have I heard this
Got him feeling but I'm not even nervous
All his slick ass lines were kind of working
I felt my knees get weak But he was calling me
Just couldn't take the heat Anyway it was two or three
I had to get out the streets Baby was cool but I knew it was game
He was too smooth to be screaming my name
And even though we made the best of it I still told him this
Got me lit like a candlestick Get too hot when you touch the tip
You got me going again Baby you got me going again You make sick
Got me lit like a candlestick Get too hot when you touch the tip
You got me going again Baby you got me going again You make sick
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip
Driving me crazy baby don't you quit
You got me going again
Baby you got me going again
I want you and I hate it
Hot when you touch the tip
I gotta get a grip of this
Driving me crazy baby don't you quit
I can't do it on my own
You end up breaking your back bone
I must have been dreaming
But in the morning I woke up
And the whole thing was in my head
For all the better lonely loves
And let this get out of hand
For me or for your boyfriend's band
But you still get me high
Make love to you all night
For all the better lonely loves
Though there were men before me
That held you in their arms
With a love so hot and getting hotter
They're setting off fire alarms
Though their were girls before you
I remember their names
Though you might have a plan
Those plans are all in the past
Who among us could know
That our love would come and grow so very fast
Seems like we got in your car
And drove that car to the beach
You know I'm thanking the lord for blessing you with hockey teeth
Every morning when we wake up and our lips meet
It's like a southern drawl
And it don't seem worth your time
If the two of us ain't one of a kind.
I won't be another turn
To gather up and use what you learn.
And of course he's always on your mind
You should hold him dear
Leave his love behind
I won't be another turn
To gather up and use what you learn
I know that it could take some time
Into the corner you've been living in
But your love can't be my only thrill
It comes and goes and then comes back awhile
You are bored and I am old
And there's something that's just not there
Neither one of us could care less or even love more
He lays down beside her
Darling please forgive me
For loving that will learn to show
All my other friends have gone
He lays down beside her
Now you're sleeping alone
And I hear wedding bells
I've been true all these years
You've been messing around
Now you're going to hear the sound of my heart breaking
He lays down beside her
His wife stays home and cries
This is going to be the reason that their love dies
Sunset sings the sweetest tune
Just the song he wrote for his true love in bloom
I held you dear since the dawn of time
You know it's true that for you I shine
I'm only hoping some day you'll turn around
How I wish you felt the same
I'm jealous of the wolves when they howl out your name
I send my love bouncing from star to star
So it can find you wherever you are
I'm only hoping some day you'll turn around
Ah who could love you more than me
Is it really that much sweeter
There's no need to convert a believer
Well I ain't that special someone
You should spend a night with a fun one
Someone who mates to become one
Well I always said don't mind me
But your love always seems to find me
It's always creeping up behind me
After being with him you'd want someone like me
You could have all the time in the world
If you'd only be mine
But I know you don't love me
When you remember me darling I hope it makes you smile
I love driving you crazy if only just for a while
But I know you don't love me
Yeah I know you don't love me
You could talk all night or when I see your tattoo
I know you don't love me
We both knew it then and we both could tell
I know you don't love me
In the deep dark corners of some dirty bar
The people find something that they're looking for
I can't be bothered to look that far
I got so much behind my own door
I got books and records and crossword puzzles and movies made for TV
I'm living now but I ain't loving yet and I need someone to share it all
Let the good times roll
I may not feel old inside
They don't feel that way and I still do what I can
A rough start but we can make it last
Some say I'm always set in my ways
That I ain't ever going to change
I don't mind that I don't change these days
Right now I just need something
You could be that one thing
I'll be yours till the morning
Then leave without warning
I'll can't wait forever
You had your chance already
There's only one girl in the world for you
And she's probably in Tahiti
Or Maybe she's in the Bahamas
Where the Caribbean Sea is blue
We've been in a tropical moonlight night
To find out where they hide her
Why am I hanging around in the rain out here
Trying to pick up a girl
Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears
When there's girls all over the world
Is she lying on a tropical beach somewhere
Underneath the tropical sun
Pining away in a heat wave there
Hoping that I won't be long
I should be lying on that sun soaked beach with her
Caressing her warm brown skin
Then in a year or maybe not quite
We'll be sharing the same next of kin
To find out where they hide her
I'm lost in the light
Don't know what we should do
So if someone could see me now
When we just stood still
You let me hold your hand till I had my fill
I just toss and turn right there beside ya
So if someone could help me now
All the hard things we've all gotta do
So you wouldn't be wrong
Still I rattled your bones
I said some awful things and I take them back
If we would try again
Before we were lovers I swear we were friends
So if someone could see me now
All the hard things we've all gotta do
So you wouldn't be wrong
I would wonder what would make her stay
You were left thinking
As if my drinking was the only thing that drove her away
Or alone for just one night.
You'd hit the ceiling
I couldn't shake it if I tried
I see it in your eyes
You don't give a damn
Don't give up your man
Of stealing days from me and you
Don't seem like no plan
Don't give up on your man
Of all the things we said
Which words will I hold true
If I could stay the course
My voice how it's horse
Now here we are again
Both wishing now was then
I can tell when you lie
The wink of a mannequins eye
Some say it's written inside
Everybody learns how to lie
I know we had it before
Where in the world did it go
I'm happy here on my own
And that's fine with you
You were never steady or slow
Every time George sings here comes the sun
Every time I feel like it's all been done
I wonder where are you now
Happier than when you were mine
I know it don't seem like much
A piece of me is your piece of mind
Every time Sam sings a change gonna come
Every time I feel like it's all been done
If this were not up to me.
All that you'll let me do.
You turned around on me.
For something you found in me.
If laughter's all we had
There's joy in feeling sad
To fight ya over this
Is to taste my lover's kiss
All the times to you I lied
Of all the hurt I hold inside
You help me get it off my chest
You hold the pain and leave the rest
My voice cut through the crowd
As if I was anybody that might have something to say
Standing tall I seemed to know it all
But the only thing I know is that I've never known someone like you
I'm gonna figure out how it is
Of all the things we did
And all the things we could have done
Looking back would you
For all the times I left you when I should have stayed right by your side
I'm gonna figure out how it is
I love you baby and I want to know
If the little baby that's inside of you grows
Months will pass by and when you start to show
That's when I'll be jumping for joy
Oh that's when I'll be jumping for joy
I'm so happy that you're ming all mine
I'll get your loving in the evening time
I know you think it's trouble
And I hate to burst your bubble now
I love you baby and I've just gotta say
If the little baby that's inside of you stays
Years will pass by and when we're both old and gray
That's when I'll be jumping for joy
Oh that's when I'll be jumping for joy
Oh that's when I'll be jumping
Fist in the air pumping for joy
Here I am back again.
And wishing now was then.
And I could write all the wrongs instead of writing songs.
It's you I think of now
And how I push it like a snow plow
You come racing through my mind
You gave me love so pure
But no loves for sure
Tell me what to say to make it go away and Ill do that
Tell me what to do to make it up to you and I'll do that too
Time means so much if all I have is your sweet touch
Do I hold you back in all the ways I lack what ya need dear
And headed toward the end you were looking for a friend and that ain't me
Time means so much if all I have is your sweet touch
Time and time again my love I wonder where you are
Time and time again my love I've found you among the stars
Time and time again my love I felt from you so far
Time and time again my love seen your face in each passing car
Now I admit I might let my mind wander
But it only gets as far as my heart
Time and time again my love I left you feeling blue
Time and time again my love you looked around for someone new
Time and time again my love well I guess I look around too
Time and time again our love brings me right back around to you
Now I admit I might let my mind wander
But it only gets as far as my heart
Now I admit a few heavy days go by
And I can't remember when
We ever disagreed though I know
I couldn't even give you half of what you wanted if I wanted to.
But it won't shock me baby if you say you feel the same.
I couldn't even give you half of what you wanted if I wanted to.
And I held the breath inside my lungs for days
And I saw myself as one of many waves
And when I knew I'd become the ocean's slave
And we carried far with all the waters past
Of the waves I was not first I was not last
And if we saw a boat afloat we took the mast
And before too long the waves grew out of hand
And they worked to keep the sea at their command
And the only thing they feared it seemed the sand
Oh there's a part of it
From the water there was born a bright blue roar
As it rolled and formed and calmed the ocean's floor
And it finally rose and broke upon the shore
Oh there's a part of it
I can't take you with me where I'm going
So now I leave behind all that once was mine
I can't take you with me where I'm going
I can't take you with me that's for certain
Anchored to some heavy red stage curtain
If I should hear you sing
Those words would just make me sting
I can't take you with me now I know it
Though the love was in me I did not show it
I found in Berlin who I swore might be my twin
Only does family flames
Whatever it is you been up to
And if they should ever say
Wouldn't trade all those bitter memories for her
And gives you every little thing he's got
One who can't be tamed
Still it's all the men before me they're the ones I blame
You can add my name to the long heavy chain around you
I got all the time in the world
I got all the time in the world
I have all the time in the world
You want it none of that
I have all the time in the world
You want it none of that
You want it none of that
With my world in front of my girl
There's something wrong with her
With my world in front of my girl
There's something wrong with her
How in the hell does one heart swell
To the size of beast with a bark like a big kick drum
Tell me what does it take to get a mouth that makes
Every old man around you to seem so young
But I know that you're stronger than that
And hitch a ride to the other side of the town
Still I know that you're stronger than that
Half of the times you were just half mine
For all that it's worth
You got both feet on the earth
You got body and mind
Where do they hide when you're by my side
Kind of gun to my head
Like some cruel kind of test
Now there is no one to blame
Closer than we'll ever see...
Thinking that if yours could just see mine
But we're blind to each other
Now there is no one in blame
Closer than we'll ever see
Be yourself I want no one else
By your side and still you hide
And shook me when you blew in
All winds someday change
Before they blow in cold and strange
But I might leave for the band.
That's nothing to you now.
That's nothing to you now.
That's nothing to you now.
Now that you have everything...
Gave herself to me completely.
Whole and half Japanese.
But you can't do all that you please.
That's nothing to you now.
That's nothing to you now.
That's nothing to you now.
Now that you have everything...
Always be who we are.
So from now on let's just spar.
Well you can find me at some bar.
That's nothing to me now.
That's nothing to me now.
That's nothing to me now.
Fell in love with someone on a jacket sleeve
And I counted the rings on her like a tree
She spun around forever 33
She's my little record girl
She's my little record girl
She's my little record girl
Whoa uh oh oh whoa whoa whoa
She's my little record girl
She was always begging for the needle down
It was the only way she could make a sound
Words were there jumping off of the page
And I thought the first time I'd see her up on stage
She's my little record girl
She's my little record girl
She's my little record girl
Whoa uh oh oh whoa whoa whoa
She's my little record girl
Now I'm thinking that it won't be long
Till I hear it all around the world
Finally found out she'd been moving around
There was one of her almost in town
Went to a friends I saw her there on a shelf
And I thought the whole time she was mine
I never had her to myself
She's my little record girl
She's my little record girl
She's my little record girl
Whoa uh oh oh whoa whoa whoa
She's my little record girl
She's my little record girl
She's my little record girl
And my breath held tight
Kept her out most nights
Wondering what about us was ever right
She saw all she could see
Wondering why she couldn't find me
And I'll measure time
Dropped it all and I ran
I burst through the door
And I'll measure time
In every breath there's life
Between my teeth a knife
Pronounced us man and wife
Cause once you've found your thrill
You move in for the kill
I'd chase you up the hill
Seems to be failing me
What once was fantasy
Is all I've ever known
The thing I miss the most
Lives in some demon host
I know you're not a ghost
If two could only hang
And it don't seem to matter much of what he says or what he does
As he tries in vain to show the kind of love he has to give
But we're not the same
She'll do all that she can
Trying hard to figure out what's already been done
And she's not suggesting someone else might be to blame
But we're not the same
So let the heart beat out its ancient tone
And let all those lovers seek to find
To open up their hearts and open their minds
And may one take the other's last name
Well I know it isn't me that the people came to see
Cause it wasn't long ago I wasn't offered a show
So now I try and say yes even if it's not the best
Well I can't be afraid of mistakes I've made
And that's the thanks you get
Sometimes I wake up and I think I had enough
Now the music is free and you can't blame me
There's no end in sight
If I open my mouth and nothing comes out
And just let her loose
Stay right here I'll be coming home soon
I just emptied my lungs to some empty room
So much to say but I just hold my tongue
I can do I can do no wrong
I'm stopping now because I'm due for a rest
And it kills you the worst by some blue ribbon best
There's no mystery no there's nothing at all
I can do I can do no wrong
No one really hurts me like you
No one hurts me quite like you do
Cut right through me with all that truth
No one hurts me quite like you do
I was the champion but I folded my hand
I got lonelier up there in that one man band
And now I'm falling for a friend of a friend
I see my whole life coming up around the bend
I can do I can do no wrong
Every last little thing
Not living it up while I'm away
But you never ever wanna let me live it down when I come home
Not giving it up now there's no way
But you gotta let me hang on to something honey
If you don't show me how you wanna be treated
Ah history just gets repeated
Not living it up while I'm away
But you never ever wanna let me live it down when I come home
Not giving it up now there's no way
Though I know that sometimes yes you'd rather be alone
If you don't show me how you wanna be treated
Ah history just gets repeated
And please just stay with me
With all that were given
We have all that we need
Is just some mouth to feed
Too only have one first kiss
Was it ever meant to be
Feels like committing a crime
There's no way I'm leaving
I'll stay by your side
I'm already breathing
Though you haven't died
One you'll never mean
Too only have one first kiss
Was it ever meant to be
I had a way with words for a while
You call it substance over style
Now I hear laugh but I don't see a smile
I had a way with words for a while
A dear old friend and a brand new sound
Don't keep it all so close to the vest
Our return will come some day
The three of us will laugh and play
I know that we can find a way
To put it all behind us
There'll be nothing to remind us
I won't protest but I won't be the same
For all the deadbeat dads
And the kids that they had
The ones that's left behind that's always up on their minds
To know that there's no excuse
To leave a boy in his youth
To never pick up the phone
And all the things I learned I guess I learned on my own
But what's done has been done
And now your only son
Wants to share the love with you he got from his mom
Bad boys need love too
I was still just a kid
Barely out of my crib
While my mother got paid
Always at someone's aid
Now her kids is full grown
They've got kids of their own
Put the past behind you mind you you're never alone
Cause my brothers they're two
Can't change who you are till you change what you do
Bad boys need love too
Every last thing of worth
To know that we share
The same water and air
So can't we be more mindful of what we put in there
When the oceans do rise
To tell yourself you'll be okay is to tell yourself lies
So let's change how we live
Less take and more give
It's in my mother's nature now to always forgive
Bad boys need love too
Left alone I just hurt myself
Take a bottle down from the shelf
And raise a toast to my own health
Was it really only me
Cause it takes two to disagree
So lets stay close and we'll both be free
I can't be everything to everyone
I can't be everything to everyone
I don't know why I always try to please everyone around me
I can't be everything to everyone
I don't do the things I should
I don't work as hard as I could
What're you doing to my neck of the woods
Cause now I'm waiting on you like a tax return
I can't be everything to everyone
I can't be everything to everyone
I don't know why I always try to please everyone around me
I can't be everything to everyone
I was wealthy and I didn't even know it
My whole life a magnum I'm on it
The only thing I'm in need of is a little tiny piece of your love
The only thing I'm in need of is a little tiny piece of your love
I had it all and lost my way
And no I can't find the words to say
I feel lucky that I'm even here today
I can't be everything to everyone
I can't be everything to everyone
I don't know why I always try to please everyone around me
I can't be everything to everyone
Everything to everyone
Everything to everyone
Everything to everyone
I feel it through my shoes
They used to call that the blues
Now they call it depression
Yes I get to feel so low
My wife don't want no part of me
And yes that fact is hard on me
I give the doctor a description
And he just writes a prescription
Peace and quiet were here before
But they both walked out the door
And left me with depression
I hardly leave my room
Most days I sleep till noon
Most folks think I'm fine
But the truth is I'm surprised
To all those girls I've loved before
I'm sorry I love this one more
If she would just stay with me
Her presence can only lift me
I start to come around
And stop putting myself down
I'm looking for any place
To drink too much and make mistakes
I'm looking for anyplace
I had the chance to make you mine
I had the chance and changed my mind
If I could just go back in time
I wouldn't go anyplace
Well I know how hard it can be
To live inside of memories
To hate the person that you see
When you see yourself
And to think that you have moved on
From all the love that's done you wrong
Comes back to you before too long
I'm looking for any place
To drink too much and make mistakes
I'm looking for anyplace
I had the chance to make you mine
I had the chance and changed my mind
If I could just go back in time
I wouldn't go anyplace
Well you lead me here by the hand
With the promise of a promised land
Now my master has no master plan
To see us all through
As they say the show must go on
Can't keep my public waiting long
Can't live my life inside a song
Cause every song ends
I'm looking for any place
To drink too much and make mistakes
I'm looking for anyplace
I had the chance to make you mine
I had the chance and changed my mind
If I could just go back in time
You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
When I met you. I picked you out
And turned you around
Turned you into someone new.
Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet
Success has been so easy for you.
But don't forget it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too
You know I don't believe it
When I see that you don't need me
You know can't believe you
When you say that you won't see me
When you think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry.
I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place
Either with or without you.
The five years we have had have been such good times
But now I think it's time I live my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do
You know I can't believe it
When you say that you won't see me
You know I don't believe you
When you say that you don't need me
You've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry.
The whole wise men who journey from the east
How a little baby boy brought the people so much joy
How a little baby boy brought the people so much joy
But why a simple herdsmen such as I
Right below the star that shines on high
How a little baby boy brought the people so much joy
We're laughing till we cry
Dance in the moonlight
Burning while we're young
Set fire to our lungs
Till what's left is none
Drowning in the tides
I think I fell in love with you for all the wrong reasons
I think you felt you needed me for all the right reasons
I held on and kept the faith for all the wrong reasons
And when it's dark and you're alone
Or you're with someone you don't know
And that's why I stay for all the wrong reasons
I know you only told me lies for all the right reasons
And that's why I stay for all the wrong reasons
Love is but a song we sing
Fear's the way we die
You can make the mountains ring
Or make the angels cry
Though the bird is on the wing
And you may not know why
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
Some may come and some may go
When the one that left us here
Returns for us at last
We are but a moment's sunlight
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
If you hear the song I sing
You hold the key to love and fear
All in your trembling hand
Just one key unlocks them both
It's there at your command
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
Somebody stake when you know she has got to go
And like a mouse that tries to catch the cat
Like a dog that runs to fast gets hit by a car
Now I find my self apart.
I don't want to be like you
I never wanted you to be like fucking me.
Weeks passed and I lied
Month passed and it felt like I want to die.
When you talk of a girl
When you talk of a skirt
When you talk of a can
Never forget that woman is a heart
That woman is a brain
All over again I don't wanna be caught in that
I don't want to be like you
I don't want to be like you
I never wanted you to be like fucking me
Weeks passed and I lied
Is it blood seeping out of my yellow bag
A dark red spot which is growing big and red and the drops are black
I try to open up the zipper but it blocks by hair
Cool down breathing speaking softly to me
Put the root of this plant into her mouth
Fix her head on the corpse
Love this lady till your death with honesty
As the mother said hide her in my room
She wakes up with horrified eyes and I realize
She takes me throws me nails me to the ground
Opens the yellow bag I hear the zipper's sound
So you think life should be gay
But You're wasting your times away
Now you see me standing here and I say I'm down
So you think it would be easy to play
Drop your sorrow down into a deep frying pan.
Then you'll see we fake it all up.
I know all your stories
Never did they bore me more
Beauty of a million years may die
So I think that all my thinking's enough
Thanksgiving Yeah giving away presents
Away but I'm still down.
And I'm puking while I'm wandering around
I'm turning and falling to the ground to the leafs
That smell I love is humid in the air and I'm feeling
The decay with a bitch in my chair with a whore in
My head with my lady in my heart I start disintegrating
And he finally got himself down in the streets hard to remember
All our dreams are dreams of fun
Shoot me and I'll drink you
Into the shade I'll shrink you
Finally we're done and stare up into the sky
Flat on our backs we lie in quicksand
Slowly my hand flies up and away
With the yellow bird driven by
I think I'll come to sin
And what glory the sand in my pants
We cannot fight getting tanned
All the limits banned
Like a beam of light through a bottle
Like a beam of light through a bottle
Bugs crawling up our spine
And the memory is mine
I'm a grain of sand in your hand
Yeah that would be fine
I kiss the blisters on your feet
A lizard's eye I greet
I'm afraid there's no aid till we get laid
Into the nightlife time's right no flight
Like a beam of light through a bottle
Like a beam of light through a bottle
Like a beam of light through a bottle
I think I'll come to sin
Shocking in the sand with me
Like a beam of light through a bottle
Like a beam of light through a bottle
I think I'll come to sin
Shocking in the sand with me
Like a beam of light through a bottle
Like a beam of light through a bottle
Plants were the aim on his mind
But plants became disqualified
Stroke it hit god's creature
Stroking all god's creatures
Stroke it hit god's creature
Stroking all god's creatures
Stroke it hit god's creature
Stroking all god's creatures
Thank you for tuning in
We have next to us some bands to come
My lovely senorita is sweeter than the apples grown in winter
So I decide to kill that swine and I'm gonna do it now.
He pierces him up with his horns and tramples him until the guts run out
I'm just a boy who's inventions are bad
And the story is to be continued...
The swallows turn in blueish height and we are married full of fright.
Star to life on earth. All angels found a heaven here to work and learn and
Disappear to learn again that all is one to gather round and have some fun.
Cellar and go to work.
What fuck above do I have to thank
That I'm here to live in this shit I don't
Wanna complain about the acid rain
And I wish I could just once see the moon
Though I'm deeply sick right away...
It's like dancing in the sun
Having anything you wish to come
Then it suddenly smiles your way
And you have an easy day.
But the clothes they wear look rather cool to me.
I wanna bake a cake but I don't know how.
Roses roses bloom in red in daytime
But when the sun it fades all of their
Keep their grace but it just fades
Bloody steak I mask myself into the
Night with You smoking pot with You
Is cool and everything that we do too
We're going to the disco You're
Swaying like a queen but it hits me
Hardly that Your beauty is unseen.
Roses bloom in red for roses have no
Heart and it feels like roses will be
I had a pretty dream about a little
And boy she lifted up her skirt tasting her
Salty honey I got stuck between her
Tights I wake up on a toilet the girl sits
Next to me sitting on the tap she lifts one
Lip begins to pee right into my mouth then
The walls are falling down demons in my
Garden winter stairs in dressing gowns if
You think that time is matched You can
And the fighting it went on
Urban laughter in the skies
In the end there was no one to survive
Oh that was an evil day
Urban laughter took me far away
Still can hear them now
Lost my legs and now I'm to the ground
Giant horses armed in red
With fire nostrils oh they never bled
Their ghoulish riders made of tar
Crushed my head and turned my brain to jar
Their whipping tails tearing right through raw rocks
Still can hear them now
And it feels like emptiness is taking over
And it hurts like everything is gone and over
This letter is out for you today
Wrote all the sorrow out of myself
Wrote all my sorrow far away
It's been a pity far too long
I see you dance in angry ways
You're screaming at the pearl in your shell
Where is it you're going
I'm getting stronger every day
Learn to live my life alone these days
And I am falling down
My fingers stretch and then I feel it rise inside of me
That feeling that I used to dream
Where is it you're going
I'm getting stronger every day
Learn to live my life alone these days
Where is it you're going
I'm getting stronger every day
Learn to fuck myself alone these days
Somewhere there's a heart and it's angry
Somewhere there's a place that I belong
Somewhere there's a place in which I grow strong
Is it you way to save my day or is it that you're just on my mind
Somewhere there's a girl and she is empty somehow
She can't find me anymore
And I stand here on the door with a broken birthday present
And I ain't got no mother fucking glue.
Is it the way I spent my day or is it that you're on my mind
And I just can't wait to see you here next to me
In my pool oh that's cool oh that's cool yeah so cool
To the man dressed in pink
And that I don't think that's funny at all.
It's god's sake that you can't fly
Said the bat to the rat
Into the night worse than a virus
You'd grow and betray us
And that's not desired
At all the trout denies
All of my money is gone
I won't slay the bunny
The clerk and I were friends
At the night the bat and rat
Said good bye without a fight
The fisherman he tries
All his life and that's why his baby died.
Your drop dead beautiful face
And you were dragging one lace
I'll just stick to you like glue
I'm lovesick and dream about you
Like a tick I will chew
And you will get me through
Like a tune to a song
Like the moon to the sun
When girls like you pass my way
I get a kick out of following you
And pigs might fly so all I do is that
I'll just stick to you like glue
I'm lovesick and dream
Like a tune to a song
Like the moon to the sun
I behold your shape and bloom
Endless time in endless rooms
There is no one else but you
And you're shining on and on
Like a tune to a song
Like the moon to the sun
When girls like you pass my way
I'll just stick to you like glue
Staring at the wavelength
I just may get a little closer
Sultry nights full of fright
Soft soap me down in your coma
For my whole life I was a loner
But now I am a roamer
To where the sky is blue
To where the sky is blue
Sailing the seven seas
You hardly get the chance to ski
You can change your homes one thousand times
Still your problems roam
To where you're all alone
Soft soap me down in your coma
For my whole life I was a loner
But now I am a roamer
To where the sky is blue
To where the sky is blue
With puffy clouds and brew
Yeah where the sky is blue
Turn of your fright man
Pretending that you're Fred Astaire
And you think you're Fred Astaire
Oh you're dancing everywhere
Yeah where the sky is blue
To where the sky is blue
With puffy clouds and brew
Yeah where the sky is blue
Turn of your fright man
Pretending that you're Fred Astaire
Just raise your arms and fly
To where the sky is blue
To where the sky is blue
With puffy clouds and brew
Friday night and I got wings
You feel good but I feel better
Lazy bone on my way home
Uh I'm feeling much better
The day was hard greasy as lard
Looking downtown with a face that shivers
Looking downtown there's a lot of trouble
And I don't feel like going out tonight
It will be best that I'll stay home
The phone rings hey it is my darling
That you'll stay at the party hearty
Looking downtown with a face that shivers
Looking downtown there's a lot of trouble
And I don't feel like going out tonight
Like going out tonight
Like going out tonight
Home sweet home but all alone
Where's a lover when you need one
Maybe I was too unkind cause
Looking downtown with a face that shivers
Looking downtown there's a lot of trouble
It feels like I'll be going out yeah
Looking downtown with a face that shivers
Looking downtown there's a lot of party
Feels like I'll be going out tonight
I'll meet you at the party
I'm leading my life just the way I like it
Don't burn my ass if it's not tight
Guy since you ran away
I'm swearing that I'm bearing
For my telling you telling you lies
I'm smoking till I'm choking
Blast there is a hole in my soul
All the trouble lord in me
All the trouble lord in me
I'm pushed through a funnel
With my eyes in a tunnel
Bearing all the swearing
The thing I need is you
I'm swearing that I'm bearing
For my telling you telling you lies
I wish I was a stamp so you'd lick me
I wish I was a football so you'd kick me
I wish I was a bra to feel your nipples hardening
Tear my bloom apart and finally find
I'm swearing that I'm bearing
Blood that runs through my veins
Blood that runs through my veins
Blood that runs through my veins
Creating the mammal man
Before it gets thrown
Blood that runs through my veins
Blood that runs through my veins
Creating the mammal man
Blood that runs through my veins
Blood that runs through my veins
Creating the mammal man
Flies through the sky's sweet marble rain
Light breezes lift you up again
Up again where you belong
Up again where you belong
And oh so strange... oh so strange... oh so strange...
I wanna talk to you now
I wanna talk to you now
I wanna talk to you now
I wanna talk to you now
Freckled red dotted butterfly
Fly away leave me alone
Search for the place she calls her home
I wanna talk to you now
I wanna talk to you now
I wanna talk to you now
I wanna talk to you now
Why don't you walk to me now
I wanna walk with you now
I wanna talk to you now
Finally found the words how
Finally found the words how
Thought about leaving today
Driving down to the lake
The lakeside it is black
But please don't ask me
You're looking beautiful today
Nothing else matters anyway
The lakeside it is black
But please don't ask me
All that is left decays
A single note rings on and on and on
The lake called us today
No use to refuse this anyway
The lakeside still is black
We wont be coming back
But please don't ask me
All that is left decays
A single note rings on and on and on
The wind rips our sails
A single note rings on and on and on
Leaves are shaking in the wind
Some let go and drift within
Others just lose their green
And it feels so obscene
Flies are gathering on my knees
The wind it shakes the autumn leaves
I love the heat when I am cold
When I give up I receive gold
I cannot laugh at your bad jokes
Summer's over with a sigh in the sky
With a sigh in the sky...
Flies are gathering on my knees
The wind it shakes the autumn leaves
And I am so amused to see
That both of them will leave
Both of them will leave
Wait until happiness is here
Happiness she says is a state with no fear
Wait until happiness is here
Cause happiness she says is a state with no fear
The water's sleazy and sort of cool
Waiting till happiness is here
That none of them will survive
It messes up your life
With the struggle of the gossip that you smuggle
Yeah I still love you
Through the silverfish that rumble
For your dandruff late at night
And my mouth and ears and nostrils
Even the pants are hosting ants
Yeah I still love you
Through the silverfish that rumble
For your dandruff late at night
Pretty weird my pretty dreams
Singing like there's ringingly no one
They come back and die
Through the silverfish that rumble
For your dandruff late at night
So if you think that you're extreme
The girl who don't know ween
And who don't mind to see them
Dancing with the dandruff
You don't mind to see them
Dancing with the dandruff late at night
Well if you really think dancing is boring
Shake your head and you can smoke some crack
Dancing is my aphrodisiac
So if you really think dancing is boring
Shake your head and you can smoke some crack
Come here and dance with me
I ain't got no leprosy
I ain't got no one to swing around with me
Come here and dance with me
I ain't got no leprosy
I ain't got no one to swing around with me
So if you hear the people say that there is someone
So I don't really think dancing is boring
Shake your head and you can smoke some crack
Come here and dance with me
I ain't got no leprosy
I ain't got no one to swing around with me
Come here and dance with me
I ain't got no leprosy
I ain't got no one to swing around with me
Come here and dance with me
And I'm losing my faith
In a world so full of rage and hate and aggression and style
So I don't really think dancing is boring
I know how it feels to be part of the crowd
And there's no one there yes there's no one there
Who just dares to move to the sound
Well I don't think that you think dancing is boring
I don't think that you will smoke that c
Come here and dance with me
I ain't got no leprosy
I ain't got no one to swing around with me
Come here and dance with me
All of that gold I'd give
Give it to you gladly
If I could roam the world
All of that gold now give
Into the river freely
Burn all your clothes in the cave of destiny...
Send in the dark clouds
Stop me from breathing
Where the grass is white
Send in the dark clouds
Start my secret bloodstain nights
Of rocks and of stone it feels
My body cannot move freely
A river of tears is pouring my sadness dear
Endlessly I will poison
Poison the roots of that tree
Send in the dark clouds
Stop me from breathing
Where the grass is white
Send in the dark clouds
Start my secret bloodstain nights
So this is what they call the end
Somebody tell me that this is just something in my
That I dream or that I imagine of the end
People walking down the streets
Their pale faces to the ground
And their boots in the streets
On a dust that is making no sound
And I don't wanna be a nosy guy
Excuse me mister could you please say
Having little fun today
Just a little fun today
I'm living in a lack of time
Attract by the ones who lie
I cannot even open an eye
And I don't wanna be the girlfriend
Of your boyfriend anyway
Cause there is so much to do
And there is nothing left to say
We've got that low fine attitude
That's something hammering my mood
Come dip your toes in
Just a little fun today
Just a little fun today
And I sink down to the bottom of the lake
There there is no escape
And I can't say is the outside world is it just a fake
Just a little fun today
Just a little fun today
She was walking through the burning city
Spotting her chat white brain strutting
I can walk straight on that line
Not knowing where to go or what to do
When she found herself gone
She found herself grinding
Now that every single thought
Now that every thought of doubt is gone
Hi daddy say hi hi daddy
My precious little diamond
Smelling your underwear
Into your daddy's house
Tearing my life apart
You're the one I lost my heart
Blood rising in the streets
Vomit and the wall is red
I'm burning cause your dog is dead
Now that every single thought
Now that every thought of doubt is gone
Now that every single thought
Now that every thought of doubt is gone
The morning ages for you
Raging to be as bright as shooting stars
Shooting stars seldom get through
We're staring down into the fire
It's shape is buried in the land of dreams
In the land of dreams...
Keeps on pushing me backwards higher
Slowly through that ring of fire
Keeps on pushing me backwards higher
It feels like there is something in the way I dream
I carry up a heavy heated rock
And when I let it drop
The river walks with me instead
Sir barleycorn he needs believing
I believe in sir john
His shape is buried in the land of dreams
In the land of dreams...
On pushing me backwards higher
Slowly through that ring of fire
Keeps on pushing me backwards higher
Slowly through that ring of fire
Keeps on pushing me backwards higher
Slowly through that ring of fire
Keeps on pushing me backwards higher
Turn out to be so slow
I keep quiet as a mouse
Some stranger entered my house
Slaughtered my goldfish with a golden knife
I cannot but sit hide and be so quiet
Keeps on pushing me backwards higher
Slowly through that ring of fire
Keeps on pushing me backwards higher
You know how to drive
I need to rest a while
And don't drive like a mad man
Waking up in a town called seven
Where the girls look pretty
And they dance like heavenly creatures
With all these features that only boys
Waking up into a restaurant
I'm rolling all over the place
I'm rolling all over the place
You're smiling I'm flying
My god you got a heroins face
Birdies come and birdies go
Birdies dancing in black snow
Birdies everywhere I go
By by back on the street again
Missing nothing but the wallet and my teeth are in
No more stops by the cops
Reminds me of that song she sang
About birds and on an on
Rolling all over the place
My god you got a heroins face
Birdies come and birdies go
Birdies dancing in black snow
Birdies everywhere I go
And I wanna be a bird
Though I know it is absurd
I would fly above the herd
And then I'd wait outside
And wait outside you're house
Facing the eye of the cat
Johnny slowly away...
With all these strange timeless men
Oh waiter we're waiting for luck and for love
And he left it no doubt
Oh waiter we're waiting for luck and for love
Johnny slowly away...
With all these strange timeless men
Oh waiter we're waiting for luck and for love
And he left it no doubt
I thought that I was smart
When I took someone's car
But I failed to check the breaks
Being art is watching what's coming round
And then expect what's coming next
Cause everybody else wants sex
Smart being smart is art
Being art is just what you make of
Just what you make of it
Smart being smart is art
Are bothering my eyes
And oh my face is such a disgrace
And I am hopelessly deranged
Are flapping and those flies
Are gathering round my body
Wondering what the next thing will be
Cause everybody else wants sex
Smart being smart is art
Being art is just what you make of
Just what you make of it
Smart being smart is art
It's just not the point to find a way
How to lose your chick
You're shaking mommies money tree
In search of a charming poetry
Until you wind up caught in cost
With all the cash that you have lost
Smart being smart is art
Being art is just what you make of
Just what you make of it
I'm dreaming I'm the guy on a boat in jaws
With no one around there to wake my charms
But a shark dragging me into the sea
Waking up and early in the morning
Got my fishing rod and the sky was a burning
There is a queen of trouts in the sea
But then she came to me
Other thoughts appeared to me
Many thoughts appeared to me
Was it the heat the booze or the weed
When all at once I heard her speak
Dear boy thanks for setting me free
My lovely trout much more I'll do
Come let me swim with you
Cause there is nothing else to do
She was the queen of trouts in the sea
And she was the queen of trouts here for me
Splashing the water I could breathe
Though I could hardly believe
I was sharing someone's dream
Oh lord above don't wake me up
Cause so much I enjoy my luck
And promise ill believe
Uh queen of trouts in the sea
You know that you are everything to me
And you are the queen of trouts here for me
You know that you are everything to me
You know that you are everything to me
You know that you are everything
We're dreaming while thoughtlessly
Nothing is better than
Welcome to the pow wow
I choose to hate people when they're not polite
Come tripping with me into the power of god
Stripping in the power of love for the gods
Welcome to the pow wow
Above your head your body is lead
Sleeping while you're down fighting with the living dead
A combat of spirits even numbers are wrong
The carpet the blood and your body feels warm
Come tripping with me into the power of god
Stripping in the power of love for the gods
Just to see her ghost
Where I have seen her first
I close my eyes it's time to go
But your pills they're making me slow
Hold me close she said baby
Close your beautiful eyes baby
I close my eyes it's time to go
But your pills they're making me slow
Turn back soldier your bullet's gone
Out there in the fields I cry for mommies hands
Out there in the fields I lie and understand
That something went wrong
I close my eyes it's time to go
But your pills they're making me slow
Turn back soldier your bullet's gone
These boys are strong
I'm stopping at the drive inn
Just to see her ghost
I'm stopping at the drive inn
Saturday night nothing to do
Chose a bra and then shine your shoes
Saturday night nothing to do
Show me baby where it hurts
Kissing snowflakes for desert
See you in the alligator
Maybe in the elevator
Show me baby where it's at
Licking raindrops from your hat
Alison may queen of the day
Cause gold is what you need
I'm talking bout that gold down in your soul
With any type of life
But I tell you it's worth digging for that gold
Grubbing you come across grubs
That one day will be bugs
Bugging your explorations till you're old
And your sack is full of scraps
For some your heart is warm the others crap oblivion
But nothing ever happens in that hole
But nothing ever happens in your soul
A nation shocked by pictures of a snow covered bike
The girl she soon is dead
We wonder who she met
She is buried oh so deep
And no one will come to take her home
And she's digging and digging...
But nothing ever happens in that hole
And she's digging and digging...
Her fingernails are broken and sore
And she's digging and digging...
No one ever releases her soul
And she's digging and digging...
I will love her till the end of time...
Neither human nor beast
Demons feast on it's soul
But nothing ever happens in that hole
And nothing ever happens in your soul
But nothing ever happens in that hole
Her fingernails are broken and sore
I'm not blessed with a soul
That will tear out your soul
And I'll clean out your soul...
Sweeter with my porcupine
Wandering these skies
And though they are pretty wise
At the willow we shall meet
And we're at the end of the rainbow
Pass me some of your delight
Spring beams from the sky
Molecules they swing and sing
And birdies passing by
Fauna's feeble wakening
Warming up for a brand new year
Buzzing through my mind
There's a goddess in my life
Sowing love instead of strife
I'm the end of the rainbow
There's a goddess in my life
She's felling fine now that she's mine
She's sowing love instead of strife
I smell your heartbeat
I'm leading my life just the way I like it
Don't burn my ass if it's not tight
Guy since you ran away
I'm swearing that I'm bearing
For my telling you telling you lies
I'm smoking till I'm choking
Blast there is a hole in my soul
All the trouble lord in me
All the trouble lord in me
I'm pushed through a funnel
With my eyes in a tunnel
Bearing all the swearing
The thing I need is you
I'm swearing that I'm bearing
For my telling you telling you lies
I wish I was a stamp so you'd lick me
I wish I was a football so you'd kick me
I wish I was a bra to feel your nipples hardening
Tear my bloom apart and finally find
I'm swearing that I'm bearing
Chose it's legs when you intend to fire
Shoot it's legs and it'll be going down
The police officer yells his famous last words
His one and only shot
Cause an arrow and a bow that is all he's got
He's been in trouble before
And he's fed up with the killing
Corpses that are losing
Chose it's legs when you intend to fire
You know how to drive
I need to rest a while
And don't drive like a mad man
Waking up in a town called seven
Where the girls look pretty
And they dance like heavenly creatures
With all these features that only boys
Waking up into a restaurant
I'm rolling all over the place
I'm rolling all over the place
You're smiling I'm flying

Though I know it is absurd

And then I'd wait outside
And wait outside you're house
Facing the eye of the cat
Your drop dead beautiful face
And you were dragging one lace
I'll just stick to you like glue
I'm lovesick and dream about you
Like a tick I will chew
And you will get me through
Like a tune to a song
Like the moon to the sun
When girls like you pass my way
I get a kick out of following you
And pigs might fly so all I do is that
I'll just stick to you like glue
I'm lovesick and dream
Like a tune to a song
Like the moon to the sun
I behold your shape and bloom
Endless time in endless rooms
There is no one else but you
And you're shining on and on
Like a tune to a song
Like the moon to the sun
When girls like you pass my way
I'll just stick to you like glue
That doesn't fall for you and doesn't cry
When we're dancing at the discotheque
We're dancing till I can't take
No more of your beautiful moves
Let's go don't say no
That doesn't fall for you and doesn't cry
And he's a fancy with them ladies
He spent all of his time with his dad
He sleeps on the couch and he sighs
He pushes his eyeballs so hard
And he sleeps on the couch at his daddy's place
And dreams about the ways that he's going to be killed
Until the phone it screams so loud
He's afraid of the night
All these creatures that bite
He's afraid of the light
All alone there at night
I'm dreaming I'm the guy on a boat in jaws
With no one around there to wake my charms
But a shark dragging me into the sea
Waking up and early in the morning
Got my fishing rod and the sky was a burning
There is a queen of trouts in the sea
But then she came to me
Other thoughts appeared to me
Many thoughts appeared to me
Was it the heat the booze or the weed
When all at once I heard her speak
Dear boy thanks for setting me free
My lovely trout much more I'll do
Come let me swim with you
Cause there is nothing else to do
She was the queen of trouts in the sea
And she was the queen of trouts here for me
Splashing the water I could breathe
Though I could hardly believe
I was sharing someone's dream
Oh lord above don't wake me up
Cause so much I enjoy my luck
And promise ill believe
Uh queen of trouts in the sea
You know that you are everything to me
And you are the queen of trouts here for me
You know that you are everything to me
You know that you are everything to me
You know that you are everything
We're dreaming while thoughtlessly
Nothing is better than
People walking down the streets
Their pale faces to the ground
And their boots in the streets
On a dust that is making no sound
And I don't wanna be a nosy guy
Excuse me mister could you please say
Having little fun today
Just a little fun today
I'm living in a lack of time
Attract by the ones who lie
I cannot even open an eye
And I don't wanna be the girlfriend
Of your boyfriend anyway
Cause there is so much to do
And there is nothing left to say
We've got that low fine attitude
That's something hammering my mood
Come dip your toes in
Just a little fun today
Just a little fun today
And I sink down to the bottom of the lake
There there is no escape
And I can't say is the outside world is it just a fake
Just a little fun today
Just a little fun today
People disappear like socks in the wash
Mixing up the rest into a state of pissed off
Fixing up the feelings in a rendezvous
We sorted out and decided to meet
The waiter checks me out for the very last time
Got me so frustrated now I'm on my feet
Eyes staring right through you
Tried to phone you up at home and on your mobile
The answering machine says
Please leave a message after the beep
I'm no more insulted it just gives me the creeps
The saddest guy with a vanished girlfriend
Trains go by fast they split up the night
Someone smiling sits there right across my bed
I'm staring right into his yellow dark eyes
Fear is flooding in something hits my head
Eyes staring right through you
Time's running out for you
Time is back head is cracked
I can't sleep there is no need
I know you're here there is no fear
Just like socks in the wash
Eyes staring right through you
Time's running out for you
Checking my time like some old school clock
Ticking really loud when you're winding me up
Saying hello to all the five people that I know
I got a bag and plenty of time
Elliot Smith is over there
With a knife in his chest and blood in his black hair
And I see him smoking Winston cigarettes
Blood that runs through my veins
Blood that runs through my veins
Blood that runs through my veins
Creating the mammal man
Before it gets thrown
Blood that runs through my veins
Blood that runs through my veins
Creating the mammal man
Blood that runs through my veins
Blood that runs through my veins
Creating the mammal man
Welcome to the pow wow
I choose to hate people when they're not polite
Come tripping with me into the power of god
Stripping in the power of love for the gods
Welcome to the pow wow
Above your head your body is lead
Sleeping while you're down fighting with the living dead
A combat of spirits even numbers are wrong
The carpet the blood and your body feels warm
Come tripping with me into the power of god
Stripping in the power of love for the gods
Well if you really think dancing is boring
Shake your head and you can smoke some crack
Dancing is my aphrodisiac
So if you really think dancing is boring
Shake your head and you can smoke some crack
Come here and dance with me
I ain't got no leprosy
I ain't got no one to swing around with me
Come here and dance with me
I ain't got no leprosy
I ain't got no one to swing around with me
So if you hear the people say that there is someone
So I don't really think dancing is boring
Shake your head and you can smoke some crack
Come here and dance with me
I ain't got no leprosy
I ain't got no one to swing around with me
Come here and dance with me
I ain't got no leprosy
I ain't got no one to swing around with me
Come here and dance with me
And I'm losing my faith
In a world so full of rage and hate and aggression and style
So I don't really think dancing is boring
I know how it feels to be part of the crowd
And there's no one there yes there's no one there
Who just dares to move to the sound
Well I don't think that you think dancing is boring
I don't think that you will smoke that c
Come here and dance with me
I ain't got no leprosy
I ain't got no one to swing around with me
Come here and dance with me
Cellar and go to work.
What fuck above do I have to thank
That I'm here to live in this shit I don't
Wanna complain about the acid rain
And I wish I could just once see the moon
Though I'm deeply sick right away...
It's like dancing in the sun
Having anything you wish to come
Then it suddenly smiles your way
And you have an easy day.
But the clothes they wear look rather cool to me.
I wanna bake a cake but I don't know how.
All our dreams are dreams of fun
Shoot me and I'll drink you
Into the shade I'll shrink you
Finally we're done and stare up into the sky
Flat on our backs we lie in quicksand
Slowly my hand flies up and away
With the yellow bird driven by
I think I'll come to sin
And what glory the sand in my pants
We cannot fight getting tanned
All the limits banned
Like a beam of light through a bottle
Like a beam of light through a bottle
Bugs crawling up our spine
And the memory is mine
I'm a grain of sand in your hand
Yeah that would be fine
I kiss the blisters on your feet
A lizard's eye I greet
I'm afraid there's no aid till we get laid
Into the nightlife time's right no flight
Like a beam of light through a bottle
Like a beam of light through a bottle
Like a beam of light through a bottle
I think I'll come to sin
Shocking in the sand with me
Like a beam of light through a bottle
Like a beam of light through a bottle
I think I'll come to sin
Shocking in the sand with me
Like a beam of light through a bottle
Like a beam of light through a bottle
We're robbing Peter to pay Paul
Miles and miles yet to go
And the pouring rain that hurts me so
I'm tired of the rain and I'm tired of all
All of the sudden out of the rain
You're standing there hitchhiking
When I think about the days
I spent without you babe
I spent without your grace
You got a tape yeah put it on
Well if you wanna smoke
Is exactly what I seek
Dropping down your pure landscape
Ever I am truly loving you
Now Halloween is here today
And in the streets there's party hey
You've got monsters goblins trolls and slaves ghosts and
Zombies from their graves
We got such a spooky masquerade
We open the door kids run away
When I think about the days
I spent without you babe
I spent without your grace
Ever I'm truly loving you yes I do
I see pictures of red splotches and patterns of purple green
Sparkles silvery smears and I'm drifting out to be part of
The night and of the day when we talk about elephants
I'm a dog tied to the butchers door
I can smell the magic and I want some more
But the door is closed
I'm a pair of thick glasses on a little boy's nose
I can smell the magic and I'd love to get close
How come that all the others
Get the things that I bother
How come that all the others
Get the bigger brothers
There's a sign hanging right in front of my face
I'm a cripple Christmas tree for sale
But how come that I'm staying here alone in the cold
How come that all the others
Get the bigger brothers
I'm not good in anything
Well that's my destination
It's a sign hanging right
There's a sign hanging right in front of my face
How come that all the others
He used to be a shy boy
Until I made him my boy
I never missed a heartbeat
Just sitting in the back seat
I'm gonna give him all my love
One thing I know he's dreaming of
I wanna squeeze and hold him tight
But don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
Don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
Everything we put together
Seems to last forever
He knows about a good time
Gonna make him all mine
I like the way he turns me on
I wanna keep him all to myself
If my heart could beat that strong
But don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
Don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
I'm gonna give him all my love
One thing I know he's dreaming of
I wanna squeeze and hold him tight
But don't it make you
But don't it make you
I like the way he turns me on
I wanna keep him all to myself
If my heart could beat that strong
But don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
Don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
But don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
Don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
If you feel that something missing
Made of push turns to shove
You feel that something lacking
When the going gets tough
I'm not asking anything
Just some love in return
I'm the one you need for sure
Hear the siren coming down the street
And my healing powers
From your head down to your feet
If you feel that something missing
In your dreams at night
May need my medical science
To put you back right
When the going gets tough
I'm not asking anything
Just some love in return
I'm the one you need for sure
Hear the siren coming down the street
And my healing powers
You think it's all so easy
When you got your name in lights
Money comes in bag fulls
And you spend it every night
When you fly from place to place
Up at six each morning
Slapping make up on your face...
I wish you were in our shoes
I wish you could be us
Washing all your laundry
And riding on the bus
I wish you were in our shoes
I wish you could be us
Washing all your laundry
And riding on the bus
Speaks to you at noon
Never knowing you made them
Thinking they made you
Double trouble everywhere
I haven't slept a wink...
I wish you were in our shoes
I wish you could be us
Washing all your laundry
And riding on the bus
I wish you were in our shoes
I wish you could be us
Washing all your laundry
And riding on the bus
What a shambles of a meeting
Don't know what to say
What a shambles of a bus ride
What a shambles of a day...
I wish you were in our shoes
I wish you could be us
Washing all your laundry
I was walking down the street
When this boy started following me
Now I ignored all the things he said
He moved me in every way
He was really saying something
Really saying something
He flirted every step of the way
I could hear every word he'd say
My resistance was getting low
And my feelings started to show
My heart started thumping
Blood pressure jumping
He was really saying something
Really saying something
He walked me to my door
I agreed to see him once more
Lady like it may not be
But he moved me tremendously
He was really saying something
Really saying something
Cheers then here's two old friends
We thought we'd never say goodbye
But those good times came to an end
And it's not worth another try
But feeling's not the same
Try to relive what we once did
Its just a silly game
Cheers then here's two old friends
We thought we'd never say goodbye
But those good times came to an end
And it's not worth another try
Together everyday and night
When you and me were young
Cheers then here's two old friends
We thought we'd never say goodbye
But those good times came to an end
And it's not worth another try
Time that lapsed a bond collapsed
We never planned for that
You felt betrayed I let you down
You're better on your own
Old before their time
It was there only crime
How come I love them now
How come I love them more
But all I wanted to do when I was
Old was to walk out the door
I shouldn't have known at all
How come I love them now
How come I love them more
But all I wanted to do when I was
Old was to walk out the door
Who's right who's wrong
Two brothers two more hearts
Too hard to take it all
How come I love them now
How come I love them more
But all I wanted to do when I was
The way that I love you
Go on and kiss him goodbye
To comfort and cheer you
When all those sad tears
Go on and kiss him goodbye
Hey young London you're looking good
Dressing up like you know you should
Hey young London you're the brightest star
So you ride about got to get that far
Well I've read your face
If I share your tastes
You know the night spots
If you wanna stay hip
Have you flown to Paris
Hope you have a good trip
You know that we don't care
Hey young London you're looking good
The lights are less well that's understood
Hey young London take your time and go
The girls are young but they act so old
The same pub each night
Boys looking for a fight
Each others self control
You know you've reached your goal
You know that we don't care
Hey young London you're looking good
You got the money you can choose your moods
Hey young London you're a bright young thing
Your private houses are a public thing
She sees a dead still light
And his pants on tight
With his girl at his side
He doesn't need his breaks
And a smile on his face
For all the risks he takes
Hey young London you're looking good
Dressing up like you know you should
Hey young London you're the brightest star
So you ride about got to get that far
Hey young London you're looking good
The lights are less well that's understood
Hey young London take your time and go
The girls are young but they act so old
I got a boy got boy trouble
I got a man I just don't want
Got myself in soapy bubble
He wants love but I don't
And when I see him on the street
And when he asks if we could meet
I tell him another day
Boy trouble boy trouble
He thinks he's here to stay
Boy trouble boy trouble
He brings me sweets he brings me flowers
He says he wants to be my friend
He rings me nearly every hour
There goes that phone again
He wants to take me out somewhere
Got tickets for a show
I say I've got to wash my hair
Boy trouble boy trouble
He thinks he's here to stay
Boy trouble boy trouble
Boy trouble boy trouble
He thinks he's here to stay
Boy trouble boy trouble
And when I see him on the street
And when he asks if we could meet
I tell him another day
Boy trouble boy trouble
He thinks he's here to stay
Boy trouble boy trouble
And I wish I was still sleeping
Full of dreams of wishful thinking
And I wish that you were with me
Forgotten old memories of you
Wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
Wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
And I know I should be sleeping
Do you know my hopes are sinking
And I wish that you were with me
Forgotten old memories of you
Wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
Wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
And I'm always thinking of you
And I'm always thinking of you
And I'm always dreaming of you
Always I'm weeping in dreams
Wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
Wish you were here with me
With your smart tall good looks
You spread your wings
Your better than it looks
Good times from the clothes you took
Your friends all share your hollow looks
With friends and cars for style
Your response stands out a mile
Good times from the clothes you took
Your friends all share your hollow looks
Good times from the clothes you took
Your friends all share your hollow looks
It was a still hot day
I was sitting doing nothing
When I saw him cruising by
As he turned and he winked his eye
And he knows how to use it
When I first saw him cruising
It was none of my choosing
And I don't wanna lose him
And he knows how to use it
He stole my heart away
Said he'd better decide
And he knows how to use it
When I first saw him cruising
It was none of my choosing
And I don't wanna lose him
And he knows how to use it
He stole my heart away
It was a still hot day
I was sitting doing nothing
When I saw him cruising by
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies
You keep saying to me time and time again
You'd be true to me if I don't see other men
It only took one call to prove me right
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies
Don't you remember when you always said to me
But if you turn your back on a promise okay
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies
Still you keep telling me
I seen you in the mirror when the story began
Your brains are locked away but I love your company
I only ever leave you when you got no money
I got no emotions for anybody else
You better understand I'm in love with myself
I don't wanna your body in a runaround suit
You follow me around like a pretty pot of glue
I kick you in the head you got nothing to say
You come up to see me and I beat you black and blue
Ain't no moonlight after midnight
I see stupid people out looking for delight
But I'm so happy I'm feeling so fine
I look around your house and there's nothing to steal
I kick you in the brains when you get down to kneel
And the pavements are burning
But the air is so heavy and dry
Strange voices are saying
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort
This heat has got right out of hand
Leaving me here on my own
It's too hot to handle
So I got to get up and go
Leaving me here on my own
You're not the only one
Leaving me here on my own
Leaving me here on my own
You're not the only one
Leaving me here on my own
You're not the only one
Leaving me here on my own
The young don't grow up
Well not in this life
While the sneaky and snide
Innocent people walking by
No time to smile before they die
Don't call that justice
Children are starving on the street
Another one disappearing every week
Don't call that justice
But their kingdom grows cold
They'll never grow up
But they're bound to grow old
And I'll show them rough justice
The way that they did
Innocent people walking by
No time to smile before they die
Don't call that justice
Children are starving on the street
Another one disappearing every week
Don't call that justice
Innocent people walking by
No time to smile before they die
Don't call that justice
Children are starving on the street
Another one disappearing every week
Don't call that justice
While the sneaky and snide
Innocent people walking by
No time to smile before they die
Don't call that justice
Children are starving on the street
Another one disappearing every week
Don't call that justice
Innocent people walking by
No time to smile before they die
Don't call that justice
Children are starving on the street
Another one disappearing every week
Don't call that justice
He knows it isn't right but he wants to make his name
But you know you're not allowed to look them in the face
You'll never know the place until your time has come
It'll be a sunny day until his work is done
As she counts the cost of the life that's lost and twenty wasted years
He thinks he's smarter
But you know you're not allowed to look them in the face
But you know you're not allowed to look them in the face
Think of me while you're walking down the street
Scheming ways for us to meet
I know that you'd like to fool around
You know I'm the hottest thing in town
You're getting closer
I'm the queen bee baby
So you just can't fail
I'm your sweet thing baby
You're always worried that I'm not gonna stay
Haunting you every day and night
Haunting you till the early morning light
And you want me if you know what's right
You're getting closer
I'm the queen bee baby
So you just can't fail
I'm your sweet thing baby
You're always worried that I'm not gonna stay
You're always worried that I'll split the scene
I can read from your eyes that you like my style
Imagination's really running wild
If you give it a try you know it could be
So come on little baby won't you follow me
I'm your sweet thing baby
You're always worried that I'm not gonna stay
You're always worried that I'll split the scene
With your smile you're making plans
You've got the world right in the palm of your hands
Everything you touch is gold
But your future life is bought and sold
It seems to me that you've got it made
But you never show that you're afraid
Now the voices in your head
They make you scream and drive you mad
You're on a hot line to heaven
Riding on a hot line to heaven
Staring eyes as cold as stone
I want to figure the stance alone
Reaching out to cry for help
Once a man but now you're just a shell
But you're heading for an early grave
Something special to get you high
You're on a hot line to heaven
Riding on a hot line to heaven
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
It seems to me that you've got it made
But you're heading for an early grave
A thousand voices in your head
Make you scream and drive you mad
You're on a hot line to heaven
Riding on a hot line to heaven
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
You're on a hot line to heaven
Riding on a hot line to heaven
You're on a hot line to heaven
Riding on a hot line to heaven
You're on a hot line to heaven
Riding on a hot line to heaven
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Or must we still pretend
That we're really friends
Those feelings have gone
But we're not the same
And we're both to blame
There's nothing left to tell you
Nothing left to give you
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
You walk out when I walk in
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
Can't you see the state I'm in
Now the time has come
To leave the past behind
And I've made up my mind
Look at what we've done
Who needs to be ashamed
I've built my world around you
I'm better off without you
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
You walk out when I walk in
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
Can't you see the state I'm in
There's nothing left to tell you
Nothing left to give you
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
You walk out when I walk in
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
Hopes dashed to the floor
Like shattered teenage dreams
Boys living next door
A walk in the park can become a bad dream
People are staring and following me
This is my only escape from it all
Watching a film or a face on the wall
I've got a man of steel
Don't come any closer
I never want this to happen to me
Now I've got something much better in mind
A walk in the park can become a bad dream
People are staring and following me
This is my only escape from it all
Watching a film or a face on the wall
The sun shines forever
Through a child's eyes
The sun shines forever
Laughing and learning
I never believed that I'd grow old
Still I can hear the things you told
The sun has gone and the nights are cold
I sit and watch the sunset
With tears in my eyes
I sit and watch the sunset
The child in me sighs
I never believed that I'd grow old
Still I can hear the things you told
The sun has gone and the nights are cold
Call me Jenny Betty when you want me
Call me Jenny Jenny when I cry
With me big black empty handbag
You give me little lolly when me hungry
Making all the junk for the big man in Cairo
Under heavy manners in the daytime
Under heavy hula in the night
With me milkshake and no handshake
Sleeping in the morning like a tourist
Working for me money all the time
Making all the junk for the big man in Cairo
Call me Jenny Betty when you want me
Call me Jenny Jenny when I cry
With me big black empty handbag
You give me little lolly when me hungry
Making all the junk for the big man in Cairo
Making all the junk for the big man in Cairo
Pushing pushing pushing

He doesn't care what's wrong
He doesn't know what's right
Working so fast and now he's moving along
You'll never know till he's gone

Tell me what does it say
If you step out of place
Then you'll just have to pay
You'll get the blame but you won't know why

No second plans with his dirty deeds

I'm living in a darkened room
Where all the lights are low
And I've been around too long
When you've forgotten how to laugh
And when they tried to warn me
Well they didn't know the half
Come inside and shut the door
I don't care if you're rich or poor
You're always welcome that's for sure
I'm working after hours
Watching strangers come and go
But I'm putting on a show
Is be around this time next year
Come inside and shut the door
I don't care if you're rich or poor
You're always welcome that's for sure
Come inside and shut the door
I don't care if you're rich or poor
You're always welcome that's for sure
Come inside and shut the door
I don't care if you're rich or poor
You're always welcome that's for sure
With your smile you're making plans
You've got the world right in the palm of your hands
Everything you touch is gold
But your future life is bought and sold
It seems to me that you've got it made
But you never show that you're afraid
Now the voices in your head
They make you scream and drive you mad
You're on a hot line to heaven
Riding on a hot line to heaven
Staring eyes as cold as stone
I want to figure the stance alone
Reaching out to cry for help
Once a man but now you're just a shell
But you're heading for an early grave
Something special to get you high
You're on a hot line to heaven
Riding on a hot line to heaven
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
It seems to me that you've got it made
But you're heading for an early grave
A thousand voices in your head
Make you scream and drive you mad
You're on a hot line to heaven
Riding on a hot line to heaven
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
You're on a hot line to heaven
Riding on a hot line to heaven
You're on a hot line to heaven
Riding on a hot line to heaven
You're on a hot line to heaven
Riding on a hot line to heaven
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
Going up without me baby
What your mother don't know
Her good advice was a waste of time
Make hay while the sun shines
No one there to say you're wrong or right
You've waited a lifetime
Burning all your bridges tonight
This is the wild life
This is the wild life
No stone left unturned
Jump in the fire you're gonna get burned
You might lose your way
When you come out to play
But I've seen and done
Everything that they say is fun
I gotta find out for myself
In the end there's no one else
Every time I try to win I lose
Now I'm gonna make my own rules
This is the wild life
This is the wild life
No stone left unturned
Jump in the fire you're gonna get burned
You might lose your way
When you come out to play
No one there to say you're wrong or right
You've waited a lifetime
Burning all your bridges tonight
This is the wild life
This is the wild life
No stone left unturned
Jump in the fire you're gonna get burned
You might lose your way
When you come out to play
Well that's all right with me
Well your dreams won't last forever
And that's how it should be
I'm only living for your pleasure
True confessions can reveal
False impressions disappear
True confessions you come back
These obsessions of your mind
If I lead you to the water
Emotions that you torture
True confessions can reveal
False impressions disappear
True confessions you come back
These obsessions of your mind
True confessions can reveal
False impressions disappear
True confessions you come back
These obsessions of your mind
These obsessions of your mind
Remember that August night
The last time I saw your face
When they took you to another place
But now I can see you smile
There's a wall that divides us
And all the love that they deny us
Ready or not I'm coming
And I'm gonna find you baby
So you better start running
Ready or not I'm coming
And I'm gonna get to you
No matter what they do
Ready or not I'm coming
Creeping up behind you baby
Let me tell you something
Ready or not I'm coming
Bringing all my love to you
I send all my love to you
One chance to make it through
But my heart goes out to you
Ready or not I'm coming
And I'm gonna find you baby
So you better start running
Ready or not I'm coming
And I'm gonna get to you
No matter what they do
Ready or not I'm coming
Creeping up behind you baby
Let me tell you something
Ready or not I'm coming
Bringing all my love to you
I'll never give up the fight
Touching freedom on the other side
But it's getting harder now
To live and take orders
Heading over the border
Ready or not I'm coming
And I'm gonna find you baby
So you better start running
Ready or not I'm coming
And I'm gonna get to you
No matter what they do
Ready or not I'm coming
Creeping up behind you baby
Let me tell you something
Ready or not I'm coming
Bringing all my love to you
Well it's a different story
As the darkness comes around
I tried to let you know
You're going the wrong way
And the streets you thought
Would all be paved with gold
But when the wind cuts through
You'd even try to sell your soul
Just the boy next door
When they were falling in love
With that clean cut smile
Just for a little while
Walking through danger
Can't see the wrong or the right
Must be a trick of the night
Well it's a laugh a minute
Between the burning question
And the fortune in his eyes
You never let it show
Or take it the wrong way
What you came here for
With those bare faced lies
All the hurt you're feeling inside
Walking through danger
Can't see the wrong or the right
Must be a trick of the night
Walking through danger
Can't see the wrong or the right
Must be a trick of the night
Must be a trick of the night
Well it's a different story
As the darkness comes around
And the streets you thought
Would all be paved with gold
But when the wind cuts through
But there's no laughter in her face
A crowded room is a lonely place full of lies
A wicked smile a shifting glance
The passion light you feel at last
Her pleasure somehow eased the pain
Too late to chance it all again
Before we kiss the world goodbye
It's only a breath away
One more dance before you die
So tender as the music plays
Only passion in your crime
Killing the love that drives you out of your mind
When you dance with a stranger
A spinning room a cool caress
A try to hide my loneliness
Cheek to cheek we let the evening drift by
The hollow mask has disappeared
We drown our love through salty tears
We speed at night like a racing car
And now I see you as you really are
Before we kiss the world goodbye
It's only a breath away
One more dance before you die
So tender as the music plays
Only passion in your crime
Love is the last thing on your mind
When you dance with a stranger
Dance with a stranger
Before we kiss the world goodbye
It's only a breath away
One more dance before you die
So tender as the music plays
Only passion in your crime
Love is the last thing on your mind
When you dance with a stranger
For the moment to arrive
Dance with a stranger
Love is the last thing on your mind
When you dance with a stranger
Only passion in your crime
Love is the last thing on your mind
It's just another night
But the world's so cold
She takes the bus home
But they leave no trace
That dreams are not enough
Was someone real to love
And just as surely as the sun will rise
Each one knows that there'll be no surprise
Yet still each day they live in hope
There must be someone
Who's worth dying for
All we need is understanding
Maybe tomorrow we'll try again
All we need is understanding
Maybe tomorrow we'll try again
She'll sit and wonder
Where it's all gonna end
For the young to pretend
Their dreams may never see
It's not a perfect world
Yet still each day they live in hope
It's not a perfect world
Their dreams may never see
It's not a perfect world
It's not a perfect world
Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name
Her weapons were her crystal eyes
Black as the dark night she was
Got what no one else had
Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
We took the late flight
Close to heaven in the cold half light
All the pleasures of that very first night
Crystal clear in my mind
Just another reservation
We found a room with a view
Lock the door and change the sign
Just you and me together
This night could last forever
When you read the sign
It's in black and white
In plain and simple terms
Where is the laughter
I know there must have been
Oh I don't wanna stay here with you
Now the sun won't shine
Seems to cloud our celebration
While I'm waiting all alone in my room
Trying to read between the lines
Now we're not together
This night could last forever
Now we're not together
This night could last forever
When you read the sign
It's in black and white
In plain and simple terms
When she walks down Main street
The cars slow down men turn around
While the other girls are left wondering why
Now give me one good reason
Why they just don't leave her alone
She won't stop or let you take a photograph
They might turn your head around
With good loving more or less
She don't need your good advice
We all need love I guess
She ain't a cut above the rest
She ain't a cut above the others
She ain't a cut above the others
She ain't a cut above the others
She ain't a cut above the others
No one takes the time out to try
She might look the part
But in her heart of hearts
Well she's really not so different inside
They might turn your head around
With good loving more or less
She don't need your good advice
We all need love I guess
She ain't a cut above the rest
She ain't a cut above the others
She ain't a cut above the others
She ain't a cut above the others
She ain't a cut above the others
They might turn your head around
With good loving more or less
She don't need your good advice
We all need love I guess
She ain't a cut above the rest
She ain't a cut above the others
She ain't a cut above the others
She ain't a cut above the others
Lock me up in a room somewhere
Get me out of the open air
No perception of space or time
Shut me out of the wind and rain
Shelter me from the hurt and pain
No temptation to lead me on
Won't you come to the rescue
Take me to the promised land
You've got the power to show me
With you right here beside me
Dancing barefoot in the sand
Close your eyes and take me
Bolt the windows and close the door
Now there's nothing worth living for
New direction is hard to find
Dim the lights and hang up the phone
All I want is to be alone
No connection with anyone
Won't you come to the rescue
Take me to the promised land
You've got the power to show me
With you right here beside me
Dancing barefoot in the sand
Close your eyes and take me
Take me to the promised land
Take me to the promised land
Won't you come to the rescue
Take me to the promised land
You've got the power to show me
With you right here beside me
Dancing barefoot in the sand
Close your eyes and take me
It's a matter of fact
I got what you want so don't go back
So come and get it let's have some fun
I wanna show you you're the only one
Deep down down inside
It's a matter of fact
This is more than physical
I've been watching you
Come on and show me what you can do
You've got what I want stop wasting time
You're sending shivers up and down my spine
Deep down down inside
It's a matter of fact
This is more than physical
This is more than physical
This is more than physical
Deep down down inside
It's a matter of fact
This is more than physical
Another young man sucking on butane gas
I saw them reaching for a hand to hold
The next minute they were both stone cold
Don't abuse your body
Better use your brain
This generation's going insane
Better hooked on love
Don't abuse your body
Better use your brain
This generation's going insane
Better hooked on love
I found a young girl lying in a pool of blood
She had the mark of needles and a lack of love
But never dream she was bound to die
Don't abuse your body
Better use your brain
This generation's going insane
Better hooked on love
And when the street sharp man next comes around
He might touch but he never can feel
Don't abuse your body
Better use your brain
This generation's going insane
Better hooked on love
Can't change the habits of a lifetime debt
Now you're moving closer to the killing floor
You're half dead but you need to score
So don't get your kicks
The next time won't be so nice
Better hooked on love
If you're feeling bored without a thing to do
You wanna be somebody then it's up to you
I ain't trying to tell you how to live your life
You might run but you never can hide
Don't abuse your body
Better use your brain
This generation's going insane
Better hooked on love
So don't get your kicks
The next time won't be so nice
Better hooked on love
Like a ghost before me
You walked back into my life
You can't turn the clock back baby
It was far too long ago
Now you're making me confused
Now I can see so clearly
Which road I have to take
Though my heart says go
Don't make the same mistake
You're a ghost come back to haunt me
You fill my head with lies
Tried to put the past behind me
Didn't want anybody to know
Couldn't let my feelings show
Now I can see so clearly
The road I have to take
Though my heart says go
Don't make the same mistake
You're a ghost come back to haunt me
You fill my head with lies
You're a ghost come back to haunt me
You fill my head with lies
Ghost gonna haunt you
Running down the track
And when that white train starts chugging
It won't be turning back
Shaking off the black
The white train is danger
Got a one way ticket to nowhere
On the white train ooh ooh
White train white train
The white train brings danger
You gotta stand up if you want some
You gotta stand up if you want some
On the white train ooh ooh
White train white train
Got a one way ticket to nowhere
On the white train ooh ooh
It's a matter of fact
I got what you want so don't go back
So come and get it let's have some fun
I wanna show you you're the only one
Deep down down inside
It's a matter of fact
This is more than physical
I've been watching you
Come on and show me what you can do
You've got what I want stop wasting time
You're sending shivers up and down my spine
Deep down down inside
It's a matter of fact
This is more than physical
This is more than physical
This is more than physical
Deep down down inside
It's a matter of fact
This is more than physical
She shakes her head and sighs
At all life's little mysteries
And where she fits in all of these
Her friends all ask her why
She lets the days go by
They say that Scarlett should be sinking
But they don't know just what she's thinking
She's got no money but come tomorrow
What she ain't got you know she'll borrow
Life's a game and games are for playing
So listen now to what she's saying
This is Scarlett speaking
I wanna have fun while I'm still young
So you'd better listen
Captain Scarlett speaking
I aim for thrills and I shoot to kill
Clock says half past ten
She paints her face again
The night is young and Scarlett's willing
She's got no money but come tomorrow
What she ain't got you know she'll borrow
Life's a game and games are for playing
So listen now to what she's saying
This is Scarlett speaking
I wanna have fun while I'm still young
So you'd better listen
Captain Scarlett speaking
I aim for thrills and I shoot to kill
She's got no money but come tomorrow
What she ain't got you know she'll borrow

But when the wind cuts through
You been taking your time
Thought by now that you'd be mine
You just want fun that's fine by me
But baby don't waste my time
Good things come when you least expect them
And I'm right under your nose
You take your chances when you get them
So let your feelings show
Come on this is your big chance
Baby don't waste my time
I don't want to use more pressure
I get the pain you get the pleasure
That's not how it should be
I can always take a beating
Whoa but you take the cake
Don't you know I can't stand this fear
One day my heart will be
This is your big chance
Baby don't waste my time
Baby don't waste my time
I've been fooling around for a while
Now I'm making a move
Since we met I've been trying to love you

Whatever you need from me gonna let you get your way
So move your body close

I'll tell you what you want to know
I could have saved a broken heart
If I'd found out long ago
I'm just thinking about
When I waited for your call
All my friends were right
I didn't know you at all
They say you got a broken heart
Now it seems they're telling me
You've changed your wicked ways
But should I give you a second chance
And the love you threw away
How can I forgive or soon forget
It's never gonna be the same
They say you got a broken heart
Some girls like to flirt and play
Some girls always get their way
Some boys never know why
Some girls like to scream and shout
Some girls put themselves about
Some boys never know why
In my mind you seem to be the perfect kind
How can I tell you I haven't really got the time
You wish I was ready I want you to wait
Listen to me boy before it gets too late
Some girls like to flirt and play
Some girls always get their way
Some boys never know why
Some girls like to scream and shout
Some girls put themselves about
Some boys never know why
Some girls scream and shout
Some girls flirt and play
Some girls always get their way

Last night I was dreaming
I was locked in a prison cell
And the judge and the jury
They wouldn't go for my story
They wouldn't hear my plea
Only you can set me free
Guilty as a girl can be
Of love in the first degree
You will come to my rescue
Unchain my heart you're keeping
The hours pass so slowly
Can't you see that I'm lonely
Won't you help me please
Only you can set me free
Guilty as a girl can be
Of love in the first degree
And the judge and the jury
They wouldn't go for my story
They wouldn't hear my plea
Only you can set me free
Guilty as a girl can be
Of love in the first degree
Only you can set me free
Guilty as a girl can be
Of love in the first degree
Only you can set me free
Guilty as a girl can be
I never gave up searching
For someone to take my loneliness away
And wash away my hurting
And then you turned my fantasy
Once in a lifetime comes a lover
All you're looking for
Maybe I've found my perfect lover
I've waited so long for someone like you
And even though the world can be so cold
I never gave up hoping
I'm waiting for the story to unfold
And there's no way of knowing
That the love you're looking for
Won't come too easily
Or maybe you're too blind to see
Once in a lifetime comes a lover
All you're looking for
Maybe I've found my perfect lover
I've waited so long for someone like you
I've waited so long for someone like you
That the love you're looking for
Won't come too easily
Or maybe you're too blind to see
Once in a lifetime comes a lover
All you're looking for
Maybe I've found my perfect lover
Whoever said the best things are free
Let me tell you it don't come easy
Life's a game but I still believe
You have to take it seriously
The world tells so many lies
And you can never stop
You gotta keep on climbing till you reach the top
You gotta keep on going till you strike it rich
Don't let them tell ya you ain't got a soul
Only sinners cast the first stone
And even if the sidewalk ain't gold
Anyone can be bought and sold
The world tells so many lies
And you can never stop
You gotta keep on climbing till you reach the top
You gotta keep on going till you strike it rich
Don't let them tell ya you ain't got a soul
Only sinners cast the first stone
Life's a game but I still believe
You have to take it seriously
The world tells so many lies
And you can never stop
You gotta keep on climbing till you reach the top
You gotta keep on going till you strike it rich
And you can never stop
You gotta keep on climbing till you reach the top
You gotta keep on going till you strike it rich
And you can never stop
You gotta keep on climbing till you reach the top
You gotta keep on going till you strike it rich
You gotta take control
And you can never stop
You gotta keep on climbing till you reach the top
It's something wonderful
When he makes love to me
He's everything I ever need
They can't understand
He's so different when we're on our own
He has all the things I can't do without
No matter what you say to me
He will always be my love energy
When he's standing close
All the things he doesn't do for me
Don't need anything better in my life
Than my baby when he's holding me
He will always be my love energy
He has all the things I can't do without
No matter what you say to me
He will always be my love energy
I haven't heard from you in a week
I thought that we had something special
Come back my love to my heart
And finish what you started
Who's that knocking on my door
Could it be you coming back for more
Can I trust you to be true this time
Do you need some help in making up your mind
You leave me wanting this love that we share
So stop all this pretending that you don't care
Come back with my heart
Baby stay with me and finish what you started
Come back my love to my heart
You'll never get away until you finish what you started
When conversation turns to new romance
All you ever want to do is dance
I need a lover who can give and take
Someone who'll never make my heart break
Love is forever to always be there
So stop your running round and baby play fair
Come back with my heart
Baby stay with me and finish what you started
Come back my love to my heart
You'll never get away until you finish what you started
Baby please don't make me wait
You leave me wanting this love that we share
So stop your running round and baby play fair
Come back with my heart
Baby stay with me and finish what you started
Come back my love to my heart
You packed your bags as I recall
And you walked slowly down the hall
You said you had to get away to ease your mind
And all you needed was a just little of time
Nathan Jones you've been gone too long
If a woman could die of tears
The key that you're holding won't fit my door
And there's no room in my heart for you no more
Nathan Jones you've been gone too long
Nathan Jones you've been gone too long
Nathan Jones you've been gone too long
Nathan Jones you've been gone too long
The room has suddenly grown cold
And outside in the street it's raining
You packed your bags and said goodbye
You took my heart without explaining
We had a love most people never know
Ooh stop before you break my heart
I want you back back back
I want you back back back
If I can make you see
Only you can fill the need in me
You'll regret it some day
This room is full of memories and
Shadows of the past remind me
Of all the love I gave in vain and
All the hurt I feel inside me
We had a love most people never know
Ooh stop before you break my heart
I want you back back back
I want you back back back
If I can make you see
Only you can fill the need in me
You'll regret it some day
We had a love most people never know
Ooh stop before you break my heart
I want you back back back
I want you back back back
If I can make you see
Only you can fill the need in me
You'll regret it some day
I want you back back back
He's just a sleaze machine
He's not here to please
He's only here to tease
He may look cute but he's unclean
And you don't know where he's been
He'll bring you to your knees
He's just a sleaze machine
He's just a sleaze machine
He's not here to please
He's only here to tease
He may look cute but he's unclean
And you don't know where he's been
He'll bring you to your knees
He's just a sleaze machine
You packed your bags as I recall

Nathan Jones you've been gone too long
Whatever lies out of reach of me
Can't obliterate the need
You're bad news disguised
Dressed and painted with lies
When truth is concealed
How the danger appeals
But my conscience sees
I heard it from the preacher man
He said leave that boy alone
I heard it from the preacher man
He said heaven must have sent you
But the devil's gonna get you
He's gonna do it for you
You're like a black cat
Who always knows that
It's life is a mystery
And then you hypnotize me
Till obsession devours me
You're silky words soothe me
And just as I'm falling
I hear a voice calling
I heard it from the preacher man
He said leave that boy alone
I heard it from the preacher man
He said heaven must have sent you
But the devil's gonna get you
He's gonna do it for you
You're bad news disguised
Dressed and painted with lies
When truth is concealed
How the danger appeals
But my conscience sees
I heard it from the preacher man
He said leave that boy alone
I heard it from the preacher man
He said heaven must have sent you
But the devil's gonna get you
Down around the corner
Half a mile from here
See them long trains run
And you watch them disappear
You know I saw miss Lucy
Down along the tracks
She lost her home and her family
And she won't be coming back
On the southern central freight
Gotta keep on pushing mama
You know they're running late
Well the pistons keep on turning
And the wheels go round and round
And the steel rails are cold and hard
For the miles that they go down
Baby baby baby baby babe
Oh won't you move it down
I gotta keep on moving
I can do anything I want to
For you I'd lay down my life
You know I need somebody
No one has to feel alone
We all need some love
You know I need your love
To break these chains around my soul
That burns in your name
Got to got to got to believe it
Come on and shine your light on me
You know I need somebody
No one has to feel alone
We all need some love
You know I need your love
To break these chains around my soul
You know I need somebody
No one has to feel alone
We all need some love
You know I need your love
To break these chains around my soul
It seems forever since you went away
I keep on hoping that the sun will shine
And the pain I feel will fade away with time
I sit and wonder how do you sleep
And if my heart you still keep
I hope in time you can forgive
If I had wings I'd fly to you
I shot the arrow straight through your heart
But I didn't mean for us to part
Thought it was greener on the other side
I watch the sun set deepest red
And still remember the things we said
If I had wings I'd fly to you
I sit and wonder how do you sleep
And if my heart you still keep
I hope in time you can forgive
If I had wings I'd fly to you
Let me take you on a trip with me
Where the winds of change are bittersweet
Only the strongest will succeed
Destiny has her eye on you
Surely the hand of fate will pull you through
Strong enough when things get rough for you
Strong enough for you to make it through
Still waters they run so deep
And good intentions are hard to keep
When jealous voices are all around
Without a care they drag you down down down
Into the dark out of the blue
Heaven is smiling down on you
Strong enough when things get rough for you
Strong enough for you to make it through
Strong enough when things get rough for you
Strong enough for you to make it through
Strong enough when things get rough for you
Strong enough for you to make it through
Strong enough when things get rough for you
Strong enough for you to make it through
Strong enough when things get rough for you
Strong enough for you to make it through
Strong enough for you to make it through
Looked up to see your face was
The sunlight crept through
Painting my room and I just
Don't you stop loving
Tripping on your love
Don't you stop loving
Tripping on your love
Straight out of the blue
Drowning in you it's such a
Sweet sensation and I'm
This heavenly love and through my
Don't you stop loving
Tripping on your love
Don't you stop loving
Tripping on your love
Dance on the mike one day with this drama
Don't you stop loving
Tripping on your love
Don't you stop loving
Tripping on your love
Don't you stop loving
Tripping on your love
Don't you stop loving
Tripping on your love
Don't you stop loving
Only the names have been changed
When he broke your heart you said
You'll never love again
But you'll be back for more
There ain't no remedy
It's the same as it ever was
Learning to love again
Is half the battle won
There ain't no remedy
It's the same as it ever was
There ain't no remedy
It's the same as it ever was
But you'll be back for more
There ain't no remedy
Good morning happy dreamer
And tell me how are you
My car's parked out on the driveway
Are you free this afternoon
So I'll drop by would that be cool
Makes me feel all right
I don't believe in wasting my time
This dream machine was built to last
So cruise on down my main street
And polish up your engine
We're heading for overdrive
Makes me feel all right
My car's parked out on the driveway
Are you free this afternoon
So I'll drop by would that be cool
Makes me feel all right
Money money money money
Money money money money
Watch his fingers snap
Feels like I've been sleeping
Secrets I've been keeping
Fill an ocean with tears
But I've found the answer
To what I'm searching for
Until you touched my soul
I want you for all time
Filled with such confusion
Fell for love's illusion
Any my life without you
Sends a chill right through my heart
But you made love easy
I want you for all time
I want you for all time
But I've found the answer
To what I'm searching for
Until you touched my soul
I want you for all time
Your love is too cold to handle
When I try to talk it over
You always close your eyes
How can I ever love you
When you won't let me through to you
How could you be so heartless
I can't believe anybody could be
You never show your feelings
Just look the other way
When I try to show affection
How long must you keep me waiting
Maybe you'll never change
How could you be so heartless
I can't believe anybody could be
I can't believe anybody could be
I can't believe anybody could be
How can I ever love you
When you won't let me through to you
How could you be so heartless
I can't believe anybody could be
How could you be so heartless
I can't believe anybody could be
Whatever lies out of reach of me
Can't obliterate the need
You're bad news disguised
Dressed and painted with lies
When truth is concealed
How the danger appeals
But my conscience sees
I heard it from the preacher man
He said leave that boy alone
I heard it from the preacher man
He said heaven must have sent you
But the devil's gonna get you
He's gonna do it for you
You're like a black cat
Who always knows that
It's life is a mystery
And then you hypnotize me
Till obsession devours me
You're silky words soothe me
And just as I'm falling
I hear a voice calling
I heard it from the preacher man
He said leave that boy alone
I heard it from the preacher man
He said heaven must have sent you
But the devil's gonna get you
He's gonna do it for you
You're bad news disguised
Dressed and painted with lies
When truth is concealed
How the danger appeals
But my conscience sees
I heard it from the preacher man
He said leave that boy alone
I heard it from the preacher man
He said heaven must have sent you
But the devil's gonna get you
You know I'll miss you
Our love started to go wrong
I know we planned to stay together
We just ran into stormy weather
We couldn't see the dark clouds in the sky
But I had no way of knowing
And I don't know where I'm going
But the writing's on the wall
And now the sun has finally set and
This is where the story ends we
Didn't count upon a rainy day
But I had no way of knowing
And I don't know where I'm going
But I had no way of knowing
And I don't know where I'm going
I know we planned to stay together
We just ran into stormy weather
We couldn't see the dark clouds in the sky
But I had no way of knowing
And I don't know where I'm going
But I had no way of knowing
And I don't know where I'm going
But I had no way of knowing
And I don't know where I'm going
There was something in your voice
That was telling me don't be too sure
Arousing my suspicions
I have never felt before
I thought we had it made
I thought you'd never go away
But now you're suddenly like a stranger
And you're leaving our love behind
Of all the things I was ever planning for
This was the last thing on my mind
When I looked into your eyes
There was something you weren't telling me
If there was any doubt
I thought that we would work it out
But now you're suddenly like a stranger
And you're leaving our love behind
Of all the things I was ever planning for
This was the last thing on my mind
This was the last thing on my mind
There was something in your voice
That was telling me don't be too sure
Arousing my suspicions
I have never felt before
I thought we had it made
I thought you'd never go away
But now you're suddenly like a stranger
And you're leaving our love behind
Of all the things I was ever planning for
I never meant to hurt you
Didn't mean to do you wrong
I guess I never learned to
And then by chance to meet you
Bringing back the memories
Could you ever come on back to me
I know that we can make it
Let me love you one more time
One more chance to make it right
I could make you change your mind
Let me love you one more time
We've been apart for much too long
How my heart still beats for you
I know that we can make it
Let me love you one more time
One more chance to make it right
I could make you change your mind
Let me love you one more time
Let me love you one more time
One more chance to make it right
I could make you change your mind
Let me love you one more time
I know that we can make it
Let me love you one more time
One more chance to make it right
I could make you change your mind
But if you want to know
Just get the cameras rolling
Baby you know my love for you is real
Take me where you want to
Then my heart you'll steal
And if you want to know
Just hear the rhythm grooving
Baby you know my love for you is true
Baby you know my love for you is real
Take me where you want to
Then my heart you steal
I've seen you out and about
Doing the things we used to do
And I've seen you looking at her
The same way I always looked at you
And I know your happy now
And I hope you'll never find
That you've got a broken heart
The way you broke mine
Now that we're through
Does she give you her time
Can she love you like I do
Does she thrill you through and through
I can't believe you would go
Leaving me here after all that we said
And how much it hurts me to know
That you're lying in somebody else's bed
And when I close my eyes
You're the only thing I see
So if she hurts you boy
You can come back to me
Now that we're through
Does she give you her time
Can she love you like I do
Does she thrill you through and through
But you've got a broken heart
The way you broke mine
Now that we're through
Does she give you her time
Can she love you like I do
Does she thrill you through and through
Was it written in the stars
How I feel it in my heart
All my senses are colliding
Feelings running round inside me
Or will our love drift away on the breeze
Or will love become a memory
Since the day we fell
We knew the story well
Could this be my destiny
When you're lying next to me
May I never watch our love go
Disappearing into shadow
Or will our love drift away on the breeze
Or will love become a memory
Since the day we fell
We knew the story well
Or will love become a memory
Since the day we fell
We knew the story well
Feelings running round inside me
Or will our love drift away on the breeze
Or will love become a memory
Since the day we fell
We knew the story well
To all the men I knew before
Old love letters in the drawer
Mean nothing to me no more
Everything that I possessed
Brought me joy and happiness
And everything I worked for
I don't need my photographs
No reminders of the past
Next to you there's no contest
Parties and the shallow friends
Social whirl that never ends
What life had in store for me
What does it all mean
None of this was ever planned
But now fate has played her hand
Now I've got you in my life
You're everything I need and more
Parties and the shallow friends
The social whirl that never ends
I don't need my photographs
No reminders of the past
Next to you there's no contest
Parties and the shallow friends
Social whirl that never ends
When you can't face another day
Don't you ever stop and wonder
Why it's all work and there's no play
Why do you let them drag you under
Do you wanna hear how it should be
Face the world don't hide behind it
You've only got yourself to please
Happiness is where you find it
Until you set yourself free
You'll never hold on to your dreams
Until you get your release
You'll never know what it means
You'll never know what it means
So you had a sleepless night
Been so long you can't remember
Since you had a real good time
You can't go on like this forever
Until you set yourself free
You'll never hold on to your dreams
Until you get your release
You'll never know what it means
You'll never know what it means
You'll never know what it means
Do you wanna hear how it should be
Face the world don't hide behind it
You've only got yourself to please
Happiness is where you find it
Until you set yourself free
You'll never hold on to your dreams
Until you get your release
You'll never know what it means
You'll never know what it means
You'll never know what it means
Until you set yourself free
You'll never hold on to your dreams
Until you get your release
You'll never know what it means
I gave you everything but you still want more
You just don't know what you're looking for
You used to say I was all you ever need
But now you're running round footloose and free
You choose to play the other side of the tracks
Then expecting me to take you back
You never know what's good for you
You want your cake and eat it too
Saying the grass is greener on the other side
You can look but you'll never find
Don't you know you're never satisfied
If you play with fire you'd better learn
You fool around you get your fingers burned
Out of mind is out of sight
Don't know how you sleep at night
Saying the grass is greener on the other side
You can look but you'll never find
You're never satisfied
Don't know how you sleep at night
You want your cake and eat it too
You choose to play the other side of the tracks
Then expecting me to take you back
You never know what's good for you
You want your cake and eat it too
Saying the grass is greener on the other side
You can look but you'll never find
And it's cold outside
I wonder should I wait
Or should I say goodbye
If I should be staying
But here in your arms
Ooh it feels so right
And lose track of time
If I should be staying
But here in your arms
But I just don't know
If I should be staying
But here in your arms
When you just don't care
You think you're fine
You're just like the rest
Find yourself another lover
You're just a typical male
There's another shoulder you can cry on
Another bed for you to lie on
Just find another lover
You've had your chance
Find yourself another lover
You're just a typical male
There's another shoulder you can cry on
Another bed for you to lie on
Just find another lover
Find yourself another lover
You're just a typical male
There's a big wide world of love for taking
Other hearts you could be breaking
Just find another lover
Find yourself another lover
Find yourself another lover
You think you're fine
You're just like the rest
Find yourself another lover
You're just a typical male
There's another shoulder you can cry on
Another bed for you to lie on
Just find another lover
Find yourself another lover
You're just a typical male
There's a big wide world of love for taking
Other hearts you could be breaking
Treat me right and please me
Treat me right and please me
Treat me right and please me
Treat me right and please me
Treat me right and please me
Treat me right and please me
I have the saddest feeling
Don't think that I will hear
Now the moon lights up
I know the stars will shine
The way I feel inside
Every shade of blue I see
When you're away from me
Thinking about you oh oh thinking about you
Every shade of blue I cry
When I'm without you oh oh when I'm without you
Alone in the darkness
But always the daylight
Comes around too soon
And the night goes on
Feels like it never ends
Till you come back again
And the night goes on
Feels like it never ends
Get down to the rhythm
Down to the rhythm of life
Get down to the rhythm
You know you can do it
It's the rhythm of life
Better get yourself together
Gotta make you're mind up soon
Now that time is running out on you
I'll be right behind you
I can catch you when you fall
Get down to the rhythm
Down to the rhythm of life
Get down to the rhythm
You know you can do it
It's the rhythm of life
If you're feeling lost and lonely
You know I can ease your pain
Never have to be that way again
Just believe you can make it
The chance is there so take it
So don't let it pass you by
Get down to the rhythm
Down to the rhythm of life
Get down to the rhythm
You know you can do it
It's the rhythm of life
Get down to the rhythm
Get down to the rhythm
Get down to the rhythm
Get down to the rhythm
Get down to the rhythm
Down to the rhythm of life
Get down to the rhythm
You know you can do it
I can't stop thinking about you
Take me to your heart
And my heart can't fight the feeling
I just knew what I'm missing
So how much time will it take
Till we get to that day
Heaven could be waiting
I can't stop thinking about you
Take me to your heart
Baby when you hold me
You really got me going
You really move me baby
So how much time will it take
Till we get to that day
Heaven could be waiting
I can't stop thinking about you
Take me to your heart
So how much time will it take
Till we get to that day
Heaven could be waiting
I can't stop thinking about you
Take me to your heart
Come on and make it happen
Show a little passion
Come on and make it happen
Show a little passion
How did it get to this
I've fallen under your kiss
Tell me what is on your mind
Maybe tonight we'll find
Come on and make it happen
Show a little passion
Some things were meant to be
Like you were meant for me
Why don't you make your move
I'll leave it up to you
Come on and make it happen
Show a little passion
Come on and make it happen
Show a little passion
Come on and make it happen
Show a little passion
Come on and make it happen
All the things that we have ever wanted to
Feels like I've been sleeping for a million years
Now your kiss is breathing life back into me
Why worry about the world outside
We've got everything we need
All the things that we have ever wanted to
How can I love you more
Heaven knows that you're the one I've waited for
Hold my hand and baby we can disappear
Why worry about the world outside
We've got everything we need
All the things that we have ever wanted to
Why worry about the world outside
We've got everything we need
All the things that we have ever wanted to
All the things that we have ever wanted to
In my blood in my veins
Trying to hide from me
Ain't no stopping me now
I'm gonna fly so free
The shadows on the wall
I'm thinking of you now
In my blood in my veins
I can't stop thinking about you
In my blood in my veins
The shadows on the wall
I'm thinking of you now
In my blood in my veins
You're my joy you're my pain
In my blood in my veins
In my blood in my veins
Your touch is so exciting
I feel the passion rising
I just can't seem to stop it
Anyway or how you want it
Now nothing can stop me
You're like a fantasy
Doing what you're doing to me
No one has ever moved me
Oh what you doing to me
Now nothing can stop me
Now nothing can stop me
Your touch is so exciting
I feel the passion rising
I just can't seem to stop it
Anyway or how you want it
Now nothing can stop me
You really got something
I remember how I once said
Don't let the guy go to your head
I was always the cautious one
Looking out for trouble
Since you came my way
You really got something
You really do move me
I remember my own advice
Keep on moving and don't think twice
My friends tell me I've changed my tune
Guess its down to you
Since you've been around
You really got something
You really do move me
You really got something
You really do move me
You really got something
You really got something
I remember how I once said
Don't let the guy go to your head
I was always the cautious one
Looking out for trouble
Since you came my way
You really got something
You really do move me
I'm taking time out in the name of love
Well I know when I've had enough
Till you see things straight
Don't let me walk away
How come whenever we're together
It's a shame it seems to be
Waste of time for you and me
But I just can't stand to see us end this way
I'm taking time out in the name of love
Well I know when I've had enough
Till you see things straight
Don't let me walk away
You say there's nothing here worth keeping
So just close the door and I'll watch you leaving
Saying everything is fine
Still I just don't want to hear us say goodbye
I'm taking time out in the name of love
Till you see things straight
Don't let me walk away
I'm taking time out in the name of love
It's a shame it seems to be
Waste of time for you and me
But I just can't stand to see us end this way
I'm taking time out in the name of love
Well I know when I've had enough
Till you see things straight
Don't let me walk away
I'm taking time out in the name of love
Well I know when I've had enough
Till you see things straight
About the company you keep
Didn't want to believe it
But you been talking in your sleep
Now I know the reason
I heard you call her name
Well you made your bed
Don't you try to stop me now
Don't you say you love me now
I don't wanna talk no more
Do I have to spell it out
Don't you know I've caught you out
But you won't see me anymore
Boy you're really something
Thought you had it made
Well I'm here to tell you
You've made a big mistake
Now I know the answer
So hear me when I say
Well you've had your fun
Don't you try to stop me now
Don't you say you love me now

Do I have to spell it out

But you won't see me anymore
Now I know the reason
I heard you call her name

Secrets we'll share with each other
These moments we should keep
Locked forever in our sleep
Nothing here but me and you
I'll show you the morning
These moments we should keep
Locked forever in our sleep
Nothing here but me and you
These moments we should keep
Locked forever in our sleep
Nothing here but me and you
Had this feeling lately
I just can't get you off my mind
Make me lose all sense of time
When you hold me baby
You turn my world upside down yeah
When you touch me oh baby
My feet don't even touch the ground
I've got a lover who gives me more
The kind of love I've never found before
Am I going much too fast
But something tells me oh baby
I've got a love that's gonna last
You make me feel so good inside
I can love you completely
This time I know I've got it right
I've got a lover who gives me more
The kind of love I've never found before
I've got a lover who gives me more
The kind of love I've never found before
I'll tell you what you want to know
I could have saved a broken heart
If I'd found out long ago
I'm just thinking about
When I waited for your call
All my friends were right
I didn't know you at all
They say you got a broken heart
Now it seems they're telling me
You've changed your wicked ways
But should I give you a second chance
And the love you threw away
How can I forgive or soon forget
It's never gonna be the same
They say you got a broken heart
Sugar's sweet but your kisses can't be beat
I'm hungry for your sweet love
I need you here tonight
I'm captivated by your honey
I'm captivated by your honey
Whatever you need from me gonna let you get your way
So move your body close
I'm captivated by your honey
I'm captivated by your honey
Move your body close tonight
Move your body close tonight
Move your body close tonight
Move your body close tonight
I'm hungry for your sweet love
I need you here tonight
I'm crazy I'm burning up
I'm captivated by your honey
You know I'll miss you
Our love started to go wrong

And you're leaving our love behind
Of all the things I was ever planning for
Hopes dashed to the floor
Like shattered teenage dreams
Boys living next door
A walk in the park can become a bad dream
People are staring and following me
This is my only escape from it all
Watching a film or a face on the wall
I've got a man of steel
Don't come any closer
I never want this to happen to me
Now I've got something much better in mind
A walk in the park can become a bad dream
People are staring and following me
This is my only escape from it all
Watching a film or a face on the wall
The sun shines forever
Through a child's eyes
The sun shines forever
Laughing and learning
I never believed that I'd grow old
Still I can hear the things you told
The sun has gone and the nights are cold
I sit and watch the sunset
With tears in my eyes
I sit and watch the sunset
The child in me sighs
I never believed that I'd grow old
Still I can hear the things you told
The sun has gone and the nights are cold
Old before their time
It was there only crime
How come I love them now
How come I love them more
But all I wanted to do when I was
Old was to walk out the door
I shouldn't have known at all
How come I love them now
How come I love them more
But all I wanted to do when I was
Old was to walk out the door
Who's right who's wrong
Two brothers two more hearts
Too hard to take it all
How come I love them now
How come I love them more
But all I wanted to do when I was
Think of me while you're walking down the street
Scheming ways for us to meet
I know that you'd like to fool around
You know I'm the hottest thing in town
You're getting closer
I'm the queen bee baby
So you just can't fail
I'm your sweet thing baby
You're always worried that I'm not gonna stay
Haunting you every day and night
Haunting you till the early morning light
And you want me if you know what's right
You're getting closer
I'm the queen bee baby
So you just can't fail
I'm your sweet thing baby
You're always worried that I'm not gonna stay
You're always worried that I'll split the scene
I can read from your eyes that you like my style
Imagination's really running wild
If you give it a try you know it could be
So come on little baby won't you follow me
I'm your sweet thing baby
You're always worried that I'm not gonna stay
You're always worried that I'll split the scene
Or must we still pretend
That we're really friends
Those feelings have gone
But we're not the same
And we're both to blame
There's nothing left to tell you
Nothing left to give you
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
You walk out when I walk in
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
Can't you see the state I'm in
Now the time has come
To leave the past behind
And I've made up my mind
Look at what we've done
Who needs to be ashamed
I've built my world around you
I'm better off without you
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
You walk out when I walk in
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
Can't you see the state I'm in
There's nothing left to tell you
Nothing left to give you
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
You walk out when I walk in
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
It's a matter of fact
I got what you want so don't go back
So come and get it let's have some fun
I wanna show you you're the only one
Deep down down inside
It's a matter of fact
This is more than physical
I've been watching you
Come on and show me what you can do
You've got what I want stop wasting time
You're sending shivers up and down my spine
Deep down down inside
It's a matter of fact
This is more than physical
This is more than physical
This is more than physical
Deep down down inside
It's a matter of fact
This is more than physical
If you feel that something missing
Made of push turns to shove
You feel that something lacking
When the going gets tough
I'm not asking anything
Just some love in return
I'm the one you need for sure
Hear the siren coming down the street
And my healing powers
From your head down to your feet
If you feel that something missing
In your dreams at night
May need my medical science
To put you back right
When the going gets tough
I'm not asking anything
Just some love in return
I'm the one you need for sure
Hear the siren coming down the street
And my healing powers
Well that's all right with me
Well your dreams won't last forever
And that's how it should be
I'm only living for your pleasure
True confessions can reveal
False impressions disappear
True confessions you come back
These obsessions of your mind
If I lead you to the water
Emotions that you torture
True confessions can reveal
False impressions disappear
True confessions you come back
These obsessions of your mind
True confessions can reveal
False impressions disappear
True confessions you come back
These obsessions of your mind
These obsessions of your mind
Feels like I've been sleeping
Secrets I've been keeping
Fill an ocean with tears
But I've found the answer
To what I'm searching for
Until you touched my soul
I want you for all time
Filled with such confusion
Fell for love's illusion
Any my life without you
Sends a chill right through my heart
But you made love easy
I want you for all time
I want you for all time
But I've found the answer
To what I'm searching for
Until you touched my soul
I want you for all time
Good morning happy dreamer
And tell me how are you
My car's parked out on the driveway
Are you free this afternoon
So I'll drop by would that be cool
Makes me feel all right
I don't believe in wasting my time
This dream machine was built to last
So cruise on down my main street
And polish up your engine
We're heading for overdrive
Makes me feel all right
My car's parked out on the driveway
Are you free this afternoon
So I'll drop by would that be cool
Makes me feel all right
Give me what I'm waiting for
Come on come on encore
A kiss out of the blue
A kiss out of the blue
When you know the truth
You can try to resist me but you're gonna lose
We can make this real
All you gotta do is just do as you feel
Give me what I'm waiting for
Come on come on encore
A kiss out of the blue
A kiss out of the blue
A kiss out of the blue
I see the stars in your eyes
Where our universe collides
Take me through the night
Standing there in front of me there's nothing I can say
Cause boy you really take my breath away
No denying I'm in heaven when you look my way
And you can't hide it's written on your face
Take me far away it's where I want to be
Together for eternity
I see the stars in your eyes
Where our universe collides
Take me through the night
So let our bodies move in time
The moon and stars are all in line
You're the one I've waited for
Don't have to search no more
Golden rays shine through the haze and touch us where we lay
Destiny has handed me my fate
So lay your head up on my pillow and watch the angels play
Close your eyes and we can drift away
Our bodies will entwine
I love you till the end of time
I see the stars in your eyes
Where our universe collides
Take me through the night
So let our bodies move in time
The moon and stars are all in line
You're the one I've waited for
Warm expression fills up all this space
True reflections of your world in me
Deep inside I know I found your key
It's all there in your eyes
What you gonna do with the good times
What you gonna do with this game
What you gonna do there's no holding back
Cause love won't wait
When you wanna love just call me
It is always the same
What you gonna do when the love runs out
So if we're falling can I turn your key
Pure emotion wells up inside of me
There are things in us we must keep
Will you confess to me
We are lost in each others eyes
What you gonna do with the good times
What you gonna do with this game
What you gonna do there's no holding back
Cause love won't wait
When you wanna love just call me
It is always the same
What you gonna do when the love runs out
What you gonna do with the good times
What you gonna do with this game
What you gonna do there's no holding back
Cause love won't wait
When you wanna love just call me
It is always the same
What you gonna do when the love runs out
What you gonna do with the good times
What you gonna do with this game
What you gonna do there's no holding back
Cause love won't wait
When you wanna love just call me
It is always the same
What you gonna do when the love runs out
And the pavements are burning
But the air is so heavy and dry
Strange voices are saying
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort
This heat has got right out of hand
Leaving me here on my own
It's too hot to handle
So I got to get up and go
Leaving me here on my own
You're not the only one
Leaving me here on my own
Leaving me here on my own
You're not the only one
Leaving me here on my own
You're not the only one
Leaving me here on my own
You tell me you made a mistake
So you're back to bother me
You think that you're just what I need
Well baby let me tell you that you're wrong
Baby don't you treat me this way
I'm sick and tired of you
And everything that you say
And everything you do
I need a lover who treats me right
Not one who's cold as ice
Baby it's time to move on
You think that I still want you but you're wrong
Baby don't you treat me this way
I'm sick and tired of you
And everything that you say
And everything you do
Baby don't you treat me this way
I'm sick and tired of you
And everything that you say
And everything you do
Must be mad to think I believe you now
Don't come back I don't wanna see you now
Baby don't you treat me this way
I'm sick and tired of you
And everything that you say
And everything you do
Baby don't you treat me this way
I'm sick and tired of you
And everything that you say
And everything you do
Need to see a little more attitude
Need to see a little more attitude
Do you like the way I feel
Tell me if I let you in
Will you try and control me
And show you where you started from
And start this ride all over again
Lucky number seven's there for you
It's gonna be the best thing that you ever do
Do you like the way I feel
Tell me if I let you in
Will you try and control me
And show you where you started from
And start this ride all over again
Show you where you started from
Show you where you started from
And show you where you started from
Hopes dashed to the floor
Like shattered teenage dreams
Boys living next door
A walk in the park can become a bad dream
People are staring and following me
This is my only escape from it all
Watching a film or a face on the wall
I've got a man of steel
Don't come any closer
I never want this to happen to me
Now I've got something much better in mind
A walk in the park can become a bad dream
People are staring and following me
This is my only escape from it all
Watching a film or a face on the wall
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
There's no comfort in the truth
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have danced this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Now I'm never gonna dance again
Now it's easy to pretend
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
Each time you laid with me
Falling from your lips
Don't tell me you made me
You played me for a fool
Lies come tumbling down now
I don't know why you broke my heart
Just send me to sleep
This is happening to me
Just send me to sleep
You played your game with me
No words are left to speak
I'm left standing in the rain
Just send me to sleep
This is happening to me
Just send me to sleep
Just send me to sleep
This is happening to me
Just send me to sleep
Just send me to sleep
This is happening to me
Just send me to sleep
I'll tell you what you want to know
I could have saved a broken heart
If I'd found out long ago
I'm just thinking about
When I waited for your call
All my friends were right
I didn't know you at all
They say you got a broken heart
Now it seems they're telling me
You've changed your wicked ways
But should I give you a second chance
And the love you threw away
How can I forgive or soon forget
It's never gonna be the same
They say you got a broken heart
Each time I close my eyes
You take up all my time
My every thoughts of you
Tell me can I get with you now baby
I just can't live without you
Tell me can I get with you now baby
I just can't live without you
Feel your body close to mine
Each time I close my eyes
I feel so good tonight
You make me want to cry
Tell me can I get with you now baby
I just can't live without you
I cannot stop from falling
I just can't live without you
Tell me can I get with you now baby
I just can't live without you
Tell me can I get with you now baby
Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name
Her weapons were her crystal eyes
Black as the dark night she was
Got what no one else had
Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Boy you make me nervous
Unknown pleasures crossing your mind
Know how much you want to
Take this fast love creeping up behind
But this moment might fade away
And it's making my heart ache
One step away from heaven
Feel your lips on mine
Nothing can come close to this
Right this way together for all time
Feelings take the surface
Midnight madness won't leave me alone
Touch me like an angel
Take me up to paradise
I'm not falling in love with you
I'm not scared to see it through
I'm so high above the clouds
I would give you everything
If you could only see
You dream a different dream
It was never meant to be
I'm so high above the clouds
I would give you everything
If I thought that you could see
I need to feel the love that wraps me up and keeps me warm
I can see everything from here tonight
And who knows my destiny up in the sky
I wanna see the 7 wonders of the world
I wanna see the heavens in your eyes
I feel you moving closer
The waiting will soon be over
Take me in you arms and take me
You woke me from my underworld of dream
Your salty waters takes me in so deep
Access of water as they're rushing over me
It takes me up to the land of make believe
I'm tripping solely over
You got me going crazy
I'm lost in your eyes
Take me in you arms and take me
I feel you moving closer
The waiting will soon be over
Take me in you arms and take me
Take me in you arms and take me
Feel the ties left tightly bound
All that's locked up in your mind
I'm gonna take my time
See how slowly you unwind
So come on feel you away
It's a dangerous game
But if you wanna play
You look so perfect lying there
It's more than I can bare
Wanna touch you everywhere
You give me what I need
You're my only desire
And I need to get high
You know what you do for me
You stopped my heart from beating
Every second I am dreaming
And together we'll get high
Into this world of mine
So won't you come inside of me
High on your blue skies
I'm sailing away on your oceans
Wanna touch you when you're sleeping
Let me feel you breathing
I'm gonna take you dipping
You're rushing through my mind
Your body moves in time with me
High on your blue skies
I'm sailing away on your oceans
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself
Promise to love you forever more
Couldn't escape if I wanted to
Knowing my fate is to be with you
Finally facing my Waterloo
And how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose
Promise to love you forever more
Couldn't escape if I wanted to
Knowing my fate is to be with you
Finally facing my Waterloo
And how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose
Couldn't escape if I wanted to
Knowing my fate is to be with you
Finally facing my Waterloo
Knowing my fate is to be with you
Is there something you wanna say
Cause it feels so strange
When you look at me that way
They only point one way
Don't let me hear you say
So tell me you want me the way I want you
Wanna feel your kiss upon my lips
This voice inside me says
Don't let me hear you say
So tell me you want me the way I want you
Who's walked down the mountain
They're afraid to fall
But with you I hear the music
Don't let me hear you say
I was walking down the street
When this boy started following me
Now I ignored all the things he said
He moved me in every way
He was really saying something
Really saying something
He flirted every step of the way
I could hear every word he'd say
My resistance was getting low
And my feelings started to show
My heart started thumping
Blood pressure jumping
He was really saying something
Really saying something
He walked me to my door
I agreed to see him once more
Lady like it may not be
But he moved me tremendously
He was really saying something
Really saying something
He used to be a shy boy
Until I made him my boy
I never missed a heartbeat
Just sitting in the back seat
I'm gonna give him all my love
One thing I know he's dreaming of
I wanna squeeze and hold him tight
But don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
Don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
Everything we put together
Seems to last forever
He knows about a good time
Gonna make him all mine
I like the way he turns me on
I wanna keep him all to myself
If my heart could beat that strong
But don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
Don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
I'm gonna give him all my love
One thing I know he's dreaming of
I wanna squeeze and hold him tight
But don't it make you
But don't it make you
I like the way he turns me on
I wanna keep him all to myself
If my heart could beat that strong
But don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
Don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
But don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
Don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
Hopes dashed to the floor
Like shattered teenage dreams

Leaving me here on my own
What your mother don't know
Her good advice was a waste of time
Make hay while the sun shines
No one there to say you're wrong or right
You've waited a lifetime
Burning all your bridges tonight
This is the wild life
This is the wild life
No stone left unturned
Jump in the fire you're gonna get burned
You might lose your way
When you come out to play
But I've seen and done
Everything that they say is fun
I gotta find out for myself
In the end there's no one else
Every time I try to win I lose
Now I'm gonna make my own rules
This is the wild life
This is the wild life
No stone left unturned
Jump in the fire you're gonna get burned
You might lose your way
When you come out to play
No one there to say you're wrong or right
You've waited a lifetime
Burning all your bridges tonight
This is the wild life
This is the wild life
No stone left unturned
Jump in the fire you're gonna get burned
You might lose your way

You've got what I want stop wasting time
You're sending shivers up and down my spine
Deep down down inside
It's a matter of fact
This is more than physical
This is more than physical
This is more than physical
Deep down down inside
It's a matter of fact
This is more than physical
Well it's a different story
As the darkness comes around
I tried to let you know
You're going the wrong way
And the streets you thought
Would all be paved with gold
But when the wind cuts through
You'd even try to sell your soul
Just the boy next door
When they were falling in love
With that clean cut smile
Just for a little while
Walking through danger
Can't see the wrong or the right
Must be a trick of the night
Well it's a laugh a minute
Between the burning question
And the fortune in his eyes
You never let it show
Or take it the wrong way
What you came here for
With those bare faced lies
All the hurt you're feeling inside
Walking through danger
Can't see the wrong or the right
Must be a trick of the night
Walking through danger
Can't see the wrong or the right
Must be a trick of the night
Must be a trick of the night
Well it's a different story
As the darkness comes around
And the streets you thought
Would all be paved with gold
But when the wind cuts through
I'll tell you what you want to know
I could have saved a broken heart
If I'd found out long ago
I'm just thinking about
When I waited for your call
All my friends were right
I didn't know you at all
They say you got a broken heart
Now it seems they're telling me
You've changed your wicked ways
But should I give you a second chance
And the love you threw away
How can I forgive or soon forget
It's never gonna be the same
They say you got a broken heart
Last night I was dreaming
I was locked in a prison cell
And the judge and the jury
They wouldn't go for my story
They wouldn't hear my plea
Only you can set me free
Guilty as a girl can be
Of love in the first degree
You will come to my rescue
Unchain my heart you're keeping
The hours pass so slowly
Can't you see that I'm lonely
Won't you help me please
Only you can set me free
Guilty as a girl can be
Of love in the first degree
And the judge and the jury
They wouldn't go for my story
They wouldn't hear my plea
Only you can set me free
Guilty as a girl can be
Of love in the first degree
Only you can set me free
Guilty as a girl can be
Of love in the first degree
Only you can set me free
Guilty as a girl can be
The way that I love you
Go on and kiss him goodbye
To comfort and cheer you
When all those sad tears
Go on and kiss him goodbye
I was walking down the street
When this boy started following me
Now I ignored all the things he said
He moved me in every way
He was really saying something
Really saying something
He flirted every step of the way

He was really saying something
Really saying something
He walked me to my door
I agreed to see him once more
Lady like it may not be
But he moved me tremendously
He was really saying something
Really saying something
Old before their time
It was there only crime
How come I love them now
How come I love them more
But all I wanted to do when I was
Old was to walk out the door
I shouldn't have known at all
How come I love them now
How come I love them more
But all I wanted to do when I was
Old was to walk out the door
Who's right who's wrong
Two brothers two more hearts
Too hard to take it all
How come I love them now
How come I love them more
But all I wanted to do when I was
You think it's all so easy
When you got your name in lights
Money comes in bag fulls
And you spend it every night
When you fly from place to place
Up at six each morning
Slapping make up on your face...
I wish you were in our shoes
I wish you could be us
Washing all your laundry
And riding on the bus
I wish you were in our shoes
I wish you could be us
Washing all your laundry
And riding on the bus
Speaks to you at noon
Never knowing you made them
Thinking they made you
Double trouble everywhere
I haven't slept a wink...
I wish you were in our shoes
I wish you could be us
Washing all your laundry
And riding on the bus
I wish you were in our shoes
I wish you could be us
Washing all your laundry
And riding on the bus
What a shambles of a meeting
Don't know what to say
What a shambles of a bus ride
What a shambles of a day...
I wish you were in our shoes
I wish you could be us
Washing all your laundry
Hopes dashed to the floor
Like shattered teenage dreams
Boys living next door
A walk in the park can become a bad dream
People are staring and following me
This is my only escape from it all
Watching a film or a face on the wall
I've got a man of steel
Don't come any closer
I never want this to happen to me
Now I've got something much better in mind
A walk in the park can become a bad dream
People are staring and following me
This is my only escape from it all
Watching a film or a face on the wall
Or must we still pretend
That we're really friends
Those feelings have gone
But we're not the same
And we're both to blame
There's nothing left to tell you
Nothing left to give you
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
You walk out when I walk in
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
Can't you see the state I'm in
Now the time has come
To leave the past behind
And I've made up my mind
Look at what we've done
Who needs to be ashamed
I've built my world around you
I'm better off without you
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
You walk out when I walk in
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
Can't you see the state I'm in
There's nothing left to tell you
Nothing left to give you
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
You walk out when I walk in
You walk out when I walk in
Can't you see the state I'm in
The young don't grow up
Well not in this life
While the sneaky and snide
Innocent people walking by
No time to smile before they die
Don't call that justice
Children are starving on the street
Another one disappearing every week
Don't call that justice
But their kingdom grows cold
They'll never grow up
But they're bound to grow old
And I'll show them rough justice
The way that they did
Innocent people walking by
No time to smile before they die
Don't call that justice
Children are starving on the street
Another one disappearing every week
Don't call that justice
Innocent people walking by
No time to smile before they die
Don't call that justice
Children are starving on the street
Another one disappearing every week
Don't call that justice
While the sneaky and snide
Innocent people walking by
No time to smile before they die
Don't call that justice
Children are starving on the street
Another one disappearing every week
Don't call that justice
Innocent people walking by
No time to smile before they die
Don't call that justice
Children are starving on the street
Another one disappearing every week
Don't call that justice
We took the late flight
Close to heaven in the cold half light
All the pleasures of that very first night
Crystal clear in my mind
Just another reservation
We found a room with a view
Lock the door and change the sign
Just you and me together
This night could last forever
When you read the sign
It's in black and white
In plain and simple terms
Where is the laughter
I know there must have been
Oh I don't wanna stay here with you
Now the sun won't shine
Seems to cloud our celebration
While I'm waiting all alone in my room
Trying to read between the lines
Now we're not together
This night could last forever
Now we're not together
This night could last forever
When you read the sign
It's in black and white
In plain and simple terms
When she walks down Main street
The cars slow down men turn around
While the other girls are left wondering why
Now give me one good reason
Why they just don't leave her alone
She won't stop or let you take a photograph
They might turn your head around
With good loving more or less
She don't need your good advice
We all need love I guess
She ain't a cut above the rest
She ain't a cut above the others
She ain't a cut above the others
She ain't a cut above the others
She ain't a cut above the others
No one takes the time out to try
She might look the part
But in her heart of hearts
Well she's really not so different inside
They might turn your head around
With good loving more or less
She don't need your good advice
We all need love I guess
She ain't a cut above the rest
She ain't a cut above the others
She ain't a cut above the others
She ain't a cut above the others
She ain't a cut above the others
They might turn your head around
With good loving more or less
She don't need your good advice
We all need love I guess
She ain't a cut above the rest
She ain't a cut above the others
She ain't a cut above the others
She ain't a cut above the others
Sugar's sweet but your kisses can't be beat
I'm hungry for your sweet love
I need you here tonight
I'm captivated by your honey
I'm captivated by your honey
Whatever you need from me gonna let you get your way
So move your body close
I'm captivated by your honey
I'm captivated by your honey
Move your body close tonight
Move your body close tonight
Move your body close tonight
Move your body close tonight
I'm hungry for your sweet love
I need you here tonight
I'm crazy I'm burning up
I'm captivated by your honey
I never gave up searching
For someone to take my loneliness away
And wash away my hurting
And then you turned my fantasy
Once in a lifetime comes a lover
All you're looking for
Maybe I've found my perfect lover
I've waited so long for someone like you
And even though the world can be so cold
I never gave up hoping
I'm waiting for the story to unfold
And there's no way of knowing
That the love you're looking for
Won't come too easily
Or maybe you're too blind to see
Once in a lifetime comes a lover
All you're looking for
Maybe I've found my perfect lover
I've waited so long for someone like you
I've waited so long for someone like you
That the love you're looking for
Won't come too easily
Or maybe you're too blind to see
Once in a lifetime comes a lover
All you're looking for
Maybe I've found my perfect lover
The room has suddenly grown cold
And outside in the street it's raining
You packed your bags and said goodbye
You took my heart without explaining
We had a love most people never know
Ooh stop before you break my heart
I want you back back back
I want you back back back
If I can make you see
Only you can fill the need in me
You'll regret it some day
This room is full of memories and
Shadows of the past remind me
Of all the love I gave in vain and
All the hurt I feel inside me
We had a love most people never know
Ooh stop before you break my heart
I want you back back back
I want you back back back
If I can make you see
Only you can fill the need in me
You'll regret it some day
We had a love most people never know
Ooh stop before you break my heart
I want you back back back
I want you back back back
If I can make you see
Only you can fill the need in me
You'll regret it some day
I want you back back back
And the pavements are burning
But the air is so heavy and dry
Strange voices are saying
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort
This heat has got right out of hand
Leaving me here on my own
It's too hot to handle
So I got to get up and go
You're not the only one
Who can I find while I'm trapped
Here inside these four walls
I can do anything I want to
For you I'd lay down my life
You know I need somebody
No one has to feel alone
We all need some love
You know I need your love
To break these chains around my soul
That burns in your name
Got to got to got to believe it
Come on and shine your light on me
You know I need somebody
No one has to feel alone
We all need some love
You know I need your love
To break these chains around my soul
You know I need somebody
No one has to feel alone
We all need some love
You know I need your love
To break these chains around my soul
Let me take you on a trip with me
Where the winds of change are bittersweet
Only the strongest will succeed
Destiny has her eye on you
Surely the hand of fate will pull you through
Strong enough when things get rough for you
Strong enough for you to make it through
Still waters they run so deep
And good intentions are hard to keep
When jealous voices are all around
Without a care they drag you down down down
Into the dark out of the blue
Heaven is smiling down on you
Strong enough when things get rough for you
Strong enough for you to make it through
Strong enough when things get rough for you
Strong enough for you to make it through
Strong enough when things get rough for you
Strong enough for you to make it through
Strong enough when things get rough for you
Strong enough for you to make it through
Strong enough when things get rough for you
Strong enough for you to make it through
Strong enough for you to make it through
Your love is too cold to handle
When I try to talk it over
You always close your eyes
How can I ever love you
When you won't let me through to you
How could you be so heartless
I can't believe anybody could be
You never show your feelings
Just look the other way
When I try to show affection
How long must you keep me waiting
Maybe you'll never change
How could you be so heartless
I can't believe anybody could be
I can't believe anybody could be
I can't believe anybody could be
How can I ever love you
When you won't let me through to you
How could you be so heartless
I can't believe anybody could be
How could you be so heartless
I can't believe anybody could be
But if you want to know
Just get the cameras rolling
Baby you know my love for you is real
Take me where you want to
Then my heart you'll steal
And if you want to know
Just hear the rhythm grooving
Baby you know my love for you is true
Baby you know my love for you is real
Take me where you want to
Then my heart you steal
Who needs friends who never show
I'll tell you what you want to know
I could have saved a broken heart
If I'd found out long ago
I'm just thinking about
When I waited for your call
All my friends were right
I didn't know you at all
They say you got a broken heart
They say you got a broken heart
Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name
Last night I was dreaming
I was locked in a prison cell
When I woke up I was screaming
And the judge and the jury
They wanna tell from my story
They want to hear my plea
Only you can set me free
Guilty as a girl can be
Come on baby can't you see
Of love in the first degree
Guilty of love in the first degree
Guilty of love in the first degree
Only you can set me free
Guilty as a girl can be
Come on baby can't you see
Of love in the first degree
Of love in the first degree
I'll tell you what you want to know
I could have saved a broken heart
If I'd found out long ago
I'm just thinking about
When I waited for your call
All my friends were right
I didn't know you at all
They say you got a broken heart
Now it seems they're telling me
You've changed your wicked ways
But should I give you a second chance
And the love you threw away
How can I forgive or soon forget
It's never gonna be the same
They say you got a broken heart
Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name
Her weapons were her crystal eyes
Black as the dark night she was
Got what no one else had
Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Last night I was dreaming
I was locked in a prison cell
And the judge and the jury
They wouldn't go for my story
They wouldn't hear my plea
Only you can set me free
Guilty as a girl can be
Of love in the first degree
You will come to my rescue
Unchain my heart you're keeping
The hours pass so slowly
Can't you see that I'm lonely
Won't you help me please
Only you can set me free
Guilty as a girl can be
Of love in the first degree
And the judge and the jury
They wouldn't go for my story
They wouldn't hear my plea
Only you can set me free
Guilty as a girl can be
Of love in the first degree
Only you can set me free
Guilty as a girl can be
Of love in the first degree
Only you can set me free
Guilty as a girl can be
It's been seven days since my last confession
And I really don't know where to begin
I should have called a taxi
Should have gone straight home
But we could just stay here and no one will know
Won't you move in my direction
Won't you move in my direction
Don't you know that you are my fascination
And I just can't wait to do it all again
I should have left the party
Should have left alone
Won't you move in my direction
Won't you move in my direction
I'll show you where to go
Won't you move in my direction
Why does wrong feel so right
Won't you move in my direction
Won't you move in my direction
I'll show you where to go
Won't you move in my direction
I'll show you where to go
Won't you move in my direction
It's close to midnight and I'm leaving now
I'm getting in my car and I'm heading out
And I can't slow down
You got my number so we'll be fine
And you know I'm right
And all is spinning round
Someone told me this was just a dance
And I'll give you more
Devil's in your eyes and he's looking at me
I know what you want and you know what I need
From your sweet mouth
Falling to the ground
It's like a waterfall coming down
Your love it just shiners through me like the sun
I can feel your touch
With me through the night
Come a little bit closer
Won't you whisper in my ear
Say the words I long to hear
Cause there's no question what's forbidden from my eyes
Tune into my frequency
Well there's something about you
When you love me like this
How very beautiful it is
It's me you're looking for
You can't deny it's me you're looking for
And I can't say no to you
And I can almost taste it
Don't keep me guessing
And I wanna dance with you
You know just what I'm gonna do with you
It's so electric here tonight
And so I'm heading out for the city life
I feel connected and it feels so right
Got no time to hesitate
If you're with me don't be late
Don't step on my groove
I don't care what you do
But don't step on my groove
Looking pretty and I'm running wild
There's nothing like it
When you lose your mind
The sun beats down on me
Mountains reach up to the sky
It's where I want to be
It's just an ordinary day
Nothing around obscures my view
I saw you standing there
I saw you standing there
I saw you standing there
I saw you standing there
I know it's a place for me
You said that you were going my way
But could you hit your ride
You took one look and had to smile
How could I pass you by
The way your hair falls on you face
But I was only passing through
I saw you standing there
I saw you standing there
I saw you standing there
I saw you standing there
I know it's a place for me
I saw you standing there
I know it's a place for me
I saw you standing there
I know it's a place for me
I saw you standing there
I saw you standing there
I saw you standing there
I saw you standing there
I know it's a place for me
I know it's a place for me
It's just an hour ago
I overheard your name
Feels like we've known each other for a lifetime
The stars will always shine
The sun will rise again
But for tonight we'll feel there's no tomorrow
I love the way you make me feel
Like dancing on the water
I love the way the two of us
Are more than one or other
And when you're holding me
Nowhere to draw the line
It's on a night like this you fall forever
I love the way you make me feel
Like dancing on the water
I love the way the two of us
Are more than one or other
I've got a secret I've got to keep
No turning back I'm in too deep
I knew you were trouble from the moment we met
Look in your eyes pushed me over the edge
And I can't hold back
Like a lightning strike through me and you
When love bites there's no place left to go
I can't fight this feeling in my soul
Never made a wish that never came true
Never took a chance till I met you
Love it can move in mysterious ways
Gets under your skin and it won't go away
Can nothing save me when love bites
Oh will I get through this
It's a perfect world wouldn't you say
Where the rules of attraction are very strange
The extraordinary games we play
Use it up and throw it away
A mixed girl hard to please
So I'll need your attention exclusively
Expectations are high obviously
But don't give up so easily
I can't believe the way that I feel
Whenever I'm with you
I wanna get next to you
Your love is like a drug
And every time you leave me wanting more
Your love is like a drug and everywhere you touch you never get enough
The thoughts that I have of you
You're on my mind day and night
And nobody else will do
Goddess on a mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
Summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name
Her weapons were her crystal eyes
Black as the dark night she was
Got what no one else had
Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name
I was walking down the street
When this boy started following me
Now I ignored all the things he said
He moved me in every way
He was really saying something
Really saying something
He flirted every step of the way
I could hear every word he'd say
My resistance was getting low
And my feelings started to show
He walked me to my door
I agreed to see him once more
Lady like it may not be
But he moved me tremendously
I was walking down the street
When this boy started following me
Now I ignored all the things he said
He moved me in every way
He was really saying something
Really saying something
He flirted every step of the way
I could hear every word he'd say
My resistance was getting low
And my feelings started to show
My heart started thumping
Blood pressure jumping
He was really saying something
Really saying something
He walked me to my door
I agreed to see him once more
Lady like it may not be
But he moved me tremendously
He was really saying something
Really saying something
He used to be a shy boy
Until I made him my boy
I never missed a heartbeat
Just sitting in the back seat
I'm gonna give him all my love
One thing I know he's dreaming of
I wanna squeeze and hold him tight
But don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
Don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
Everything we put together
Seems to last forever
He knows about a good time
Gonna make him all mine
I like the way he turns me on
I wanna keep him all to myself
If my heart could beat that strong
But don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
Don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
I'm gonna give him all my love
One thing I know he's dreaming of
I wanna squeeze and hold him tight
But don't it make you
But don't it make you
I like the way he turns me on
I wanna keep him all to myself
If my heart could beat that strong
But don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
Don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
But don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
Don't it make you feel good
And don't it make you feel good
And the pavements are burning
But the air is so heavy and dry
Strange voices are saying
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort
This heat has got right out of hand
Leaving me here on my own
It's too hot to handle
So I got to get up and go
Leaving me here on my own
You're not the only one
Leaving me here on my own
Leaving me here on my own
You're not the only one
Leaving me here on my own
You're not the only one
Leaving me here on my own
Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name
Her weapons were her crystal eyes
Black as the dark night she was
Got what no one else had
Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Yeah baby she's got it

Yeah baby she's got it
It's a matter of fact
I got what you want so don't go back
So come and get it let's have some fun
I wanna show you you're the only one
Deep down down inside
It's a matter of fact
This is more than physical
I've been watching you
Come on and show me what you can do
You've got what I want stop wasting time
You're sending shivers up and down my spine
Deep down down inside
It's a matter of fact
This is more than physical
This is more than physical
This is more than physical
Deep down down inside
It's a matter of fact
This is more than physical
Well it's a different story
As the darkness comes around
I tried to let you know
You're going the wrong way
And the streets you thought
Would all be paved with gold
But when the wind cuts through
You'd even try to sell your soul
Just the boy next door
When they were falling in love
With that clean cut smile
Just for a little while
Walking through danger
Can't see the wrong or the right
Must be a trick of the night
Well it's a laugh a minute
Between the burning question
And the fortune in his eyes
You never let it show
Or take it the wrong way
What you came here for
With those bare faced lies
All the hurt you're feeling inside
Walking through danger
Can't see the wrong or the right
Must be a trick of the night
Walking through danger
Can't see the wrong or the right
Must be a trick of the night
Must be a trick of the night
Well it's a different story
As the darkness comes around
And the streets you thought
Would all be paved with gold
But when the wind cuts through
I'll tell you what you want to know
I could have saved a broken heart
If I'd found out long ago
I'm just thinking about
When I waited for your call
All my friends were right
I didn't know you at all
They say you got a broken heart
Now it seems they're telling me
You've changed your wicked ways
But should I give you a second chance
And the love you threw away
How can I forgive or soon forget
It's never gonna be the same
They say you got a broken heart
You packed your bags as I recall
And you walked slowly down the hall
You said you had to get away to ease your mind
And all you needed was a just little of time
Nathan Jones you've been gone too long
If a woman could die of tears
The key that you're holding won't fit my door
And there's no room in my heart for you no more
Nathan Jones you've been gone too long
Nathan Jones you've been gone too long
Nathan Jones you've been gone too long
Nathan Jones you've been gone too long
I can do anything I want to
For you I'd lay down my life
You know I need somebody
No one has to feel alone
We all need some love
You know I need your love
To break these chains around my soul
That burns in your name
Got to got to got to believe it
Come on and shine your light on me
You know I need somebody
No one has to feel alone
We all need some love
You know I need your love
To break these chains around my soul
You know I need somebody
No one has to feel alone
We all need some love
You know I need your love
To break these chains around my soul
Whatever lies out of reach of me
Can't obliterate the need
You're bad news disguised
Dressed and painted with lies
When truth is concealed
How the danger appeals
But my conscience sees
I heard it from the preacher man
He said leave that boy alone
I heard it from the preacher man
He said heaven must have sent you
But the devil's gonna get you
He's gonna do it for you
You're like a black cat
Who always knows that
It's life is a mystery
And then you hypnotize me
Till obsession devours me
You're silky words soothe me
And just as I'm falling
I hear a voice calling
I heard it from the preacher man
He said leave that boy alone
I heard it from the preacher man
He said heaven must have sent you
But the devil's gonna get you
He's gonna do it for you
You're bad news disguised
Dressed and painted with lies
When truth is concealed
How the danger appeals
But my conscience sees
I heard it from the preacher man
He said leave that boy alone
I heard it from the preacher man
He said heaven must have sent you
But the devil's gonna get you
Looked up to see your face was
The sunlight crept through
Painting my room and I just
Don't you stop loving
Tripping on your love
Don't you stop loving
Tripping on your love
Straight out of the blue
Drowning in you it's such a
Sweet sensation and I'm
This heavenly love and through my
Don't you stop loving
Tripping on your love
Don't you stop loving
Tripping on your love
Dance on the mike one day with this drama
Don't you stop loving
Tripping on your love
Don't you stop loving
Tripping on your love
Don't you stop loving
Tripping on your love
Don't you stop loving
Tripping on your love
Don't you stop loving
Got me spinning from my head down to my toes
And my heart misses a beat when you're so close
And then love comes in a heartbeat
Love comes and you can't breathe
And then love comes in a heartbeat
Love comes and you can't sleep
With your kisses and caresses
I have waited to justify
And then love comes in a heartbeat
Love comes and you can't breathe
And then love comes in a heartbeat
Love comes and you can't sleep
Memories past are bitter sweet
Faded fast now you're with me
And then love comes in a heartbeat
Love comes and you can't breathe
And then love comes in a heartbeat
Love comes and you can't sleep
It's not how love was meant to be
I thought love was wild and free
There's nothing left it's time to part
So give me back my heart
The fairytale is dead and gone
Love don't live here anymore
A memory and nothing more
Every part of you replaced
Love don't live here It's gone gone gone
Had enough of stormy seas
Sleepless nights counting sheep
I need someone who's there for me
To feel alive and let me breathe
Well I thought that you should know
And so I'm letting go And what will be will be
Love don't live here anymore
A memory and nothing more
Every part of you replaced
Love don't live here It's gone gone gone
Love don't live here anymore
Don't live here anymore
Don't live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore
Don't live here anymore
Don't live here anymore
Don't live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore
A memory and nothing more
Every part of you replaced
Love don't live here It's gone gone gone
Love don't live here anymore
Don't live here anymore
Don't live here anymore
Don't live here anymore
Don't live here anymore
Don't live here anymore
Don't live here anymore
The night I laid my eyes on you
Felt everything around me move
Got nervous when you looked my way
But you knew all the words to say
And your love slowly moved right in
Rapture tastes so sweet
I'm mesmerized in every way
You keep me in a state of daze
Your kisses make my skin feel weak
Always suffering in your heat
And I soar like a bird in the wind
Rapture tastes so sweet
Rapture tastes so sweet
Since we connect behind closed doors
Spark this fire even more
No telling where we will be next
Surrender to your rapture arrest
Rapture tastes so sweet
Rapture tastes so sweet
Take me to the heart of the city
Where the people are pretty
And the music is loud
Late at night I feel connected
The lights are bright
It's so electric with you
Kiss me like you do in my dreams
Make me feel like I was seventeen
Don't think about it don't deny me
Kiss me now don't let me go
Make me feel like Marilyn Monroe
Your kiss is sweeter than honey
Late at night I feel connected
The lights are bright
It's so electric with you
Kiss me like you do in my dreams
Make me feel like I was seventeen
Don't think about it don't deny me
Kiss me now don't let me go
Make me feel like Marilyn Monroe
Kiss me like you do in my dreams
Make me feel like I was seventeen
Don't think about it don't deny me
Kiss me now don't let me go
Make me feel like Marilyn Monroe
It comes upon me slow
And through my body flows
And so begins the twist within my soul
Like a shot in the dark
You wrap around my heart
And I can't shake free
I've no control my head is spinning
Spinning round and round we go
Blame the stars above
Only you excite you ignite
There's no relief this burning heat
Like the desert sands
Slipping through my hands
I've no control my head is spinning
Spinning round and round we go
I've no control my head is spinning
Spinning round and round we go
I've no control my head is spinning
Spinning round and round we go
I've no control my head is spinning
Spinning round and round we go
Spinning round and round we go
There's something in the air tonight
It's what you do to me
Don't fall in love that easily
But you shot your arrow through my heart
Tell me tomorrow you'll be here
Tell me tomorrow this is real
Tell me tomorrow I can't wait
Tell me tomorrow that you'll stay
You know you got me hypnotized
When your body's close to me
You know you leave me breathless
The way you haunt me in my dreams
And I can't get you off my mind
Tell me tomorrow you'll be here
Tell me tomorrow this is real
Tell me tomorrow I can't wait
Tell me tomorrow that you'll stay
Feel the heat I'm burning up
Tell me tomorrow you'll be here
Tell me tomorrow this is real
Tell me tomorrow I can't wait
Tell me tomorrow that you'll stay
How many times have I felt down inside
I wanted to show you how good it could be
If you would only show a little interest in me
That's the thing you're frightened of
You came into my life and turned my head around
And just as quickly you put me down
Now you don't wanna know what I'm going through
That's the thing you're frightened of
I've got this need eating away at my soul
An insurmountable need that I just can't control
You created this fire when the flame got too hot
You turned and walked away just leaving me on the spot
That's the thing you're frightened of
There's little hope but the fool that I am
Still holding on to this dream of a man
That's the thing you're frightened of
All that glitters for me is gold
Always another story to be told
Uh oh uh oh just let it go
Hey baby won't you take a ride with me
I got a feeling you might be right for me
You make me feel alive
In this ordinary life
Uh oh uh oh just let It go
So I leave my history behind
Uh oh uh oh just let it go
Hey baby won't you take a ride with me
I got a feeling you might be right for me
You make me feel alive
In this ordinary life
Uh oh uh oh just let It go
Hey baby won't you take a ride with me
I got a feeling you might be right for me
You make me feel alive
In this ordinary life
Uh oh uh oh just let It go
In this ordinary life
In this ordinary life
Should have seen those tell tale signs I
Should have read between the lines
Such a fool for love and your lying eyes were
Only here to waste my time but
It came to nothing push to shove
Who do you thing you are
You ain't no superstar
That's all you'll ever be
Hooked me with your lovers lies I
Don't see the warning signs I
Ate it up and swallowed whole
Now your illusion leaves me cold and
Came to nothing when said and don
Who do you thing you are
You ain't no superstar
That's all you'll ever be
Who do you thing you are
You ain't no superstar
That's all you'll ever be
Oh I've been expecting
You missed the last train
When the pleasures of night
You missed the last train
You missed the last train
Sun shining on a rainy day
Oh you took my breath away
Love comes in mysterious ways
Stay with me till tomorrow
Say that you want me now ah ah
Let's make it last forever
Say that you want me now ah ah
Let's dance across the midnight skies
Take my heart and keep it
Don't stop till the stars collide
Stay with me till tomorrow
Say that you want me now ah ah
Let's make it last forever
Say that you want me now ah ah
Love comes in mysterious ways
Stay with me till tomorrow
Say that you want me now ah ah
Let's make it last forever
I've heard it all before
Did you think that you could have been
Take a look you're history
He's not worth my time
I'm moving down my line
I've played this game before
You're just not what I need
Did you think I'd be deceived
Fooled by your dishonesty
Take a look you're history
He's not worth my time
I'm moving down my line
He's not worth my time
He's not worth my time
He's not worth my time
I'm moving down my line
He's not worth my time
You been taking your time
Thought by now that you'd be mine
You just want fun that's fine by me
But baby don't waste my time
Good things come when you least expect them
And I'm right under your nose
You take your chances when you get them
So let your feelings show
Come on this is your big chance
Baby don't waste my time
I don't want to use more pressure
I get the pain you get the pleasure
That's not how it should be
I can always take a beating
Whoa but you take the cake
Don't you know I can't stand this fear
One day my heart will be
This is your big chance
Baby don't waste my time
Baby don't waste my time
I've been fooling around for a while
Now I'm making a move
Since we met I've been trying to love you
This is your big chance
Baby don't waste my time
This is your big chance
Baby don't waste my time
Sometimes in you life you have to make decisions
Some people don't understand
Even when you know you're gonna hurt somebody
You have to stand your ground
Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind
But don't look back if you made up your mind
I don't care if people say those things about me
I know my intentions are good
Even when you tell the truth you can be misunderstood
It's just the easy way out
Clinging to a dream that you both had together
That's not what love's about
Right now you don't understand why I'm leaving
One day you'll know I was doing the right thing
I don't care if people say those things about me
I know my intentions are good
Even when you tell the truth you can be misunderstood
I don't care if everybody finds me guilty
Even if I'm not around
I don't care if I'm alone without a friend to be found
Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind
But don't look back if you made up your mind
I don't care if people say those things about me
I know my intentions are good
Even when you tell the truth you can be misunderstood
I don't care if everybody finds me guilty
Even if I'm not around
It's just another night
But the world's so cold
She takes the bus home
But they leave no trace
That dreams are not enough
Was someone real to love
And just as surely as the sun will rise
Each one knows that there'll be no surprise
Yet still each day they live in hope
There must be someone
Who's worth dying for
All we need is understanding
Maybe tomorrow we'll try again
She'll sit and wonder
Where it's all gonna end
For the young to pretend
Their dreams may never see
It's not a perfect world
Yet still each day they live in hope
It's not a perfect world
Their dreams may never see
It's not a perfect world
It's not a perfect world
You wander around on your own little cloud
When you don't see the why or the wherefore
You walk out on me when we both disagree
I've heard it all a million time before
Don't stand in the pouring rain
Forget your foolish pride
Now you're beside me again
You don't realize that it's all compromise
And the problems are so overrated
Goodbye means nothing when it's all for show
So why pretend you've somewhere else to go
Don't stand in the pouring rain
Forget your foolish pride
Now you're beside me again
Couldn't get to sleep last night
Everything playing on my mind
You said you were leaving me
You could lose more than you find
Don't put our love on the line
Never give the heart away
Why would you throw it all away
Just for a moment's temptation
Think of the price you'll pay
Why do you hurt me this way
It's only infatuation
So don't throw it all away
I'm only saying do you play for me
Is love not build upon honesty
That's what I still believe
Why would you throw it all away
Just for a moment's temptation
Think of the price you'll pay
Why do you hurt me this way
It's only infatuation
So don't throw it all away
Why would you throw it
Why would you throw it
Why would you throw it all away
Just for a moment's temptation
Why would you throw it all away
Why would you throw it all away
Just for a moment's temptation
Think of the price you'll pay
Why do you hurt me this way
It's only infatuation
Help me get my feet back on the ground
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Yeah. They're just doing backing vocals. We're singing the medley.
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Help me get my feet back on the ground
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Yeah. They're just doing backing vocals. We're singing the medley.
Help me get my feet back on the ground
You're like a ghost that's haunting me
You've got to show me more than love
Every time you drag me under
I feel it now I feel it
You said your heart was mine to keep
But I know history repeats
I gave you everything for no return
Every time you drag me under
Why I never saw the signs
Of stormy weather on the horizon
Every time you drag me under
Why I never saw the signs
Of stormy weather on the horizon
Couldn't get to sleep last night
Everything playing on my mind
You said you were leaving me
You could lose more than you find
Don't put our love on the line
Never give the heart away
Why would you throw it all away
Just for a moment's temptation
Think of the price you'll pay
Why do you hurt me this way
It's only infatuation
So don't throw it all away
I'm only saying do you play for me
Is love not build upon honesty
That's what I still believe
Why would you throw it all away
Just for a moment's temptation
Think of the price you'll pay
Why do you hurt me this way
It's only infatuation
So don't throw it all away
Why would you throw it
Why would you throw it
Why would you throw it all away
Just for a moment's temptation
Why would you throw it all away
Why would you throw it all away
Just for a moment's temptation
Think of the price you'll pay
Why do you hurt me this way
It's only infatuation
My grandma and your grandma
Look at my king all dressed in red
I betcha five dollars he'll kill you dead.
My flag boy and you flag boy
And I'll tell you no lies
I'm a devil disguised
Or you're gonna get hurt
Put your hands in my fire
And you're gonna get burned
I may be hot but I'm not gonna melt
Hey baby keep your hands to yourself
Hey baby keep your hands to yourself
And I won't even care
And I'll tell you no lies
I'm a devil disguised
I may be hot but I'm not gonna melt
Hey baby keep your hands to yourself
Hey baby keep your hands to yourself
You'd better listen baby
You'd better listen now
You'd better listen baby
You'd better listen now
And I won't even care
And I'll tell you no lies
I'm a devil disguised
You'd better listen baby
Keep your hands to yourself
You'd better listen now
Keep your hands to yourself
I may be hot but I'm not gonna melt
Hey baby keep your hands to yourself
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Whisper words of wisdom
When the broken hearted people
Are living in a world of grief
There will be an answer
Although there may be heartaches
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
When the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shines until tomorrow
When I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
I've got a secret I gotta keep
No turning back I'm in too deep
I knew you were trouble from the moment we met
The look in your eyes pushed me over the edge
And I can't stop and I won't stop
And I can't hold back
Like a lightning strike through me and you
It's obvious it's killing me
When love bites there's no place left to go
I can't fight this feeling in my soul
It's obvious it's killing me
Never made a wish that ever came true
Never took a chance till I met you
Love can move in mysterious ways
Gets under your skin and won't go away
And I can't stop and I won't stop
And I can't hold back
How will I get through this
It's such a good vibration
And you can't believe it's true
When I give my love to you
This is the love generation
This is the love generation
Love can still be found
Everyone's getting down
It's all that you ever need
This is the love generation
This is the love generation
Love can still be found
This is the love generation
This is the love generation
Love can still be found
And you can't believe it's true
When I give my love to you
This is the love generation
This is the love generation
Right now I want you so
Your touch is so exciting
I feel the passion rising
I just can't seem to stop it
Anyway or how you want it
Now nothing can stop me
Right now I want you so
You're like a fantasy
Doing what you're doing to me
No one has ever moved me
Oh what you doing to me
Now nothing can stop me
Right now I want you so
Right now I want you so
Now nothing can stop me
Your touch is so exciting
I feel the passion rising
I just can't seem to stop it
Anyway or how you want it
Now nothing can stop me
Milk and honey on the other side
River Jordan's chilly and cold
Even though it makes you wanna cry
Ain't nothing you can do to keep it all together
When you have it all it seems to end in tears
Nothing ever stays the same through the years
It's just a matter of time
Even though it makes you wanna cry
Ain't nothing you can do to keep it all together
Nothing to the rainbow but make believe
It's just a matter of time
Even though it makes you wanna cry
Ain't nothing you can do to keep it all together
Even though it makes you wanna cry
Ain't nothing you can do to keep it all together
In the heat of the night
Could this be love at first sight
I just took one look at you
And I can't believe it's true
There's something in my heart
Heaven must have sent you
You must be one in a million
I love everything about you
You must be one in a million
When I look in your eyes
The way that you make me feel
And I know this love's for real
I want you day and night
Until the end of time
Heaven must have sent you
You must be one in a million
I love everything about you
You must be one in a million
Heaven must have sent you
You must be one in a million
I love everything about you
You must be one in a million
Tell me you'll be there
I just took one look at you
And I can't believe it's true
There's something in my heart
Heaven must have sent you
You must be one in a million
I love everything about you
You must be one in a million
Heaven must have sent you
You must be one in a million
I love everything about you
You must be one in a million
I can't believe the way that I feel
Whenever I'm with you
I wanna get next to you
Your love is like a drug
And every time you leave me wanting more
Your love is like a drug and everywhere you touch you never get enough
The thoughts that I have of you
You're on my mind day and night
And nobody else will do
Do you understand the reason why I need you
Do you understand the reason why I need you
Do you understand the reason why I need you
Do you understand the reason why I need you
He says his love for me could never die
But that'd change if he ever found out about you and i
When it gets too much
I need to feel your touch
He's got a heart of gold he'd never let me down
But you're the one that always turns me on
I know his love is true
I got my mind made up
I need to feel your touch
Oh I've been expecting you to arrive
While I go and turn the music down soft
There ain't no room for your sweet head
There ain't no room for your sweet head
I've got a one solitary lonesome single bed
And we could explore each other's minds
When the pleasures of night are reaching so high
There ain't no room for your sweet head
There ain't no room for your sweet head
I've got a one solitary lonesome single bed
There ain't no room for your sweet head
There ain't no room for your sweet head
I've got a one solitary lonesome single bed
There ain't no room for your sweet head
Life is the same and it always will be
Easy as picking foxes from a tree
But I can't get no satisfaction
All I want is easy action
A stud is a lamb with the thoughts of a tiger
Who moves like a cat and knows how to ride her
A woman from the east with her headlights shining
Eased my pain and stopped my crying
And all my hair will keep her smiling
I know you're shrewd and she's a dude
But all I want is easy action
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of
And touched the sound of silence.
And in the naked light I saw
People writing songs that voices never share
Disturb the sound of silence.
Silence like a cancer grows.
Take my arms that I might reach you.
In the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made.
In the words that it was forming.
Are written on the subway walls
Well it's a different story
As the darkness comes around
I tried to let you know
You're going the wrong way
And the streets you thought
Would all be paved with gold
But when the wind cuts through
You'd even try to sell your soul
Just the boy next door
When they were falling in love
With that clean cut smile
Just for a little while
Walking through danger
Can't see the wrong or the right
Must be a trick of the night
Between the burning question
And the fortune in his eyes
You never let it show
Or take it the wrong way
What you came here for
With those bare faced lies
All the hurt you're feeling inside
Walking through danger
Can't see the wrong or the right
Must be a trick of the night
Walking through danger
Can't see the wrong or the right
Must be a trick of the night
Must be a trick of the night
As the darkness comes around
And the streets you thought
Would all be paved with gold
And when the wind cuts through
You'd even try to sell your soul
As the darkness comes around
And the streets you thought
Would all be paved with gold
And when the wind cuts through
You'd even try to sell your soul
As the darkness comes around
And the streets you thought
Would all be paved with gold
Don't turn your back on me
Just because we had a fight
Oh how can I make you see
How much you're hurting me
Instead of breaking up
We should be making love
I need your love and affection
I need your love and affection
That all I really needed
Was the touch of your hand
How can you be cruel to me
When I need your arms around me
Instead of breaking up
We should be making love
I need your love and affection
I need your love and affection
Show me that you care
Tell me you'll be there
How can you be cruel to me
When I need your arms around me
Instead of breaking up
We should be making love
I need your love and affection
I need your love and affection
Her good advice was a waste of time
Make hay while the sun shines
You've waited a lifetime
Burning all your bridges tonight
This is the wild life
This is the wild life
No stone left unturned
Jump in the fire you're gonna get burned
You might lose your way
When you come out to play the wild life
I may be too young but I've seen and done
Everything that they say is fun
I gotta find out for myself
In the end there's no one else
Every time I try to win I lose
Now I'm gonna make my own rules
No stone left unturned
Jump in the fire you're gonna get burned
You might lose your way
When you come out to play the wild life
No one there to say you're wrong or right
You've waited a lifetime
Burning all your bridges tonight
No stone left unturned
Jump in the fire you're gonna get burned
You might lose your way
Daylight comes creeping in the morning
And I wish I was still sleeping
And the daytime is a long time dull and dreary
Full of dreams of wishful thinking
And I wish that you were with me
And I sit and I think of you and I'm lost in
Forgotten old memories of you
Wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
Wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
And I know I should be sleeping
But I'm thinking of the last time
And I wish that you were with me
And I sit and I think of you and I'm lost in
Forgotten old memories of you
Wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
Wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
And I'm always thinking of you
And I'm always thinking of you
And I'm always dreaming of you
Always I'm weeping in dreams
Wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
Wish you were here with me
An angel's smile is what you sell
Chains of love got a hold on me
There's nowhere to run
Shot through the heart
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You give love a bad name
Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye
There's nowhere to run
Shot through the heart
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world at Christmas time
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard
But when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears
And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
Let them know it's Christmas time again
Let them know it's Christmas time again
Let them know it's Christmas time again
Let them know it's Christmas time again
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Lovely boy with golden hair
Parents guard thee with tender care
Sleep now darling one sleep
Didn't I make you feel
Didn't I give you nearly everything
And each time I tell myself that I
That a woman can be tough
You're out on the streets looking good babe
I guess you know that it ain't right
Hear me when I cry at night
You know I can't stand this pain
When you hold me in your arms
I'll sing it once again
You got me so I can't sleep at night
You got me so I can't sleep at night
See don't ever set me free
I always wanna be by your side
You got me so I can't sleep at night
You got me so I can't sleep at night
See don't ever set me free
I always wanna be by your side
You got me so I can't sleep at night
You got me so I can't sleep at night
Let the bad guy win every once in a while
Let the bad guy win every once in a while
Seems I got to have a change in scene
Left here on my own or so it seems
I got to leave before I start to scream
And even now I sit and wonder why
I know I can't get upset and I must keep dry
I'm a man on the scene
I can give you what you want
But you got to come home with me
I have got some good old love
And I got some more in store
When I get through throwing it on you
You better come and run back for more
Me ain't nothing but drugstore loving
Pretty little thing let me light your candle
Action speak louder than words
And I'm a man with experience
I know you've got another man
But I can love you better than him
Take my hand don't be afraid
While I prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free
I'm a man on your scene
I can give you what you want
But you got to come home with me
I've got some good old love
And I got some more in store
When I get through throwing it on you
Give me a ticket for an airplane
I ain't got no time to take no fast train
My baby just wrote me a letter
I don't care how much money I got to spend
I got to get back to my baby again
My baby just wrote me a letter
Said he couldn't live without me no more
Send me a ticket for an airplane
My baby just wrote me a letter
Said he couldn't live without me no more
Send me a ticket to an airplane
My baby just wrote me a letter
My baby wrote me a letter
My baby wrote me a letter
My baby wrote me a letter
My baby wrote me a letter
My baby wrote me a letter
My baby wrote me a letter
My baby wrote me a letter
My baby wrote me a letter
Said he couldn't live without me no more
Send me a ticket to an airplane
Minnie messed around with a bloke Smoky
And he showed her how to kick the gong around
Told you before that I love you so
Told you before that I love you so
She had a dream about the King of Sweden
He gave her a home built of gold and steel
A diamond car with platinum wheels
Told you before that I love you so
Told you before that I love you so
He gave his townhouse and racing horses
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses
Had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes
She sat around and counted them a million times
Told you before that I love you so
Told you before that I love you so
We have turned to witnesses who have asked to remain anonymous
I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she was gonna meet her connection
At her feet was her footloose man
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you might find
You get what you need
And I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you might find
You get what you need
I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
We decided that we would have a soda
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you might find
But if you try sometimes you might find
You get what you need
You get what you need
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
Is it any wonder that I
Sounding like a dream come true
She knows just what it takes
I can't wait to kiss you
Is it any wonder that I
I'm in heaven every time she shows me
Is it any wonder that I
Is it any wonder that I
Is it any wonder that I
I don't even know how to love you
Just the way you want me to
I don't even know how to hold your hand
Just to make you understand
To hold your hand right now
At a moment like this
But I'm going to learn how to do
All the things you want me to
Makes me work all day
Makes me bring home my pay
Keep me home every night
Makes me work all day
Makes me bring home my pay
Smiles have all turned to tears
But tears won't wash away the fears
That you're never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns
It keeps me crying baby for you
I've given up my friends just for you
No peace shall I find
No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyway
Keep on crying baby for you
Come on and see about me
My life's so uncertain
From my arms you maybe out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep
Keeps me crying baby for you
How much you'll never know
And the thought still lingers on
Just because a girl won't cry
After a boy says it's goodbye
Well he don't realize
It's never been denied
That girls have feelings too
Everything went wrong
The people say that the girl
But they don't realize
That it's never been denied
That girls have feelings too
Just because girls lie
Everything went wrong
The people say that the girl
But they don't realize
That it's never been denied
My life is all mixed up
Can't earn a penny for his own cup
When I have gone away
She'll be back someday
When I have gone away
She'll be back someday
Because I'd rather leave you now
I know you've found somebody new
You think you found your dream come true
Because I'd rather say it now
No need to feel ashamed
Has set your heart aflame
But I'd rather end it now
And I'd rather end it now
For a girl to think of
I want you to hold me so tight
Hold my hand and kiss me goodnight
But I feel like a woman
I want you to act like a man
My soul's on fire and I have
Such a wild desire burning inside
Squeeze me all through the night
Make me know you're mine
With such a wild desire
And I'm burning inside
I love you so right now
I want you to try to understand
Because I love you so bad now
I don't even know how to love you
Just the way you want me to
I don't even know how to hold your hand
Just to make you understand
To hold your hand right now
At a moment like this
But I'm going to learn how to do
All the things you want me to
Why don't you tell me so
Why don't you let me know
Why don't you tell me so
If you don't believe me
You know that I've been true
And if you don't believe me
Why don't you tell me so
Why don't you let me know
You know that I need you
Why don't you tell me so
Why don't you let me know
You know that I need you
You know that I need you
Is it me or is it her
Tell me which one do you prefer
I'm gonna ask you one more time
Are you hers or are you mine
Do you want her rather than me
I need to know how it's gonna be
Which way your love will go
I'm a better woman than she
If you don't believe it
I'll love you in a way
I won't do anything to my baby
All the things I've said are true
But the choice is up to you
I don't even know how to love you
Just the way you want me to
I don't even know how to hold your hand
Just to make you understand
To hold your hand right now
At a moment like this
But I'm going to learn how to do
All the things you want me to
It will be forever and ever and ever
For I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love has ended before it's begun
And a million moonlight kisses
Seem too cool in the warmth of the sun
It's gonna be so completely
In the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
When I fall in love with you
Somebody ought to reach out for me
In the moment that I feel that you feel that you want me
That a woman feels she only take
He'll make all kind of mistakes
Is like the one before
The things you used to say
You don't say anymore
Bits and pieces of your time
Are all you can afford
It looks like you just can't see
That there's much more to love
I hear you switch the light
You turn off the late news
You think that making love
Three times a week is my reward
That there's much more to love
Don't know what happened
But you've changed somehow
Through the motions now
You touch me but you don't
That it's all in my mind
Lord knows how I've thought it out
At least a thousand times
I've got to try again
I need my faith in life restored
There's much more to love
Than just a bed and a roof
If he's given the chance
That he will abuse a woman
At the beginning of a romance
It don't make any difference where it is
With making a little love
On an early Sunday morning
With a little love on an early
When your baby's supposed
He can't leave your side
Because a man needs love
And a man needs to be hugged
You know it's something when
We ladies start to prepare
Ourselves for that particular man
Waiting for him to come home
So he can just hold our hand
That all you do something like this
You might run the water
Putting all of those nice things
And when we're finished
We have all kinds of sweet
Smelling things that we put on
Perfumes and some of us decide to
Just powder ourselves all the way down
That's good because that's what they like
And when he comes through the door
And you're lying there in your negligee
Or whatever it might be
And you turn to him and say
Do you think I did all this for me
You can still hear that same moan from him
Has to be done in a certain way
And it can only been done when
Two people become totally involved
Just out of forgetfulness
Will not remember a woman's birthday
And it's not intentional
It's just because it's the way they're made
And they'll forget to call you
Exactly on the hour because
They forget that little things
Can't even get mad at you
You said you're gonna make my lung
Start breathing in the air
Give me such a tingle
All down along my side
Give love all the night
I want to be part of you
Keep our feeling tight
Keep the faith in all
Cause everything is alright
Prepared for tomorrow
Do what you have to do
I'll share the weight
Could live with you in solitude
I've got a secret love
He is somebody that lives within the heart of me
And we both know that it's so wrong
But much too strong to let it go now
While the jukebox plays our favorite song
Right now and I don't mind letting you know
And we both know that it's wrong
But much too strong to let it go now
We've gotta be extra careful
We've got this thing going on
And we both know that it's so wrong
We've got a thing going on
You look like my Mr Jones
And sometime I wanna spell out his name
And you used to look at me in a certain way
You used to sit there way back up in the corner
Waiting for me to make my grand entrance
And I'd walk in slowly
I remember when we make love
And you used to hold it back
Cause you didn't want me to know just how you felt
And you'd moan like this
And when things really got out of hand
I'd started to talk like this
I like to call your name like this
Oh I love him I love him I love him
That a woman feels she only take
He'll make all kind of mistakes
Is like the one before
The things you used to say
You don't say anymore
Bits and pieces of your time
Are all you can afford
It looks like you just can't see
That there's much more to love
I hear you switch the light
You turn off the late news
You think that making love
Three times a week is my reward
That there's much more to love
Don't know what happened
But you've changed somehow
Through the motions now

And it's not intentional
It's just because it's the way they're made
And they'll forget to call you
Exactly on the hour because
They forget that little things
I'd be loving you now
They just don't understand
But I've been in love for so long
That I'd still be loving you now
You'd call and say I was on your mind
That I'd still be loving you now
Don't you know that it hurts me to think about it so woe
That I'd be loving you now
I find myself doing the same thing I used to do
Who'd ever think that I'd still be letting you in
Two people vow to stay
In love as one they say
But all is changed with time
The future none can see
The road you leave behind
But all is fair in love
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair
All of fate's a chance
It's either good or bad
I tossed my coin to say
In love with me you'd stay
But all in war is so cold
You either win or lose
The losing side I'll play
But all is fair in love
I should never have left your side
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair
You've got to know that father must have loved your mother
One thing always led to another
She found herself in the need of a lover
Always needing meeting in secluded places
Never showing their faces
You've got to know father must have loved your mother
And sometimes a man can be in the need of a companion
You've got to know the father must have loved your mother
Ooh you little half children you've got to realize
He must have eyes for your mother
Ooh you little half brother he must have dug her
He must have loved that lady
He must have thought a lot of her
He must have loved your mother
While you've still got a choice
It should becoming very clear
Read the signs you know you know the end is near
Where has all the love gone
Too much hate and doing wrong
This old world is in big trouble
Soon it will be nothing but rubble
People and their vices
Folks just can't seem to cope
You better think and take stock
All this turmoil and strife
You better stop being wicked in this life
Not much time left on this circle of ours
Time is getting less with each passing hour
People and their vices
It's time we find salvation
Mankind is in a bad situation
In this world of crisis
People and their vices
People and their destinies
The devil sure is busy
The devil sure is busy
Working on your soul is his main goal
Making you think evil thoughts is always what he's trying to do
He'll make you choose between bad or good
The devil sure is busy
Whispering in your ear plain and clear
The devil sure is busy
When your mind is idle that's when he's most strong
He'll make you choose right from wrong
The devil sure is busy
He's in New York City
The devil sure is busy
He wants to work on you
He wants to work on me
You're too busy for me
You're too busy for me
You won't ever stay away from me
Don't want no part of you
Because you're too busy
And if you let him he'll get to you
But the devil sure is busy
I don't want being a part of that old devil
He'll work a spell on you
You will never stay away
The devil sure is busy
He's almost running out of time
People don't believe enough in God for me
They just don't believe and they ought to
Enough in my God for me
Landlord believes the tenants gonna pay his rent
Nation believes that rockets are going to the moon
Scheduled time Friday twelve o'clock noon
Just because that old news man said so on the radio
But people don't believe enough in God for me
They just don't believe and they ought to
Enough in my God for me
People believing in the stars
First thing they want to know when they meet you
But people don't believe enough in God for me
Enough in my God for me
People believe in playing numbers
Think that they'll work wonders
People believing in false prophets
While they're robbing their pockets
But people don't believe enough in God for me
Enough in my God for me
They ought to get a belief in some kind of
Because there's somebody bigger than you and I
There's somebody bigger than you and I
I just can't stand the way that they do my Lord
I just can't stand the way that they do my Lord
They ought to believe more
Look around and see all God's creation
But people don't believe enough in God for me
Enough in my God for me
And I just can't stand the way that they do my Lord
Can't stand the way they abuse His name
Cause there's no promise of tomorrow
It only brings sorrow
Knifing your brother in the back
Setting him up for that evil track
That track that will take him into hell
You evil minded people might even be today
Cause time is marching on
This old world ain't long to be
It's gonna be all alone for you and me
You evil minded people if this old world is through
They became the victims of those trigger happy people
Of those evil minded people
There aren't enough hours in the day
And time is quickly slipping away
Ain't enough hours in the night
I know what I'm talking about
Hustler think he's winning
Oh one day he'll find
That he's way behind time
Know what I'm talking about
Make peace with yourselves before it is too late
Hanging on the corner being slick
Know what I'm talking about
You know what I'm talking about
Miracle man come lay your hand
Miracle man come let me stand
He changed the water into wine
And he healed the blind
Miracle man come lay your hand
He gave speech back to the mute
Watered and fed a multitude of people so wide
And he feed the soul of you and I
Miracle man come let me stand
Miracle man come lay your hand
You're the only one that understands
Oh I want you to let me stand beside you
Come lay your hand on me
And I have not seen those piercing eyes
That can look so deep
I know that Christ died for me
Just so my soul could be free
He's the only one who's always there
When I have not seen those hands
That were nailed to that cross
That He loves and He loves me
Cause He said He'd love me more
Than any man ever could
I believe He took that journey to Calvary
Just so all mankind could be free
He's coming again on a white cloud
And all of His angels will call out His name out loud
And I have not seen those crown of thorns
That were around His head
I believe that He loves me
Destruction and corruption is your game
Then you run to the shelter for the Master's hands
Begging Him for forgiveness for being the devil's plans
You're living in a world of sin
Destruction and corruption is your game
Six days a week you rob and steal
Then you run to church on Sunday get down and kneel
While in the back of your mind you're thinking dirty deeds
You're living in a world of sin
Destruction and corruption is your game
All you hypocrites you better think about this
But cause all of this time change your ways
You're living in a world of sin
You're living in a world of sin
You're living in a world of sin
You're living in a world of sin
You're living in a world of sin
I can't even go outside
Or go to the grocery store
Unless I see some of them
I ain't bothering nobody
I wish they'd mind their own business
But I wish they'd stop talking
People are people and all
But I just wonder why people
Don't understand that I'm me
If true love is dirty
Then throw some water on me
Guess it would be all right
And we wasn't in love
Like the girl who lives next door
She got papers on her man
That she hardly ever sees
I ain't got no papers on no man
But I got a man here with me
We're in love with each other
If we ever want our freedom
We don't have to pay to be free
We're perfectly happy
I only wish that people
Why don't they leave us alone
Guess it would be all right
And we wasn't in love
Like the girl who lives next door
She got papers on her man
That she hardly ever sees
I ain't got no papers on no man
But I got a man here with me
We're in love with each other
If we ever want our freedom
We don't have to pay to be free
It's better than being like
I might not be married
We're in love with each other
And I just happened to be
And I can't afford to do
All the things you do for this man
I don't even have a job
And I surely can't keep money in his pockets
From his woman to you
There's a thing or two I'd like to say
I don't care to claim this man
I'm gonna love him anyway
He spent last night with me
This is where he wanted to be
From his woman to you
From his woman to you
That's different of yourself
And I feel sorry for you
If you don't bother me
From his woman to you
From his woman to you
I ain't about to give him
I can't sleep at night
Ain't even ate a bite
Ever since you walked out to another
You left without a word
Footsteps were all I heard
As you closed the door and walked away
Can't you see I've been
I've hated to leave you
It's tearing me in two
I know you feel the pain
When someone calls my name
I guess we've got our own darn self to blame
I've been lonely for you too
I should have known it from the start
I believed in everything you said
And that's why I've been
I ain't even ate a bite
Seems like I can't sleep at night
I'm still lonely for you baby
Can't you see me walking round the street
Don't feed me no food
When I said like you just treated me right
You know what that wasn't no lie
Without you there by my side
You didn't understand when I didn't say a word
This is the heart that use to feel the joy of waking
This hearty eyes that see each new day breaking
And believing it was a gift from God to me
I have found these things inside since you left everything beautiful has died
Everything that I've been living for is gone
I believe everything you say
She's a thief taking happiness and leaving me emptiness instead
Everything that I've been living for is gone
I've been trying to make my feelings and conversations hold on
You control my thoughts and my body
The pain to pay and I'm losing you makes living hard to do
Cause everything that I've been living for is gone
You've been gone too long
Can't find the strength to carry on
Where you know that you belong
Shouldn't have stayed away too long
Everything that I've been living for is gone
Everything that I've been living for is gone
I sure wish he would get here
He said seven o'clock and it's really nine
Maybe he'll phone or something
I know about the kids
I wish I could see more of you
It don't do me no good
You come again now and then ain't no good for me
Just ain't no good for me
I won't be able to sleep at night
I know you have to leave
I understand about her
And I know about the children
And I'll remember that you love me
And I wish I could see more of you
You know how I adore you
Swear I want more of you
Cause when you ain't around seems like
Don't nothing go right
The time just seems to get on away
Time keeps on slipping away
I just wanna see more of you
I ain't no good without you
I wanna see more of you
You know how I adore you
You changed my fantasy and you made my dream into reality
You made me feel like a queen when I fell down in misery
You took a lot of time with me when I was lonely
You set my mind at ease when it was to much on me
You took my heart by surprise
You took a lot of time with me when I was lonely
You set my mind at ease when it was to much on me
You made me feel like a queen
You just don't know what this means to me
I just want you to know
You changed my fantasy and made my dream into reality
You made me feel like a queen when I fell down in misery
You changed my fantasy and you made my dream into reality
You changed my fantasy and you made my dream a reality
We're the two women that's in your life
Claim you want to be with me
You ain't making no attempts to get free
Every night because you sleep with her
You sleep expect me to wait around on you
When you can't even choose between the two
We're the two women and part of your life
I only see you now and then
There's just got to be a change
It's either back to being her or my last name
We're the two women that's part of your life
The only thing that's happening is we're both sharing you
We're the two women that's part of your life
I can't decide between her or you
But you can't have me and her too
We're the two women that's part of your life
We're the two woman that's part of your life
You keep playing with my feelings
You keep playing with my feelings
I wish you'd leave me alone
I wish you'd stop pretending
If you really don't want me
Remember I've got feelings
Sometimes I know I were them on my sleeve
I wish you'd stop calling me on my telephone
Remember I was contempt just living here alone
But you keep playing with my feelings
You keep playing with my feelings
I wish you'd leave me alone
I seem to care for you
But I don't how you feel about me
But sometimes you ought to try to give in to me
Sometimes I get just a little upset
When you make all those promises
Somehow you just forget
You keep playing with my feelings
But you keep playing with my feelings
You keep playing with my feelings
And then you came back and tried to mess up my life
You keep playing with my feelings
I was contempt just living here by myself
I don't even know how to love you
Just the way you want me to
I don't even know how to hold your hand
Just to make you understand
To hold your hand right now
At a moment like this
But I'm going to learn how to do
All the things you want me to
Summer's gone and winter came
And I never heard from you again
Seems like a storm came along
Took you right out of my arms
Lady storm came along
She took you right out of my arms
It's so cold where I live
I don't think I'll ever have any more love to give
Winter love took you away from me
Winter love has gone and set you free
And I'm still trying to find the traces of you
Winter love took you away from me
Winter love has gone and set you free
Lady storm took you out of my arms
I tell you before I could count to three
Winter love took you away from me
Winter love has gone and set you free
Winter love has gone and set you free
Winter love took you away from me
I Know it sounds funny but I just can't stand the pain
Seems to me girl you know I've done all I can
I'm easy like Sunday morning
I'm easy like a Sunday morning
I've paid my dues to make it
Everybody wants me to be what they want me to be
I'm easy like a Sunday morning
I wanna be free to know the things I do are right
Easy like a Sunday morning
Like your average Sunday morning
You know what they call me
They say come Ms Easy
You run into situations where you have to pay a price
For the spices of your life
I remember being involved with a guy by the name of Cesar
Who had another situation going on and
One night while we were making love he said to me
The agony and the ecstasy
The agony and the ecstasy
What's it all about this crazy love
How do I fit into your life
I belong to someone else we know
Back when first we met
We thought for fun one night together might be nice
But fun turned into love for both of us
So now we pay forbidden lover's price
You pay some agony for the ecstasy
Love like ours is never ever free
You got to pay some agony if you want a little ecstasy
Nights when you're alone
You know that I laid with someone else beside me
But you love me still and I love you
You know I would no matter where I'd be
You got to pay some agony if you want a little ecstasy
Love like ours is never ever free
You pay some agony for the ecstasy
And I'll never from you be free
Tell me don't I cross your mind sometimes
Tell me don't I cross your mind sometimes
Got to have that love
Tell you when I wake up in the morning
Don't I ever cross your mind
Don't I ever cross your mind sometimes
Won't say one thing about love
Got to have your love
Tell you when I wake up in the morning
Don't I ever cross your mind
Don't I ever cross your mind sometimes
Got to have your love thing
Show me that love thing
Tell me don't I cross your mind sometimes
Do you remember when I said
She's got the papers and I've got the man
Caught in the middle I don't know what to do
What can you do when your man is untrue
It looked very normal till I opened my eyes
The man I loved and married loves another guy
You know you and I were together
I was so in love with you
But there was a little bit
Too much sugar and you were little too sweet
But then was a little bit too much sugar and you were too sweet
I think I wanna stay but I don't know if I can
I think I want to leave but I can't swallow my pride
Admit my lover loves another guy
Another man is beating my time
Another man is loving mine
Another man is beating my time
Another man is loving mine
There was no sameness
And opened up my closet and it had disappeared
Lord I hope the man is not wearing my
And I also pick up other little things
Like when we were making love the other night
I thought he was calling out my name
But it evidently was not my name
And I passed him on the steps one day
And he was switching more than I was
And I even caught them holding hands
Walking right down Market Street
He was so desirable and it's gonna be such a waste
You know when you think everything is in place
And what you think you have is not what you really have at all
Because in my case what I thought I had was not a entire whole man
But a facsimile thereof
There was a certain kind of a way that he talked to me
Then he went vibrato and it kept going up and down
Of not when he was created
But somewhere down the line
Another man is beating my time
Another man is loving mine
Another man is beating my time
Another man is loving mine
The story that I'm about to tell you is very true
Someday I'll have the papers and the man too
I know he may not be able to marry me
And I don't mind being his woman on the side
And I ain't got no pride
I'll let you be the one who'll always have the papers on him
But I'll be the one who'll wind up with him in the end
She's got papers but I've got the man
She's got papers but I've got the man
He's doing it in vain
I'll let you be the one who'll always have the papers on him
She's got papers but I've got the man
She's got papers but I've got the man
I was there always so very patient and understanding
Cause in my case we have spent the entire weekend together
So there never was no need to call
And now that he's mine I'm woman enough to accept the blame
For it's more important to have a man's heart
Which in my case I had right from the start
And you remember those last seven suits you bought and paid for
And I'm not gonna mention the seven different nights
Cause that ain't none of your business
So there ain't no need for him to get comfortable
Wasn't it you that into when I was in the drugstore
It seemed to me everything on you was out of place
I just give him what he wants when he wants
I know he can't help but call out my name
I hope he don't a mistake and call you me
That is whatever it'll cost him to get free
He can get it from me
She's got papers but I've got the man
Do everything he'll better possibly can
I'm the one he has all his fun with
I'm the one spend all his time with
She's got papers but I've got man
I give him all the love he can possibly stand
I don't need no silver ring
I've been down too long
But I been down too long
And I ain't calling out no names
You laid a tender trap but I ain't falling for that
I gotta been down long
Well there would have been a time
I would let you blow my mind
But things have changed
You played a dirty game
I ain't calling out your name
Cause you know who you are
But I've been down long
I'm back on my feet again
But I've been down long
Those things just don't work with me
I'm back on my back on my feet again
This time I swear you ain't gonna win
You played a dirty game
I ain't calling out your name
Went and laid a tender trap
And I ain't falling for that
Every time I run into a guy
Either he's married or divorced
All the guys are tied up
If you're tied up stay away from me I'm telling
If you're tied up you've got responsibilities
If you're tied up ain't a single thing you can do for me
If you're tied up then you're wearing a wedding band
If you're tied up we can't make no future plans
Because you're tied up stay away from me I'm telling
Stay away from me I'm telling
I don't even know how to love you
Just the way you want me to
I don't even know how to hold your hand
Just to make you understand
To hold your hand right now
At a moment like this
But I'm going to learn how to do
All the things you want me to
Just because a girl won't cry
After a boy says it's goodbye
Well he don't realize
It's never been denied
That girls have feelings too
Everything went wrong
The people say that the girl
But they don't realize
That it's never been denied
That girls have feelings too
Just because girls lie
Everything went wrong
The people say that the girl
But they don't realize
That it's never been denied
For a girl to think of
I want you to hold me so tight
Hold my hand and kiss me goodnight
But I feel like a woman
I want you to act like a man
My soul's on fire and I have
Such a wild desire burning inside
Squeeze me all through the night
Make me know you're mine
With such a wild desire
And I'm burning inside
Because I'd rather leave you now
I know you've found somebody new
You think you found your dream come true
Because I'd rather say it now
No need to feel ashamed
Has set your heart aflame
But I'd rather end it now
And I'd rather end it now
How much you'll never know
And the thought still lingers on
That a woman feels she only take
He'll make all kind of mistakes
Is like the one before
The things you used to say
You don't say anymore
Bits and pieces of your time
Are all you can afford
It looks like you just can't see
That there's much more to love
I hear you switch the light
You turn off the late news
You think that making love
Three times a week is my reward
That there's much more to love
Don't know what happened
But you've changed somehow
Through the motions now
You touch me but you don't
That it's all in my mind
Lord knows how I've thought it out
At least a thousand times
I've got to try again
I need my faith in life restored
There's much more to love
Than just a bed and a roof
If he's given the chance
That he will abuse a woman
At the beginning of a romance
It don't make any difference where it is
With making a little love
On an early Sunday morning
With a little love on an early
When your baby's supposed
He can't leave your side
Because a man needs love
And a man needs to be hugged
You know it's something when
We ladies start to prepare
Ourselves for that particular man
Waiting for him to come home
So he can just hold our hand
That all you do something like this
You might run the water
Putting all of those nice things
And when we're finished
We have all kinds of sweet
Smelling things that we put on
Perfumes and some of us decide to
Just powder ourselves all the way down
That's good because that's what they like
And when he comes through the door
And you're lying there in your negligee
Or whatever it might be
And you turn to him and say
Do you think I did all this for me
You can still hear that same moan from him
Has to be done in a certain way
And it can only been done when
Two people become totally involved
Just out of forgetfulness
Will not remember a woman's birthday
And it's not intentional
It's just because it's the way they're made
And they'll forget to call you
Exactly on the hour because
They forget that little things
Can't even get mad at you
You said you're gonna make my lung
Start breathing in the air
Give me such a tingle
All down along my side
Give love all the night
I want to be part of you
Keep our feeling tight
Keep the faith in all
Cause everything is alright
Prepared for tomorrow
Do what you have to do
I'll share the weight
Could live with you in solitude
I can't even go outside
Or go to the grocery store
Unless I see some of them
I ain't bothering nobody
I wish they'd mind their own business
But I wish they'd stop talking
People are people and all
But I just wonder why people
Don't understand that I'm me
If true love is dirty
Then throw some water on me
Guess it would be all right
And we wasn't in love
Like the girl who lives next door
She got papers on her man
That she hardly ever sees
I ain't got no papers on no man
But I got a man here with me
We're in love with each other
If we ever want our freedom
We don't have to pay to be free
We're perfectly happy
I only wish that people
Why don't they leave us alone
Guess it would be all right
And we wasn't in love
Like the girl who lives next door
She got papers on her man
That she hardly ever sees
I ain't got no papers on no man
But I got a man here with me
We're in love with each other
If we ever want our freedom
We don't have to pay to be free
It's better than being like
I might not be married
We're in love with each other
We're the two women that's in your life
Claim you want to be with me
You ain't making no attempts to get free
Every night because you sleep with her
You sleep expect me to wait around on you
When you can't even choose between the two
We're the two women and part of your life
I only see you now and then
There's just got to be a change
It's either back to being her or my last name
We're the two women that's part of your life
The only thing that's happening is we're both sharing you
We're the two women that's part of your life
I can't decide between her or you
But you can't have me and her too
We're the two women that's part of your life
We're the two woman that's part of your life
The story that I'm about to tell you is very true
Someday I'll have the papers and the man too
I know he may not be able to marry me
And I don't mind being his woman on the side
And I ain't got no pride
I'll let you be the one who'll always have the papers on him
But I'll be the one who'll wind up with him in the end
She's got papers but I've got the man
She's got papers but I've got the man
He's doing it in vain
I'll let you be the one who'll always have the papers on him
She's got papers but I've got the man
She's got papers but I've got the man
I was there always so very patient and understanding
Cause in my case we have spent the entire weekend together
So there never was no need to call
And now that he's mine I'm woman enough to accept the blame
For it's more important to have a man's heart
Which in my case I had right from the start
And you remember those last seven suits you bought and paid for
And I'm not gonna mention the seven different nights
Cause that ain't none of your business
So there ain't no need for him to get comfortable
Wasn't it you that into when I was in the drugstore
It seemed to me everything on you was out of place
I just give him what he wants when he wants
I know he can't help but call out my name
I hope he don't a mistake and call you me
That is whatever it'll cost him to get free
He can get it from me
She's got papers but I've got the man
Do everything he'll better possibly can
I'm the one he has all his fun with
I'm the one spend all his time with
She's got papers but I've got man
I give him all the love he can possibly stand
I don't need no silver ring
I was there always so very patient and understanding
Cause in my case we have spent the entire weekend together
So there never was no need to call
And now that he's mine I'm woman enough to accept the blame
For it's more important to have a man's heart
Which in my case I had right from the start
And you remember those last seven suits you bought and paid for
And I'm not gonna mention the seven different nights
Cause that ain't none of your business
So there ain't no need for him to get comfortable
Wasn't it you that into when I was in the drugstore
It seemed to me everything on you was out of place
I just give him what he wants when he wants
I know he can't help but call out my name
I hope he don't a mistake and call you me
That is whatever it'll cost him to get free
He can get it from me
She's got papers but I've got the man
Do everything he'll better possibly can
I'm the one he has all his fun with
I'm the one spend all his time with
She's got papers but I've got man
I give him all the love he can possibly stand
I don't need no silver ring
And I just happened to be
And I can't afford to do
All the things you do for this man
I don't even have a job
And I surely can't keep money in his pockets
From his woman to you
There's a thing or two I'd like to say
I don't care to claim this man
I'm gonna love him anyway
He spent last night with me
This is where he wanted to be
From his woman to you
From his woman to you
That's different of yourself
And I feel sorry for you
If you don't bother me
From his woman to you
From his woman to you
I ain't about to give him
Do you remember when I said
She's got the papers and I've got the man
Caught in the middle I don't know what to do
What can you do when your man is untrue
It looked very normal till I opened my eyes
The man I loved and married loves another guy
You know you and I were together
I was so in love with you
But there was a little bit
Too much sugar and you were little too sweet
But then was a little bit too much sugar and you were too sweet
I think I wanna stay but I don't know if I can
I think I want to leave but I can't swallow my pride
Admit my lover loves another guy
Another man is beating my time
Another man is loving mine
Another man is beating my time
Another man is loving mine
There was no sameness
And opened up my closet and it had disappeared
Lord I hope the man is not wearing my
And I also pick up other little things
Like when we were making love the other night
I thought he was calling out my name
But it evidently was not my name
And I passed him on the steps one day
And he was switching more than I was
And I even caught them holding hands
Walking right down Market Street
He was so desirable and it's gonna be such a waste
You know when you think everything is in place
And what you think you have is not what you really have at all
Because in my case what I thought I had was not a entire whole man
But a facsimile thereof
There was a certain kind of a way that he talked to me
Then he went vibrato and it kept going up and down
Of not when he was created
But somewhere down the line
Another man is beating my time
Another man is loving mine
Another man is beating my time
Another man is loving mine
If this world were mine
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything
If this world were mine
I'd give you each day so sunny and blue
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything
And there's no hesitation
I feel so much sensation
And the sky would be blue
With you here in my arms
Come on baby cause you know I'm so in love
I've been listening to my heart and it's beating oh so hard for you
Just as soon as you get home and we're all alone us two
I can't wait to hold you tight making love to me all night
It's a gentle persuasion and it's the right occasion for love
It's a gentle persuasion and it's the right occasion for love
If your love is a reason and it's the right season for love
Till I just want to say can't nobody love me like you do
You cried the lone night through
I cried a river over you
Now you say you're sorry
I cried a river over you
Nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me
Now you say you love me
I cried a river over you
Nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me
And now you say you love me
I cried a river over you
I love your loving arms
They hold a world of charms
Seems to bless my little honey
I love him more each day
When years have passed away
He'll know that I belong
Right in my honey's loving arms
I love him more each day
When years have passed away
He will know that I belong
Right in my honey's loving arms
I mean my honey's loving arms
I won't to tell of my love
Where the sweet magnolia grows
I won't tell of my love
I'll tell the man in the street
That you and I are sweethearts
I'll give the papers proof
That we two are complete hearts
I want the world to know
And when I've said all I'll say
You may be old and gray
Cold winds may blow o'er the icy sea
But I'll take with me
A taste much sweeter than wine
And may it e'er remind you of
A taste much sweeter than wine
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
Long ago there were three pigs
Little handsome piggy wigs
They did not give three figs
Number one was very gay
And he built his house with hay
With a hey hey toot he blew on his flute
And he played around all day
Now number two was fond of jigs
And so he built his house with twigs
And danced with lady pigs
He had no chance to sing or dance
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
Came the day when fate did frown
And a wolf blew into town
One and two were scared to death
And the twig house answered yes
No one left but number three
To save that piglet family
And said come in with me
Now they all were safe inside
In a fire he was fried
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
Hear how the wind begins to whisper
See how the leaves go streaming by
Smell how the velvet rain is falling
Out where the fields are warm and dry
Now is the time to run inside and stay
Now is the time to find a hideaway
We'll find four limbs of a tree
We'll build four walls and a floor
We'll bind it over with leaves
Then duck inside and play
And we'll not complain if it never stops at all
We'll live and love within our castle
Hear how the wind begins to whisper
We are rid of you at last
You are now a thing of the past
Happy days are here again
The skies above are clear again
So let's sing a song of cheer again
Happy days are here again
Altogether shout it now
So let's tell the world about it now
Happy days are here again
Your cares and troubles are gone
There'll be no more from now on
Happy days are here again
The skies above are here again
I really am in love and how
It's you whom I desire
All the world can plainly see
You're the only one for me
I have told them in advance
They can't break up our romance
It is you whom I desire
All the world can see
You are the one for me
I have told them in advance
They can not break up our romance
In a clear blue stream
Where the water is icy cold
And have my fortune told
Just once before I am old
I'd like to be not evil
To be the kind of girl designed
To be kissed upon the eyes
I'd like to dance till two o'clock
Or sometimes dance till dawn
Or if the band could stand it
Just go on and on and on
Before the chance is gone
I'd like to waste a week or two
To wear my hair unfastened
So it billows to the floor
But never done before
Perhaps I'm bad or wild or mad
With lots of grief in store
If you want a fancy fan
Or a teapot early ming
Come to the supermarket in Old Peking
If you want to buy a kite
Or a pup to keep you up at night
Or a dwarf who used to know snow white
Or a frog who loves to sing
Come to the supermarket in Old Peking
If you want a bust of jade
Or an egg that's more or less decayed
Or in case you care to meet a maid
For a nice but naughty fling
Come to the supermarket
So come to the supermarket
If you want a gong to beat
Or a rickshaw with a sassy seat
Or a painting slightly indiscreet
That is simply riveting
Come to the supermarket and see Peking
Or a gentle water buffalo
Glow worm guaranteed to glow
Or a cloak inclined to cling
Come to the supermarket in Old Peking
Talking crows with the croup
If you want to buy a saw
Or a fish delicious when it's raw
Or a bee without a sting
Come to the supermarket
So come to the supermarket
So come to the supermarket
In the palm of your hand
Can't believe what just passed
Sweet golden as a crown
I will walk with my feet off the ground
I will walk with my feet off the ground
And any place I hang my hat is home
Pick up too when the spirit moves me
There's a voice in the lonesome wind
Keeps a whispering roam
I'm going where a welcome mat is
No matter where that is
That falls from above
It came like the spring
That breaks through the snow
I can't say what it may bring
It's right to believe
Whatever gave your eyes this glow
Whatever gave my heart this song
It's right as the rain
That falls from above
With a blue of our love
With flowers and rice and shoes
The root of all midnight blues
Wrap it in cellophane
Down with love let's liquidate
That mourn about night and day
Give it back to the birds
Down with eyes romantic and stupid
Brother let's stuff that dove
Liquidate all it's friends
That mourns about night and day
And I don't stand a chance with a ghost like you
On the ceiling near my bed...
Because I talk to the trees
But they don't listen to me
Give it back to the birds
Down with eyes romantic and stupid
Brother let's stuff that dove...
I go on round and round
What is this thing...
Such a sky you ever did see
Who will tie it up with a ribbon
And put it in a box for me.
So I can see it at my leisure
Whenever things go wrong
And I can keep it as a treasure
To last my whole life long
I'm so high I swear I could fly
To keep the sky so blue
When the sun comes out
And the rain stops beating on my window pane
When the sun comes out
Singing like they did before
That old storm broke out
And my man walked off
Though he's gone I doubt
If he'll stay away for good
I'd stop living if he should
Just when everything seemed bright and sunny
Suddenly the cyclone came
It'll never be the same
Till that sun comes out
And the rain stops beating on my window pane
If my heart holds out
It may not belong before
There's a knocking at my door
Then you'll know the one I love walked in
When the sun comes out
And the rain stops beating on my window pane
If my heart holds out
It may not belong before
There's a knocking at my door
Then you'll know the one I love walked in
Some place where each face that I see
Won't be staring back at me
Telling me what to be and how to be it
Some place where I can just be me
And most of all some new faces
A man who wont ask how I learned what I know
A man who will know that you've gotta be free
A man who will know when to just let me be
I'll find me a place in some new town and baby
Gotta leave this town
Gotta leave this place
Gotta find a new man ...
For those who fancy coloring book
Here's a new one for you
A most unusual coloring book
The kind you never see
These are the eyes that watched him
This is the heart that thought
He would always be true
These are the arms that held him
And touched him then lost him somehow
These are the beads I wore
Until she came between
This is the room I sleep in
Hiding that nobody sees
The one I depended upon
I don't care very much
With the rent to meet me
I don't care very much
When your coat's too thin
When the roof caves in
Sky was blue and high above
This eager heart of mine was singing
It came at last love had it's day
This eager heart of mine is singing
I remember every little thing we used to to
Every road I walked alone
I walked along with you
No wonder I am lonely
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
When I remember every little thing we used to do
Every road I walked alone I walked along with you
No wonder I am lonely
And while I'm standing here
This heart of mine is singing
I wanted the music to play on forever
I wanted the clown to be constantly clever
I bought me blue ribbons to tie up my hair
The music has stop and the children must go now
I wanted to live in a carnival city
With laughter and love everywhere
I wanted my friends to be thrilling and witty
I wanted somebody to care
I found my blue ribbons all shiny and new
But now I discover them no longer blue ...
There's nothing to win
And there's no one to want me
Like a straw in the wind
Feet are not on the ground
Drift from pillar to post
Winds up a ghostly memory
And when your man is gone
Your world just falls apart
Helps you to comfort your heart
Where your hopes come unpinned
Trouble steps in and make
You feel like a straw in the wind
Like a straw in the wind
Like a bird who's just learned to fly
Feet are not on the ground
Drift from pillar to post
Thank you kindly suits me fine
What I wanted the most
Winds up a ghostly memory
And when your man is gone
Your world just falls apart
So any place I hang my hat is home
When the spirit moves me
There is a voice in the lonesome wind
No matter where that is ...
Life is always sunshine
When the heart beats true
Smile through your tears
It makes me feel the same as you...
Come to me my melancholy baby
Cuddle up and don't be blue
Every cloud must have a silver lining
Wait until the sun shines through
While I kiss away each tear
I found you just in time
My bridges all were crossed
And now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear
For love came just in time
I found you just in time
I hear those trumpets blow again
Taking a chance on love
I'm gonna make things hum again
Taking a chance on love
I walk around with a horseshoe
And brother rabbit of course you
I'm riding for a fall again
I'm gonna give my all again
Bothered and bewildered am I...
He can laugh and I love it
Born to wander solitary
Wide my world narrow my bed
Born to wander till I'm dead
For I was born to wander solitary
Wide my world narrow my bed
There's no one can deny.
Draw me a circle that's perfectly round
Now draw two eyes and make them bright
Because they've just seen a beautiful sight
Sketch in a mouth with a radiant grin
One coming deep from within
Seems like dreams like I always had
It's up to you to explain
And you'll be pleading in vain
And even be glad just to be sad
Some others I've seen
With all your faults I love you still
We could make believe I love you
Only make believe that you love me
Others find peace of mind in pretending
Make believe our lips are blending
Might as well make believe I love you
For to tell the truth
I only tell the truth
This time I'll tell the truth
I had myself a true love
A true love who was something to see
I had myself a true love
At least that's what I kept on telling me
The first thing in the morning
I still try to think of a way to be with him
Some part of the evening
And that's the way I live through the day
The lord knows I don't hear those back yard
Whispers going round the neighborhood
There maybe a lot of things I miss
A lot of things I don't know
And once upon a time I had a true love
While I stand there and wait for his coming
With the house swept and the clothes hung
And a pot on the stove where I had meal
And everybody keeps telling me
There are may be a lot of things I miss
A lot of things I don't know
But I do know this now...
Just like me to lose my love
Of the game then it starts
There's my glove on the shelf
Now if I don't find my love
I'll be losing myself
When on foreign shores I am
Very truly yours I am
But if inclined to play I am
For reasons I don't explain
I remain enjoying a brew
And baby when in Rome I do as the Romans do
I'm saying farewell to France
And romance drops in from the blue
I beg of you please endure
My taking a brief detour with somebody new
It's just that when in Rome
I do as the Romans do
And though from Italy
I lied to you prettily
Oh don't think of me bitterly
But know that I'm true
Except now and then in Rome
I get that old yearn in Rome
And naturally when in Rome
I do as the romans do
Don't cable me snappily
To tell me we're through
In somebody's den in Rome
I do as the Romans do
So just disregard the signs and the omens
When in Rome I do as the Romans do . . .
Please forgive this platitude
But I like your attitude
You are just the kind I've had in mind
I could come to lean on you
Then I only see the sunny side
Even trouble has it's funny side
But when you're handy
I should set the table
Ain't coming home no more
Kids will soon be yelling
While I keep from telling
That that man of mine
Ain't coming home no more
While I keep explaining
When they ask me where he's gone
While I keep from crying
When I bring the supper on
How can I remind them
To pray at their humble board
How can I be thankful
I should set the table
Ain't coming home no more
Will the shy and quiet girl he's going to see
Will he know that there's a world of love
How I'm hoping that his eyes and ears
It's insanity to worry so all day
Just out of reach I see so much
I cannot taste and mustn't touch
Tied to my little world
What would it be like
There is so much I've never understood
All of my smiles were for you
Warm to the touch of you
Rain hasn't fallen for days now
But rainbows are filling the skies
My heart must have painted those rainbows
Shining before my eyes
To love with and cry for
Although the breeze is still
I feel the chill of autumn
However green the hill
To me it still is autumn
I can feel the frost now
That makes my spring and summer dreams
Why can't the autumn haze
That faded soon after in the autumn
And though another season's here
I feel the emptiness of autumn
Though the man may be
Though he may study me
The smile beneath my smile
Here is a verse unlike any verse
To a song that you've never heard
It deals with the subject that I and the authors agree
Love is a ball game without a score
Love is a sail boat without a sail
The lock on the candy store
Asparagus without the hollandaise
Plus all the petty laughs
I used to love it but now it's a drag
Love is a flag pole without a flag
Love is the mailman without the mail
A comic without a gag
But mainly I mean love is a bore
It's a phone that never rings
It's a sack full of sorrow
Or a ride on angel's wings
So just remember the next time you saw
Love is an exit without a door
But if you're in love you'll ignore
All the things that I've said here before
And you'll pray that your love
Will come back and be
See the sentimental side of me
It's my heart you're taking as you go
I'm not too good at leaving time
I got no taste for grieving time
You've been my near one
I never thought that you would find another love
Now that your future is looking up
Forget the past and go fill your loving cup
And the world overhead
Has a clear new shine
I won't be grieving now that you're leaving
It's traveling time and you must move on
Found someone that you can lean upon
And if I could arrange it
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children
Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people
People who need people
That babies come in bottles
But last week she said
They grew on special babies bushes
I don't believe in the storks either
They're all in the zoo
Busy with their own babies
I wish I were a kid again
Doing what I did again
Here I make my bit again
Once more through the door
Into a land where I leave cares behind
There are things I must find
Doing what I did again
And when I sit in my father's chair
My feet can reach the floor
My mother doesn't spank me just
For going without a hat
She knows darn well I'd run away
I'm even more than four and a half...
For you have swings to be swung on
Trees to be climbed up
Pillows for crying on
Slides to be sliding on
Dogs to be caring for
Dreams to be daring for
Long as you're living
Dreams to be daring for
Long as you're living
My pa can light my room at night
By just his being near
And make a fear for dream all right
By grinning ear to ear
My pa can do most anything
He sets his mind to do
He'd even move a mountain
If he really wanted to
My pa can sweeten up the day
That clouds and rain make gray
And tell me funny stories
That will chase the clouds away
My pa's the only one on earth
I can tell my troubles to
His arms are house and home to me
His face's a pretty poem to me
My pa's the finest friend I ever knew
I dreamed last night that I was a tiger in the jungle
There wasn't anything I couldn't do
Till they caught and they brought me to the zoo
So I dreamed I was an alligator
With a great big mouth
And four very funny little legs
Which are no good for dancing
And I was doing my dancing where the bears dance
Then I dreamed I was a giraffe
I looked so ridiculous I wanted to laugh
I was not a dancing bear or a tall giraffe
Watching snowflakes melt as a child
Beyond that road lies a shining world
Beyond that road lies despair
Beyond that road lies a world that's gleaming
People who are scheming...
But I'm liable to find a couple of surprises there...
But the tune is bitter
Pretty little world that beams so bright
That pretty little world that seems delightful cambered
Let me learn... let me learn...
Bright lights somewhere invite me to compare and learn
Who knows maybe all the visions that I see
May be waiting just for me to say
Looking everywhere haven't found him yet
Only man I ever think of with regret...
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone to watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the world
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me
Although he may not be the man
Some girls think of as handsome
I've got no strings to hold me down
I had strings but now I'm free
There are no strings on me
I've got no strings so I have fun
I'm not tied to anyone
I want the world to know nothing ever worries me
I've got no strings to hold me down
I had strings but now I'm free
There are no strings on me
Even the bee who's a son of a gun
It's all because they're free
I've got no strings and I'm so glad
No strings at all to make me sad
There are no strings on me
I'm as happy as can be
I've got no strings so I have fun
I'm not tied up to anyone
If I were the only girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter in the world today
We could go on loving in the same old way
With nothing to harm our joy
I would say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do
If were the only girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter in the world today
We could go on loving in the same sweet way
With nothing to change our joy
I would say such wonderful things to you
There would be such beautiful things to do
If were the only girl in the world
I saw the heart you hide so well
I saw a quiet man who had a gentle way
A way that caught me in its glowing spell
A love to last a life time through
I lost it lovingly and willingly to you...
All my life is just despair but I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
When I know I'll come back on my knees someday
It cost me a lot but that's one thing that I've got
Cold and wet tired you bet
He's not much for looks
Two or three girls has he
That he likes as well as me but I love him
All my life is just despair but I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
When I know I'll come back on my knees someday
And then he touched me
I felt a sudden tingle when he touched me
He smiled and seem to tell me so all through it
Control myself and try to act
As if I remember my name
But he touched me... he touched me...
The shadow of your smile
Will color all my dreams
All the lovely things you are to me
A wistful little star was far too high
A tear drop kissed your lips and so did i
Now that I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile
Now when I remember spring
All the love that joy can bring
I will be remembering
And all around the calm and boring weather
You can almost hear the things I'm thinking
You can almost see my heart take flight...
They can steal the rug from the floor
Like the stars in the skies they're all free
The folks with plenty of plenty
They got a lock on their door
I got no lock on the door
They can steal the rug from the floor
The folks with plenty of plenty
All they got to pray all the day
How to keep the devil away
There will be violins playing
I shall be flying through rainbows
And when he lowers his lips
The world will be lost from view
His arms could crush me
Father has a business
Everything from toothpicks
Stuff in our apartment
Came from father's store
Even clothes I'm wearing
It's no wonder that I feel abused
I never get a thing that ain't been used
I'm wearing second hand hats
That's why they call me
Even our piano in the parlor
Daddy bought for ten cents on the dollar
I'm wearing second hand curls
I never get a single thing that's new
He had the nerve to tell me he's been married before
Everyone knows that I'm just
But there's a trace of a wondrous grace
Life has done it's best to break him
But his strength and courage
Make him just the kind of man a woman needs
But in his eyes something warm and wise
Lifts me to the skies
If his heart ain't always showing
It's a comfort just to know him
Sometimes he'll grow angry
At some foolish things I do
Than he'll forgive to spare me pain
Times he'll know I'm troubled
So he'll laugh to cheer me through
Till my heart is light
And his dreams won't die
Though he's had his share of sorrow
He looks forward to tomorrow
He's the kind of man a woman needs
I want a gown of diamonds
Long gloves and sweet perfumes
Hats made of silks and satins
Sequins and ostrich plums
I want to wear mascara
Polish my nails real bright
I want to be an actress
Actresses play all night
If I should sneeze it's a sign
All that I want to will be mine
Dear nose make me sneeze
I want to find my true love
Like all the love songs say
I want to do what I want
Wild dreams grow wise
When sweet childhood flies
And the breeze blue the sand from my eyes
I want a gown of kingdom
Diamonds would weigh me down
Pompoms and plums are pretty
If you're a circus clown
Funny how black mascara
Streaks when the tears begin
Can't paint the sparkle in
Once I was slaved to a sneeze
Now sneezing is just a disease
And a nose just a nose
True love's a phrase for love songs
Real love's a leaving thing
I want the love worth living
I want the things I sing
I want the love worth living
Troubles really are bubbles they say
And I'm bubbling over today
Spring brings roses to people you see
But it brings hay fever to me
My luck will vary surely
That's purely a curse
Yes it's gotten from rotten to worse
Where's that rainbow you hear about
Where's that lining they cheer about
Where's that love nest where love is king ever after
Where's that blue room they sing about
Where's that sunshine they fling about
I know morning will come but pardon my laughter
In each scenario you can depend
On the end where the lovers agree
Where's that Lothario
Where does he roam with his dome
That's as lean as can be
Be just dandy for everybody but me
In each scenario you can depend
On the end where the lovers agree
Where's that Lothario
Where does he roam with his dome
That's as lean as can be
Be just dandy for everybody but me
No more soft tears blindly shed
No more soft words blithely said
No more the soft hope in time we'd wed
Love was fooled and my heart fed
No more strong wine warm and red
No more the strong one
I'm wearing second hand shoes
All the girls hand me
Their second hand clothes
Through the Ritz a girl got my goat...
She nudged her friend
Why mess around with strife
I never was caught out
To step and strut out
Give me the simple life
Some find a pleasant dining on pheasants
Those things roll off my comb
Just serve me tomatoes
Any place I hang my hat is home
I got no lock on my door
Once I built a railroad
Once I built a railroad
Say don't you remember
It was Al all the time
Say don't you remember
When you're down and out
Soon as you get on your feet again
Is your long lost friend
When you're down and out
That I'm just second hand Rose
There is more between me
The flowers in spring
The sun beams that shine
And love can come to anyone
Days I knew as happy sweet
Days of mad romance and love
Then gay youth was mine
Joyous free and flaming life
For today I'm dreaming of
Then gay youth was mine
For today I'm dreaming of
Joyous free and flaming life
For today I'm dreaming of
One love for him alone
One magic night within his arms
With passion flower unfold
But I will try to love only one man
I have only got a minute
I have only got a minute
That is all the time I have
To sing this tiny little minute waltz
It isn't easy but I'll try it then
I've got to say goodbye
But first I'll take a minute
Every note that you may know
That less I sing a little minute waltz
And hope I can sing with no faults
I know it's difficult
I'll give it every last breath that I've got within my body
Hope that my performance won't be very shoddy
Singing every moment won't do wonders for my throat
I probably will end up hoarse
Of course I will I've got it down a wager
That I made I will I want
I know it's not the money but the
Satisfaction that I get from winning money
On this silly kind of bet
Though this kind of solo wasn't his intention
Chopin isn't here to make an intervention
So with your permission
I will sing each note
That that composer wrote
As you can hear my trilling
I wasn't very willing
To attempt a thing that's not been done
And just for fun to sing the minute waltz
As I sing the seconds fly
All too soon the minute waltzes by
And now I ask you where am I
Halfway through the tune and I'm falling far behind
I have less than thirty seconds
Less than thirty seconds
Less than half a minute
I have less than thirty seconds
I have less than half a minute
To complete this little minute waltz
But every note that's in the score I buy
The sands of time I know are pouring at me
With my bet and honor with the money
Down to some big store and there to buy a honey
And a trophy for myself
To put upon the shelf
To show the world I've won
And though I'd like to end this torture with a smile
And lest someone knows how to stop the clock
You're gonna see me cry
But I'm afraid my little lungs will burst before too long
If only I can last this day
Some place where each face that I see
Won't be staring back at me
Telling me what to be and how to be it
Some place where I can just be me
And most of all some new faces
A man who wont ask how I learned what I know
A man who will know that you've gotta be free
A man who will know when to just let me be
I'll find me a place in some new town and baby
Gotta leave this town
Gotta leave this place
Gotta find a new man ...
Sometimes you think you've lived before
All that you live to day
Things you do come back to you
As if they knew the way
Oh the tricks your mind can play
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when
Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again
And so it seems we have met before
I'm wearing second hand shoes
All the girls hand me
Their second hand clothes
Through the Ritz a girl got my goat...
She nudged her friend
Why mess around with strife
I never was caught out
To step and strut out
Give me the simple life
Some find a pleasant dining on pheasants
Those things roll off my comb
Just serve me tomatoes
Any place I hang my hat is home
I got no lock on my door
Once I built a railroad
Once I built a railroad
Say don't you remember
It was Al all the time
Say don't you remember
When you're down and out
Soon as you get on your feet again
Is your long lost friend
When you're down and out
That I'm just second hand Rose
There is more between me
The flowers in spring
The sun beams that shine
And love can come to anyone
Lovers say that in France
When they thrill to romance
It means that it's so good
Like the French people do
Because it's oh so good
Leads to only one thought
Nothing else can replace
And if you only would be my own for the rest my days
I will whisper this phrase
What's in this grab bag
But no one's to blame but myself.
When you've lost your way
No matter where I run I meet myself there.
No matter where I run I meet myself there
Anger and hope and doubt
We will say the most with silence
You will dream a dream
That's free from care
For now when you wake
I'll be there so be still
For the greatest journey
For the greatest journey
Back to being free again
Back to being me again
Back to being on my own
Back to live the life I'd known
Time to call up all the crowd
Raise the roof and shout out loud
Take a look and you can see
Back to where I used to be before I ever knew him
Before I ever knew him...
Time to call up all the crowd
Raise the roof and shout out loud
Free again... free again...
The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter song
I feel the world closing in on me
I'd be a fool to go on and on and on
If I should live if I should live or die
In France when one is walking sadly
Perhaps the one he loves is gone
As in the night he passes by
And as I hear his endless footsteps
I get to thinking they'll go out
My childish heart cries like a baby
Love is a dance and one must learn it
This is where our story ends
But before you walk away
I sincerely want to say...
I wish you bluebirds in the Spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And in July a lemonade
To cool you in some leafy glade
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never ever be
I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
And say what I'm longing to hear
I implore you speak to me of love
I want to hear you say I love you
By all the little stars above you
Your voice is like a fun caress
It thrills me till I must confess
I long to hear the voice that brings me
Such thrilling love and happiness
Learn the facts of love
Learn that love will soothe and love will burn
It will hurl you to heaven and then down again
Love and learn like me that love is strange
Sweet and bitter ride
That one and nothing can change it
Love and learn like me that love is strange
It will warm you in winter and chill in spring
Invade your nights then one day be gone
Love and learn so your heart may wiser be
Nothing like you've had but you can't
You give your love to your man
All the love that you can
He will take it and go one day
Now you know all there is to know about
Wise to love but still without it
Love and learn that you learn
Once upon a summertime if you recall
We stopped beside then in a flower stall
Was all I let you buy me
Once upon a summertime just like today
We laughed the happy afternoon away
And stole a kiss in every street café
You were sweeter than the blossom on the tree
I was as proud as any girl could be
Now another wintertime has come and gone
The pigeons feeding in the square have flown
But I remember when the vespers chime
You loved me once upon a summertime
Now another wintertime has come and gone
The pigeons feeding in the square have flown
But I remember when the vespers chime
I can see Martina as a child of three
In the sad seclusion of her nursery
So her days were loveless
And her nights the same
When she cried for someone
That she loved nobody and her young heart grew old
All the children crying from the age of three
Tomorrow's dream is not my dream
It comes too late and I can't wait
The river runs with one remark
And so I live to have my say
To get and give each burning day
And if in time I find my love
He'll find that I'm no frightened dove
For all too soon young love is passed
It's tender leaves fall off too fast
Cause to fulfill each day's new dream
Some brighter road to fly along
And when I'm gone don't shed one tear
Father has a business

I never get a single thing that's new
He had the nerve to tell me he's been married before
Everyone knows that I'm just
I'm not finding fault at all
With what's too big and what's too small
You made the coat and vest fit the best
You made the lining nice and strong
You made the tip lapels look so swell
You feel the winter breeze up and down the knees
The belt is where the tie belongs
You made the pants too long
I have only got a minute
I have only got a minute
That is all the time I have
To sing this tiny little minute waltz
It isn't easy but I'll try it then
I've got to say goodbye
But first I'll take a minute

And lest someone knows how to stop the clock
You're gonna see me cry
But I'm afraid my little lungs will burst before too long
If only I can last this day
They used to tell me I was building a dream
And so I followed the mob
When there was earth to plow or guns to bear
They used to tell me I was building a dream
With peace and glory ahead
Why should I be standing in line
Made it race against time
Once I built a tower up to the sun
Brick and rivet and lime
Half a million boots went slogging through Hell
And I was the kid with the drum
Half a million boots went slogging through Hell
And I was the kid with the drum
And when I sit in my father's chair
My feet can reach the floor
I'll bet I'm old enough to hold my breath for more than half an hour
You wanna see me not be afraid whenever I take my shower
I'll throw this brush a mile away and kill that rattlesnake
My mother doesn't spank me just
For going without a hat
She knows darn well I'd run away
I'm even more than four and a half
I dreamed last night that I was a tiger in the jungle
There wasn't anything I couldn't do
Till they caught and they brought me to the zoo
So I dreamed I was an alligator
With a great big mouth
And four very funny little legs
Which are no good for dancing
And I was doing my dancing where the bears dance
Then I dreamed I was a giraffe
I looked so ridiculous I wanted to laugh
I was not a dancing bear or a tall giraffe
Be hold the way our fine feathered friend
His virtue doth parade
The picture thou hast made
Thy vacant brow and thy tousled hair
Conceal thy good intent
And slightly dopey gent
You're my funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Yet you're my favorite work of art
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine stay
It's not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me
Isn't your sweet conversation
When I'm in your arms
And I feel you so close to me
All my wondrous dreams come true
I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night
I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night
Then the rain begins to fall.
No sweet lover man comes to call
She breathes the sigh of sadness
Like the wind that stirs the trees
Wind that sets the leaves to swaying
Like some violins are playing
Weird and haunting melodies
That's how she got a name
Since that sad affair
Somehow she's not the same
And pretty dreams will rise
Up where her other dreams fell through
To kiss away each lonely tear
I must try to make the man love me
Make the man love me now
By and by I will make the man happy
He must sea how badly I want him
Want him just as he is
And may I say that sure the man ask me
Just how dearly blessed we would be
All the beauty I see so clearly
So I pray to heaven above me
Pray until day grows dim
For I wait to make the man love me
For I wait to make the make love me
I long to try something I've never had
I've hear it's said that the thrill of romance can't be
Like the heavenly dream
I go to bed with the prayer
That you'll take my love to me
Strange as it may seem
And you'll dry all my tears
Little things in my ears
Hugging and then kissing
Whether you are here or yonder
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you
Give you the break you need
More than you'll ever know
Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving may be all you can give
I'll know when my love comes along
I'll know then and there...
Suddenly I'll know...
When my love comes along
At the sight of her face...
I knew from the moment I saw you
Time and again I've longed for adventure
Something tn make my heart beat the faster
What did I long for I never really knew
Finding your love I found my adventure
Touching your hand my heart beats the faster
All that I want in all of this world
As you are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I've known are what you are
Someday my happy arms will hold
And someday I'll know that moment divine
Someday my happy arms will hold
And someday I'll know that moment divine
The moment I sew him smile
I knew he was just my style
My only regret is we've never met
For I dream of him all the while
But he doesn't know I exist
No matter how I may persist
There's no hope for me
And he lives at 5133...
How can I ignore the bay next door
I love him more than I can say
Doesn't try to please me
Doesn't even tease me
And he never seize the glance his way
The little boy next door
Affection for me won't display
So I can't ignore him
You have dreams if you act
Would you turn your dreams to a fact
If you have the soul and the spirit
Never fear it you'll see it through
Hearts can inspire other hearts with their fire
When a strong man shows them the way
Who will fight for the right they adore
And I'll soon give you ten thousand more
And bolder and bolder
They grow as they go to the fore
Then there's nothing in the world
Can stall or halt plan
Can stick together man to man
Oh what fun it is to ride
Oh what fun it is to ride
We're dashing through the snow
Laughing all the way.
Making spirits bright
Oh what fun it is to sing
A sleighing song tonight.
Oh what fun it is to ride
Oh what fun it is to ride
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
The horse was lean and lank
We ran into a drifted bank
Oh what fun it is to ride
Oh what fun it is to ride
On this happy Christmas night
Off we go through the snow
Bringing joy that will last
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your hearts be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yule time gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yoke
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
We'll find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toy and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to 92
Although it's been said
Merry Christmas to you
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toy and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to 92
Although it's been said
The orange and palm tree sway
There's never been such a day
And I am longing to be up north
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
May your days be merry and bright
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snow flakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things
I simply remember my favorite things
Like sliver white winters that melt into springs
Didn't really weigh a lot
And it sometimes made the terrible sound
The best of all it seems to me
That it made all the other presents twice as gay
The best gift that I've ever known
I'd always wanted most to own
Yet in my dreams of sugar and spice
I never thought it could be so nice
The best gift that I ever get
Was sometimes dry and sometimes wet
Was usually pink but oftentimes red
As it lay so innocently in it's bed
The best gift of the year to me
The one I hold most dear to me
A gift that simply drove me wild
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The everlasting light.
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.
And children pure and happy
While charity stands watching
And faithfuls wipe the door
The dark night wakes the glory bricks
I wonder as I wander out under the sky
I wonder as I wander out under the sky.
If Jesus had wanted for any wee thing
A star in the sky or a bird on the wing
Or all of god's angels in heaven for to sing
I wonder as I wander out under the sky
And forgive our debts
As we forgive our debtors
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom
Beyond that road lies a shining world
Beyond that road lies despair
Beyond that road lies a world that's gleaming
People who are scheming...
But I'm liable to find a couple of surprises there...
But the tune is bitter
Pretty little world that beams so bright
That pretty little world that seems delightful cambered
Let me learn... let me learn...
Bright lights somewhere invite me to compare and learn
Who knows maybe all the visions that I see
May be waiting just for me to say
Full of bright new dreams
But we can't take love for granted
A new love is like a new born child
Like a new born child
Till it grows up strong
You lullaby a new love
Is like a new born child
And grow to be something sure
Something heaven must have planned
Like a tiny new born child
Call me a brain with a missing wheel
Call me what you will
But nonetheless I'm still
It's not because he has a car
Arnie Fleisher has a car
And a car is just a car
But if Harold didn't have a car too his name
I guess I'd love him just the same
Call me what you will
But nonetheless I'm still
And it's not because he has a wealthy family
Arnie Fleischer has a wealthy family
But money isn't everything
And if Harold didn't have a car too his name
I know I'd love him just the same
But sometimes I ask myself why than
Harold isn't handsome or clever or smart
And I don't find romance and a dance in his heart
The only answers I can think about
Call me what you will
But non the less I'm still
You cried the lone night through
I cried a river over you
Now you say you're sorry
I cried a river over you
Nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me
Now you say you love me
I cried a river over you
Nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me
And now you say you love me
I cried a river over you
Are the luckiest people in the world.
Acting more like children than children.
A feeling deep in your soul
People who need people...
Are the luckiest people in the world...
People who need people...
And then he touched me
I felt a sudden tingle when he touched me
He smiled and seem to tell me so all through it
Control myself and try to act
As if I remember my name
But he touched me... he touched me...
And it's pretty frightening
I was sitting on a hill
And I was looking at the sky
And that's when a strange
Looking object caught my eye
Burt I couldn't even stand
And the great big flying saucer
Then the cabin opened up
And a handsome man got out
And he was so good looking that i
He was smiling right at me
I was falling for his charms
And only one thing bothered me
Then he started in to talk
The stranger from the stars
So I listened while he told
The story of his life
He said he'd come here
How come you got eleven arms
And he told me with a shrug
We need them all to hug and hug
It sounded good to me
So I said I'd be his wife
And fly around with him
For the rest of my life
He walked back up the hill
We both were feeling grand
Hand in hand in hand in hand in hand...
When you hold my hand
The worrying sound of bees in the comb
The rushing sound of wind in the trees
And more than this I know
If ever you should go
The hollow sound of stones dropped in a well
Father has a business
Everything from toothpicks
Stuff in our apartment
Came from father's store
Even clothes I'm wearing
It's no wonder that I feel abused
I never get a thing that ain't been used
I'm wearing second hand hats
That's why they call me
Even our piano in the parlor
Daddy bought for ten cents on the dollar
I'm wearing second hand curls
I never get a single thing that's new
He had the nerve to tell me he's been married before
Everyone knows that I'm just
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
We are rid of you at last
You are now a thing of the past
Happy days are here again
The skies above are clear again
So let's sing a song of cheer again
Happy days are here again
Altogether shout it now
So let's tell the world about it now
Happy days are here again
Your cares and troubles are gone
There'll be no more from now on
Happy days are here again
The skies above are here again
The tears I'm shedding now
I hear will dry in time
The fears I'm fearing now
I hear will die in time
But while I wait around for tomorrow
Watching life drift away
I know if I just wait
The sun will shine someday
The weather will be fine someday
But while the skies I search for tomorrow
Till the mountains move
I can't help wondering
If tomorrow ever comes
Been lived for if it never comes
I've heard a lot of toasts to tomorrow
But non of them ever say
Till the mountains move
I can't help wondering
If tomorrow ever comes
Been lived for if it never comes
I've heard a lot of toast to tomorrow
When you're just out walking and you pass
Pretty playgrounds children used to know
Little squares where lovers love to go
Disappear so parking lots can grow
Once you start the questions never cease
What's disturbed when you disturb the peace
Pets and children are prohibited
And when you think about it
Bullets fly like popcorn on the screen
Recommended wholesome nice and clean
Making love's the thing that can't be seen
Let your hair down just an inch or two
Let your skin be red or green or blue
They invent a special name for you
On a clear day oh say can you see
What remains of mountain's scenery
Catch a glimpse of all the scenery... sky...
So when you're out walking and you pass
She was a working girl
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't ya please come home
Come and show me that magic of your Hollywood song
You became a legend on the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you makes me weak in the knees
Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Honey pie come back to me
Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Oh honey pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't ya please come home
Now don't get fresh fellas
Honey pie come back...
Casually glancing at his toupee
Wish I was an English muffin
Bout to make the most out of a toaster
I prefer a boysenberry more than any ordinary jam
I'm a citizen for boysenberry jam fans
If I become a famous lady
Oh roger draft dodger
We'll make a space in the lives that we planned
And here we'll stay until it's time for you to go
We laughed and played
At the start like in a game
You could have stayed outside my heart
But in you came and here you'll stay
Until it's time for you to go
Had no beginning it had no end
I was an oak now I'm a willow
And though I'll never in my life see you again
Bird up above see what he's got
The freedom to fly and the freedom to not
Look at him go way up above
Look at the crow he's as free as the dove
He owns the clear blue
Could be there's one beam up there for me
Bird up above man in a tree
Don't have to fly but he's gotta be free
Bird up above see what he got
The freedom to fly and the freedom to not
Don't have to go to the back of the sky
Wake up you glum bird
Help us overcome bird
Freedom has slumbered for too long
Bird up above man up a tree
Don't have to fly but he gotta be free
Have to find the thing that he's after
Hey bird... you can show him the way bird
You can show him today bird
Little tin soldier they gave you an innocent gun
And then they welded your hand in place
And then they put black paint in your eyes
And they threw rocks at you
And chipped your pretty coat
When they knew you had to wear that coat forever
Little tin soldier they neglected to give you a tongue
They fixed your legs so you could not run
And then they put you in boxes and sold you
None of them ever wanted to hold you
They just set fire to you
And singed your gallant plume
And they made you lie in boxes all together
And from the tiny dark glass
Of all those tiny prisons
I can hear tin soldiers singing
With the silence of their fears
Let it not rain tomorrow
So they will stay outdoors
Let it not rain tomorrow
So they will stay outdoors
I can hear tin soldiers singing
With the silence of their fears
Don't let it rain tomorrow
So they will stay outdoors
Don't let it rain tomorrow
So they will stay outdoors
Let it not rain tomorrow
So they will stay outdoors
Don't let it rain tomorrow
If I sang out of tune
And I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key
With a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends
How do I feel by the end of the day
With a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends
I need somebody to love
I want somebody to love
I need somebody to love
I want somebody to love
With a little help...
Are we meant to take more than we give
Then I guess it's wise to be cruel
Then I guess it's wise to be cruel
I know there's something much more
When you walk let your heart lead the way
We ask for right questions
We make the suggestions
We've gotta make changes
When I'm going to wait
But the morning after is too late
The shell that's left is still a cage
The flames have not consumed the rage
And men who souls are trapped and slumped
Will wait until the next time comes
We ask for right questions
We make the suggestions
We gotta make changes
When I'm going to wait
But the morning after
Now it's time to say goodnight
Now the sun turns out his light
Dream sweet dreams for me.
Dream sweet dreams for you
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Now the moon begins to shine
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Now the sun turns out his light
Dream sweet dream for me
Dream sweet dreams for you
Hey buds below ... up is where to grow
Up with which below can't compare with.
What with not a soul there to share with
Make the queen of bees hot as brandy
Come give at least a preview of Easter
Come up and see the good we're giving
Come up and see the grounds for living
My dearest love who existed in a dream till this evening
None of the loves that you known could prepare you
For the love raging everywhere in me.
In the banquet of love I have in store
Love with all the trimmings
Love flavored to your whim
For I'll decode every breath and every sigh
Toss in some jealousy and doubt
Having love with all the trimmings
When you know there's someone loving you
And you know there's someone you love too
Close your eyes and hide from every care
When you wake up they may not be there
But tell me how can I sleep
When you see your whole life tangled up good
And when you and someone have a date
And when you and someone stay out late
Comes the dawn I may not feel the same
Mess around with two men
Soon you'll have none
He isn't you... he isn't you...
He isn't you... he isn't you...
Memories may fade in the shadows behind me
But there'll be the dream
I'll be forever comparing him to...
Sweep every cloud from the sky for me
I don't know why they redesigned me
He likes the way he used to find me
He likes the girl I left behind me
I mean he... I mean me...
What did I do that I don't do the way I did before
Beckons to him no more
All the wear and the tear
I couldn't sleep tonight.
And still have begged forever more.
Began to dance with me
Servant 1 It's after three now.
She ought to be in bed.
And still have begged forever more.
I'll never know what made it so exciting.
Began to dance with me.
But now it's time to sleep.
And still have begged forever more.
I'll never know what made it so exciting.
Began to dance with me
Rise and look around you
And you'll see who you are
How it will astound you
That the glow of your being
You'll feel part of every mountain sea and shore
And on a clear day... On a clear day...
You can see forever...
Braiding wild flowers
And leaves in my hair
Even the sound of your voice
All alone in California
I'm feeling too foolish and strange
To say the words that I had planned
I guess it's too early
In starred apple green
Comes up like a dream
I know that I miss you
I know that I miss you
His mind is up his sleeve
And his talk is make believe
He's the One In the Trojan Horse Making
Making out like he's Santa Claus
The people and the police
And all the pretty ladies disarmed
You know he has hardly a cent
He pays his monthly rent...
His mind is up his sleeve
And his talk is make believe
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see.
Just like a paperback novel
The kind that drugstores sell
When you reach the part
Where the heartaches come
But heroes often fail
And you won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take.
I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three way script
A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone
And I just can't get it back.
If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
But stories always end
And if you read between the lines
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
Beats a cup of coffee
For starting off the day
When the world is young
And makes you wake up
This old world wouldn't be half as bad
And wouldn't be half as sad
If each and everybody in it had
A little extra something
To kinda see them through
Nothing turns the day on
Or really gets it dawning
This old world couldn't be half as bad
And wouldn't be half as sad
If each and everybody in it had
That don't mean anything to me
Don't hold me up when you think you see me falling
Don't come to me when you think you hear me calling
It won't be me that calls.
I was raised on the good book Jesus till I read between the lines
Now I don't believe I want to see the morning
I can still remember him with love light in his eyes
But the light flickered out and parted as the sun began to rise
Now I don't believe I want to see the morning
Now I don't believe I want to see the morning
Your toy balloon has sailed in the sky
But now it must fall to the ground
Now you're sad eyes reveal
Just how badly you feel
The view from the cliffs
Must have been exciting
And up to the peaks you were bound
Now you're stranded all alone
And the path leads unknown
And there is no easy way down
No it isn't very easy
When you're left on your own
No it isn't very easy
When each road you take
And there's no one to break your fall
And lead you back home
Where our fantasy world can be found
But you must know in the end
When it's time to descend
There is no easy way down
There is no easy way down
Winter froze the river
And winter birds don't sing
So winter makes you shiver
So time is gonna bring you spring
So he swears he'll never marry
Says that cuddles are a curse
You're on the next train
If love don't get there first
Don't let the devil fool you
Winter froze the river
And winter birds don't sing
So winter makes you shiver
So time is gonna bring you spring
And you don't know what to do
A holly golden wager says
That love will see you through
Nothing cures like time and love
Don't let the devil fool you
The mankind broke his wing
But Jesus gave his lifeline
So sacred bell could sing
Now a woman is a fighter
Gather white or African
Has miracles for men at night
Don't let the devil fool you
Nothing cures like time and love
Nothing cures like time and love
Nothing cures like time and love
Maybe you wouldn't believe it
You say I'm acting just like a kid
Maybe I'm fooling myself
Maybe I will find another man
But how can I enjoy his touch
Knowing that I love you so much
I could learn to love your mother
And your mother's sister
And if she visited all the relatives
And everyday before you go to work
I'd stop and kiss her
Things would be better
If only a letter would come
Happiness is easier for some
I promise I will try to please you
Baby if you wanna hurt me
Free the people from the fire
Pull the boat out of the raging sea
Tell the devil he's a liar
Come and save the likes of me
I saw the lives from the streets
As I passed by the other day
I forgot what I had came to say
Free the people from the fire
Pull the boat out of the raging sea
Come and save the likes of me
Saw a man walk on water
And everybody looking on
Free the people from the fire
Pull the boat out of the raging sea
Come and save the likes of me
If you see me in the alley
Looking like I don't belong
You can put me in your deepest valley
I'll still be singing the same old song
Free the people from the fire
Pull the boat out of the raging sea
Tell the devil he's a liar
Come and save the likes of me
I said free the people from the fire
Pull the boat out of the raging sea
Tell the devil he's a liar
Come and save the likes of me
Free the people from the fire
Pull the boat out of the raging sea
Tell the devil he's a liar
When your nights are troubled
When you're feeling down
And need some sympathy
Nobody's around to keep you company
You can always count on me
Wherever you may wander
Wherever you may roam
And I'll be waiting here for you
No one else will ever love you
I'll be here to comfort you
You've gotta get up every morning
Put a smile on your face
All the love in your heart
Then people are gonna treat you better
That you're beautiful as you feel
Waiting at the station
I've got nothing to do
But watch the passers by
Mirrored in their faces
I see frustration growing
You've gotta get up every morning
Put a smile on your face
All the love in your heart
Then people are gonna treat you better
That you're beautiful as you feel
I have often asked myself
The reason for the sadness
But tears are just a lullaby
If there's any answer
And the madness may be not
You've gotta get up every morning
Put a smile on your face
All the love in your heart
Then people are gonna treat you better
That you're beautiful...
Love is wanting to be loved
Love is asking to be loved.
Love is knowing it can be
Wanting you the way I do
I only want to be with you
And I would go to the ends of the earth
To me that's what you're worth
I will follow where you lead
If you're out on the road
Feeling lonely and oh so cold
All you gotta do is call my name
And I'll be there on the next train
Anywhere you tell me to
I will follow where you lead
I've always wanted a real home
With flowers on the windowsill
I never thought I could get satisfaction
If anyone can keep me happy
I'm gonna follow where you lead me
I'm gonna follow where you lead me
Wanting you the way I do
I only want to be with you
And I would go to the ends of the earth
Where you lead I will follow
Anywhere you tell me to
I'm gonna follow where you lead me
I'm gonna follow where you lead me
I'm gonna follow where you lead me
I never meant to hurt you
I'm not that way at all
Please believe the words of the heart
A heart that seems so small
And I swear I never meant to hurt you
I guess I lost my place
A heart that hides it's fails
I never meant to hurt you
I've got to make you know
A heart that didn't show
I never meant to hurt you
I only meant to love you
And when I saw you crying
One less bell to answer
One less man to pick up after
I only know that since he left
Thought I try to forget
It just can't be done
Each time the doorbell rings
I don't know how in the world
To stop thinking of him
I end each day the way I start out
I start and end each day crying
One less bell to answer
One less man to pick up after
A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sitting there
But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
When there's no one there
You can kiss goodnight
A room is still a room
Even when there's nothing there but gloom
But a room is not a house
And a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart
Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
Don't let one mistake keep us apart
I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stair and turn the key
Still in love with me
One less bell to answer
I'm lucky I've got one less man
Once I was traveling across the sky
This lovely planet caught my eye
And being curious I flew close by
And non I'm caught here
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
I lost my memory of where I've been
Someday we'll all change into peaceful man
And we'll return into the sky
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
When you just give love
You'd better let love depart
I can't get you out of my heart
You may leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Love brings such misery and pain
I guess it'll never be the same
But I'm in love with you
You love me then you snub me
I'm still in love with you
I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
But you didn't want me
And lovingly she warms the sand
She sees the doubts within your eyes
And so she takes her summertime
Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger
Twists the world round her summer finger
Lets you see the wonder of it all
And if you've learned your lesson well
There's little more for her to tell
And if you've learned your lesson well
There's little more for her to tell
Here comes another dawn
For every child to see
This time the morning sun
Is burning just for me
I've got the skyward eyes
Like I've never had before
Just smile and say goodbye
For every one there comes a precious time
As I look at all the morning sun
I know I mean to shine
The world I knew is gone
New seasons come and change
The crown that stood upon
I've been afraid to feel
And scared of falling free
It seemed so clear to me
For everyone who breathes
There comes a time to fly away
As I look at all the morning sun
I know I mean to shine
For everyone who breathes
As I look at all morning sun
When you're down and troubled
And you need some love and care
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All ya have to do is call
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
And soon you'll hear me knocking at your door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All ya have to do is call
Now ain't it good to know
That you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you yes and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
Oh but don't you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All ya have to do is call
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
La la la la la la la la
Mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
When I was a little girl I wanted to be a soprano
But my mother said my dear you've got to practice you piano
No soprano's in demand but a piano's always grand
And grand pianos in a band make money darling
And so each afternoon when I come home from school
I practice like a bloody fool
You can't imagine all the awful things I play
I could never see a friend
I'd have to practice without end
And as the time was dripping by
I watched the clock without denial
Look out the window at the sky
I wished so tearfully that i
Could go outside and play
Instead of wasting every day
Learning something that
I could have really done without
And I could here the boy next door was having fun
And that was something that I'd really never done
When I was a little girl I wanted to be a soprano
But I had to sit and practice on my rotten old piano
Playing major scales and than I played the minors once again
Now up and down the keys I play and out of these
I play a tirade of all the exercises
Never any new surprises
Girl you keep your fingers wrong
All I wanted was to sing
And not to make the rafters ring
With my old piano practicing
But hated every minute at the keyboard I devote
In this fast and troubled world we sometimes lose our way
But I am never lost I feel this way because...
Old man trouble I don't mind him
You won't find him around my door
Johnny can only play one note
And the note he plays is this
This is just a little samba
Built upon a single note
Other notes are bound to follow
But the root is still
Now this new one is the consequence
Of the one we've just concluded
As I'm bound to be the unavoidable
There's so many people who can
I have used to go the scale
I know that at the end
So I come back to my first note
As I must come back to you
I will pour into that one note
All the love I feel for you
Anyone who wants the whole show
Re mi fa sol la ti do
He would find himself with no show
Better play the note you know
If you had sense of humor
You would laugh to beat the band...
Do you still believe the rumor
Since you took it right on the chin
You have lost that bright toothpaste grin
I sit around in sadly mumble
Very glad to be unhappy
More than glad to be unhappy
Unrequited love's a bore and I've got it pretty bad
But for someone you adore
It's a pleasure to be sad...
Like a straying baby lamb
With no mammy and no pappy
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children
Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people
People who need people
Father has a business
Everything from toothpicks
Stuff in our apartment
Came from father's store
Even clothes I'm wearing
It's no wonder that I feel abused
I never get a thing that ain't been used
I'm wearing second hand hats
That's why they call me
Even our piano in the parlor
Daddy bought for ten cents on the dollar
I'm wearing second hand curls
I never get a single thing that's new
He had the nerve to tell me he's been married before
Everyone knows that I'm just
Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade
I guess I didn't make it
But whether I'm the rose of sheer perfection
A freckle on the nose of life's complexion
The cinder or the shiny apple of its eye
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade
I'm gonna live and live now
One roll for the whole shebang
One throw that bell will go clang
Eye on the target and wham
I guess I didn't make it
Here is where you belong
I'll go my way by myself
It's how the comedy ends
I'll have to deny myself
Love and laughter and friend
I'll try to apply myself
And teach my heart how to sing
I'll go my way by myself
Like a bird on the wing
I'll face the unknown
I'll build the world of my own
No one knows better than I myself
Hear my voice where you are
With your hair in a net
In a towel when you're wet
Ride the wind to my door
Turn the high with the dust
Break the law if you must
Must I fight city hall
What on earth must I do
Scream and yell till I'm blue
Have you gone to the moon or the corner saloon
Leave a sign on your door
Out to lunch ever more
Hear my voice through the dim
Feel the waves on your skin
Leave behind all your own
Tell your flowers you will phone
Let your tub overflow
If a date waits below
Call for free on a pass
Leave your bills all unpaid
Let your bed go unmade
I don't care this is where you should be
Come in pain or in joy
On a horse or a drunk
I done lost my ugly spare
I am cheerful now got the warmth all over
To smother my worried brow
Oh the girl I use to be
I closed the door on the girl I was before
Feeling fine and full of bliss
What I really wanna say is this
I never has seen snow
Snow ain't so beautiful
Can't be so beautiful
Nothing any where with my love
A hundred things I see
A twilight sky that tree
But none so beautiful
Once you see his face
None can take the place of my love
A stone rolled of my heart
When I laid my eyes on that
Near of me boy with that far away look
And right from the start I saw a new horizon
And a road to take me where I wanted to be took
I never have seen snow
Beautiful as my love is
Like my love is to me
Nothing is as beautiful
The world is made of music
Never ending symphonies of sound surround us
Miracles of melodies abound around us too
Infinite. So with your kind indulgence and my kind permission we
Would like to present a premiere performance of a new work concerto
For voice and appliances...
The world is a concerto
Each day begins with music
The world is a concerto
Oh hear the music bubbling everywhere
The whole wide world is whistling
The heavens hum along
All blending in a never ending song
The world is a concerto
A song in which each singer has a part
A rhapsody that's ringing through my heart
I feel the cleansing power
I tremble breathlessly
In keeping with the sweeping melody
Make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
What do I really hear
What is in the ear of my mind
Which sounds are true and clear
And which will never be defined
The sweetest sounds I'll ever hear
Are still inside my head
The kindest words I'll ever know
Are waiting to be said
The most and entrancing side of all
And the dearest love in all the world
Is waiting somewhere for me
One father one mother
So why do we complicate
By being at war with each other
But I don't understand it
Why do we seem to vote
It's such a waste of a planet
There must be a reason
Maybe somebody else now
A sister or a brother
So we've got to look around
Being at war with each other
Being at war with each other
There must be a reason
There must be a reason
Somebody else must be
So we've got to look around
Being at war with each other
It's a thousand miles long.
To keep out the foreigners they made it strong.
And I've got a wall around me that you can't see
It took a little time to get next to me.
When something goes wrong I'm the first to admit it
I am the first to admit it and the last one to know
Some people never say the words I love you
Some people never say the words I love you
But like a child their longing to be told.
I am the first to admit it and the last one to know
When something goes right it's likely to lose me
Aren't you glad its finally over
Don't you feel a whole lot better
Isn't it a joy to lie alone at night
Aren't people more exciting
Doesn't music have more meaning
Don't you close your eyes
The moment you close the light
To be rid of all the feeling
How it cluttered up the morning
To be free of all the memories
Take a bow then take another
Isn't loneliness a winner
The best thing you've ever done
To be rid of all the feeling
How it cluttered up the morning
To be free of all the memories
Take a bow then take another
Isn't loneliness a winner
Light the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
Can it be that it was all so simple then
If we had the chance to do it all again
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply to choose to forget
But all is changed with time
The future none can see
The road you leave behind
A writer takes his pen to write the words again
All of fate's a chance
It's either good or bad
I tossed my coin to say
In love with me you'd stay
But all in war is so cold
You either win or lose
When all is put away the losing side I'll play
I should have never left your side
A writer takes his pen to write the words again
That all in love is fair
A writer takes his pen to write the words again
What are you doing the rest of your life
East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me
All the seasons and the times of your days
Are the nickels and the dimes of your day
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me
I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of gold and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make
Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In a world of love you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two
Summer winter spring and fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
And shower you with shine
What's on the tip of your mind
Will you be ever done
Could leave you farther astray
And as for fishing in streams
Those pieces will never fit
What is the sense of it
Don't let your little sheep roam
It's time come blow your horn
You touched me in the sun
I'd been the only one
How wonderful the moment
When the boy became a man
You warmed me in the night
But it all would seem unreal to try
And go back there again
We walked away from time
I'd like to keep the moment
I'd like to touch the man
Oh I've been to many places
And I've opened every door
I've done everything a girl could do and more
But I've never been a woman before
Nights are lone since you went away
My buddy... My buddy...
Just long to know that you understand
My buddy... My buddy...
Your buddy misses you
And soon somebody else
Will make a fuss about you
And soon somebody else
Will tell the friends
He'll find somebody new
I'd still remember you
When you have forgotten me
Will climb upon your knee
And put his arms around you
My buddy... Your buddy
Love in the Afternoon
He walked right up and told me that he liked my style
I noticed something different in the way he smiled
And deep in my soul I could feel a quiver
Then he went down and found that sweet old river
And he showed me the way to find love in the afternoon.
I knew he was a stranger but I didn't care
We had something in common but it wasn't clear
He said that life's a lover when you love and like no other
And deep in my soul I could feel a quiver
Then he went down and found that sweet old river
And he showed me the way to find love in the afternoon.
I never could remember or recall his name
But I hang on to that memory just the same
To think about the way he played that game
And deep in my soul I could feel a quiver
Then he went down and found that sweet old river
And he showed me the way to find love in the afternoon.
Then he went down and found that sweet old river
Showed me and showed me and showed me
Dry your weeping eyes
Come rub it on my belly
Come rub it on my belly
Dry your weeping eyes
Come rub it on my belly
Come rub it on my belly
Ooh rub it on my belly
Clapped in church on Sunday morning
Played the tambourine so well
Grandma's hand used to issue out a warning
Might fall on a piece of glass
Might be snakes there in my grass
Soothed the local unwed mother
Used to ache sometimes and swell
Used to lift her face
And tell her she'd say
But you really loved that man
I'm talking... I'm talking
Used to hand me a piece of candy
Picked me up each time I fell
What you wanna spank her for
She didn't drop no apple core
If I get to heaven I'll look for
Day after day I must face a world of strangers
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
So many times when the city seems to be without
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
Touch me and I end up singing
Troubles seem to up and disappear
You touch me with the love you're bringing
Have forgotten half their promises
One look at you and I know
That I could learn to live
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
Total rejection to lies and deception and sinning
For the life that you lead is deceiving
Nothing replaces a man
It's the time to be sport
There's one last communion upon us
For the life that you lead is deceiving
Nothing replaces a man
I'm hoping hell freezes
I'm hoping it just freezes
God bless and God will
And life's disillusion tomorrow
For the life that you lead is deceiving
Get down on the devil
Hey jubilation with some celebrating beginning
Total rejection to lies and deception and sinning
Nothing replaces a man
I'm gonna have a great jubilation...
And I sing a simple song
I've never been so much in love
And never hurt so bad
And I play a simple tune
I wish that I could see you
Once again across the room
I don't wanna hold ya down
And you're spinning my head around
And I can't make it alone
The ending of the tale
Is the singing of the song
Only you can make me strong
I don't wanna hold ya down
And you're spinning my head around
And I can't make it alone
To the girl with the mousy hair
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
As she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on...
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
He's in the best selling show
It's on America's tortured brow
Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
See the mice in their million hordes
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
But the film is a saddening bore
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
He's in the best selling show
I don't have plans and schemes
And I don't have hopes and dreams
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
I don't have fond desires
And I don't have happy hours
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
I don't have happiness
And I guess I never will have it again
When you walked out on me
And it's been here since then
For I don't have love to share
I don't have one who cares
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
Oh it's crying time again
You're gonna leave me
I can see that faraway look in your eyes
That it won't be long
Before it's crying time
Oh they say that absence makes
The heart grow fonder
And that tears are on their way
And I say a hundred years old
Oh you say that you've found someone
That's the way it's happened
And as sure as the sun comes out tomorrow
Crying time will start
When you walk out my door
Oh it's crying time again
You're gonna leave me
I can see that faraway look in your eyes
That it won't be long before it's crying time
It's not easy to be happy
Sometimes it's more comfortable to be sad
That is why I like this song
Let the good times roll
Let me thrill your soul
Let the good times roll.
Let me hold you tight
Tell me everything is right tonight
Let the good times roll
You are my good luck charms
Let the good times roll
Let me thrill your soul
Let the good times roll
Come on baby while the thrill is on
Come on baby let us have some fun
Let the good times roll
Come on baby let's close the door
Come on baby let us sweat some more
Let the good times roll
And I'll let you hold
Rock me all night long
Let the good times roll
Let it thrill your soul
Let the good times roll
She's the luckiest one
Satin on my shoulder and a smile on my lips
How lucky can you get
Money in my pocket right at my fingertips
How lucky can you get
Every night a party where the fun never ends
You can circle the globe with my circle of friends
Someone I am crazy for is crazy for me
Wow how lucky can you get
See her diamonds are gleam her life is a dream
How lucky can you get
When I see the chauffeur think I'll give him a raise
How lucky can you get
Weekends in the country with the baron of course
Making merry music with the one that I love
Gee how lucky can you
Wee how lucky can you
Wow how lucky can you get
She's the luck the luck the luck the luck the luck
The luck the luck the luck the luck the luck
Satin on my shoulder how lucky can you get
Money in my pocket how lucky can you get
Every night's a party where the fun never ends
You can circle the globe with my circle of friends
Someone I am crazy for is crazy for me
Wow how lucky can you get
What's your secret gorgeous
You wanna know what it's really like
Satin on my shoulder and a smile on my lips
Money in my pocket right at my fingertips
When I see the chauffeur think I'll give him a raise
Life's a bed of roses whirling perfume on me
You can spare me the blues I don't sing in that key
And if there's a man who'd leave me I am happy to say
I haven't run into him yet
Somebody nice somebody new
Someone who lets me react as I normally do
Passion is fine but passion burns fast
Passions design seems never to last
Better a match better a blend
Who needs a lover I need a friend
Now I am calm save and serene
Heartache and hurt are no longer a part of the scene
And also much better for me
Passion is fine but passion burns fast
Passions design seems never to last
Better a match better a blend
Who needs a lover I need a friend
Now I am clam save and serene
Heartache and hurt are no longer a part of the scene
Shades of night are falling and I'm lonely
Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me by one by one
Guess I'll wind up like I always do
Strolling down the avenue
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock we climb the stairs
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
Jim and Jack and John
Put their slippers on
They're all set but we're still on the go
Strolling down the avenue
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock we climb the stairs
Just me and my shadow
I often wonder why he came to me
Brought such a flame to me
And if another love should find my heart
It will remind my heart of your goodbye
You'll come back to me
In other eyes it's you I see
Though it's someone new
In someone else's firm embrace
I close my eyes but see your face
I'll find another charms
But I'll make believe
My heart will not be true
Pass that handkerchief
What a funny feeling in my eyes and ears and throat
Get a pail and soak my feet
I got a code in my doze
Please repeat what you said
Funny noises in my head
I got a code in my doze
Went to see the doctor
He said I think I got one too
So we laid down side by side
I'm still here but the doctor died
I got a code in my doze
When you're down and out
Lift up your head and shout
There's gonna be a great day
Promise that be by and by
There's gonna be a great day
Gabriel will warn you
You will hear his horn
Lift up your head and say
There's gonna be a great day
When you're down and out
Lift up your head and shout
There's gonna be a great day
Promise that by and by
We're gonna see a great day
Gabriel will warn you
Lift up your head and say
There's gonna be a great day
The Lord helps those who pray
If you believe he will receive you Amen
Gabriel will warn you
Lift up your head and say
There's gonna be a great
We're gonna see a great
Look at me I am shaking all over
Waiting wondering what I'll be thinking
When he comes walking through that door
A man I never saw in my life before
An with my luck he'll be on time
I got a blind date and I'm praying he stands me up
You didn't see a thing
He never saw me. boy am I lucky I didn't see him neither
But I can just imagine what a lox that one was
Having a blind date is better than having
Wait a minute maybe I spoke too soon
Shirley get me out of here
Ain't these tears in in my eyes telling you
You would be too when your plans with your man
But now I'm the sad and lonely one
Now he's gone and we're through
Oh you making me so blue
Oh you make me so blue
Ain't these tears in my eyes telling you
Ooh you making me so Blue
You know you know you know you do
Now my plans with my man down fall through
Now I'm the sad and lonely one
But now he's gone and we're through
But it wouldn't be make belief if you belief in me
But when they packages it nice and market it right
Yes I like him though I can see that he's the type
I'd better get busy and do unto to first
Before I find he's done unto me
He's mostly made of chutzpah
Could be I like him cause
Fanny singing paper moon in the background...
Whether you are here or yonder
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you
Give you the break you need
More than you'll ever know
Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving may be all you can give
Have you met my good friend Charley
Oh you've heard of him no doubt
Well he's a great big good time Charley
That the girls all rave about
He's as welcome at a party
As flowers are in spring
Any time they see him coming in
Everyone begins to sing
Clap hands here comes Charley
Clap your hands good time Charley
Clap your hands here comes Charley now
This way join the party
This way meet my party
Hey hey Charley take a bow
See the smiles go all around the table
Grab a chair move it over there
Let him sit right next to Mabel
Clap hands here comes Charley
Clap your hands good time Charley
Clap your hands here comes Charley now
You can tell that he's a buyer
Charley pays we all get higher
Clap hands there is Stephie
Clap hands ain't we lucky
Clap hands here's Charley now
Here's Charley let's go
Because I have been damned
And I won't be damned anymore
It was me who walked out
It was me closing the door
Billy's an alley cat that's for sure
Nick's from a horsier class
But I'd rather be with a cat's meow
I should have seen that before
All my life on the stage
All my life off the stage
All my life on the stage
How they cheer the clown
All my life off the stage
I kept closing out of town
When I'm up there I'm a great big star
And I get the heftiest lift
Up there I'm a great big star
A solid and qualified hit
I'm gonna take what I do up there
And I'm gonna do it down here
Quick as a lightning flash
I'm moving straight ahead
It's a lazy afternoon
And the beetle bugs are zooming
And the tulip trees are blooming
It's a lazy afternoon
And the farmer leaves his reaping
And the meadow cows are sleeping
And the speckled trouts stop leaping up stream
A far pink cloud hangs over the hill
Unfolding like a rose
You can hear the grass as it grows
It's a hazy afternoon
And there's no one passing by it to see
Whatever you are you're going to be
Whatever you are is all right with me
You're going to be what you want anyway
These are the words I heard my father say
When I was a young girl and shy of men
He said when you're ready you'll know just when
And when I was taken and thrown away
There wasn't a reason to face the day
Whatever you are you're going to be
Whatever you are is all right with me
You're going to be what you want anyway
These are the words I heard my father say
My father soul is clear and easy
When I go wrong I swear he sees me
Whatever you are I'm here by your side
My life is a rope that won't come untied
Oh I'm going to stand by you right or wrong
These are the words within my father's song
By the way did I hear you say
If some night I seem too lonely
Have I told you yet that only recently
Took the towels we stole
From some motel in Tennessee
He was gone long before he really left
Anyway that's all yesterday
If you try calling by and by
You don't look a thing like he did
And it's time to play
Why can't we make love fall
All through this long and sleepless night
I hear my neighbors talking
They say our love ain't
And everyone knows but me
I close my eyes not wanting to hear
But the words are loud and clear
Through these walls so thin
I hear my neighbors when
They say my heart's in danger
For the love of a stranger
You're just what my heart desires
My whole world you inspire
I can't bear I think I'm losing you
Through these walls so thin
I hear my neighbors when
They say my heart's in danger
For the love of a stranger
I never had much money
My jokes don't end that funny
And I had door slammed on my face
But I think you've charmed me
I always hoped that someone would
I never had a love like this before
No... I never had it so good
I'm not the type that's trusted
Always tripping over logs
And often I've been busted
And chased by friendly dogs
But I think you've charmed me
I always hoped that someone would
I never had a love like this before
No... I never had it so good
But I think you've charmed me
I always hoped that someone would
I never had a love like this before
While thinking of love
I wrote him some words and mailed them away
I found at my door a letter from Spain
He'd sent long before
I haven't heard from you in weeks
I must assume that you no longer care
From letters that cross in the mail
And you think you'll find your fate tomorrow night
I sat with swords in my heart
And pen in a hand I wrote
I'm glad that we're through
Full of hate I mailed it
But then in a week a letter arrived
With love did it speak
I loved the tender words you sent
It seems I wronged you please forgive me
Our letters will cross in the mail
How time brings a loss
God has mad us fall in love
It's true I've really found
The love you feel for me
That you will be by my side
Until my life is through
We can conquer the world
That may not be here forever
But I found strength in you
I only pray that I have shown you
Because that's all that I am living for
Don't worry what happens to me
You will stay here always
We can conquer the world
I'm feeling mighty sick and sore
I said I'm feeling sick and sore
My man don't love me no more
My sweet man I love him so
Though he's mean as can be
Who needs the kind of woman like me
If sweet man should pass me by
If I doubt where he'd be
Who needs the kind of woman like me
Don't know any reason why he treats me so poorly
What have I gone and done
Makes my trouble double
With these worries when surely
My sweet man is gonna go
Who needs the kind of woman like me
Don't know any reason why he treats me so coolly
What have I gone and done
He makes my trouble double
With these worries when surely
I ain't deserving enough
My sweet man is gonna go
We've suddenly stepped through
Her chin is like mine
But her eyes are yours
How perfectly formed are her fingers
What words will be formed by her fingers
There are songs that sound like movies
There are themes that fill the screen
There are lines I say that sound as if they're written
There are looks I wear the theater should have seen
But though I've made my life a movie
And I must stagger out into the blinding sunlight half alive
Wishing I were back inside the picture show
There where it's always night
Notice how the screen is wide
The second role I've said around too tight
Lie my mind with lies
Find the world like nothing that I've seen
As we walk from out the movie
Are we acting out a scene
Does the orchestra play chords
Do we move just like slow motion
Life's a constant disappointment
When you live on celluloid
But my movie expectations are a dream I can't avoid
Waiting for a man to say the things
That I heard in the film last night
But he doesn't want to play the role
And he can't pick his cues up right
Blinding me with lies
Finding I've been fooled by what I've seen
All we have is life and mind
And love we find with a friend
I love you still too much
That pressed sadly against your will
Of the web it's the fly she seeks
You may be her lover but you never will recover
Remember what I told you
She's got eight arms to hold ya
She'll tuck you into bed
Then she'll wrap you as a midnight snack.
So if you see a spider
Don't you saddle up beside her
Pray that you be left on your own
Long before Atlantis there has been a praying mantis
And you know why he's on his knees
If a woman even starts to tease
He won't even QUIBBLE if she has a little nibble
On his neck what a way to go
She's a blue blooded wasp you know
And just as you do it she'll inject you with a fluid
That you ain't even got but none
You're meat on the plate
Not even first rate she's gonna feed you to her seventh son.
JUST LIKE A Queen bee baby
Pray that you MAY be left on your own own own own own own own
So in conclusion it's an optical illusion
If you think that we're the weaker race.
And the truth is staring in your face.
Headed eagle need a woman just to keep them fed. But come the evening we're like Adam and his Eve inside the garden hear the serpents sound
It's so frustrating when your really into mating
It's so frustrating when your really into mating
And there isn't a loving man around.
It's so frustrating when your really into mating
And there isn't a loving man around.
Give me them and I'll swing...
Write me a sequel give me an equal
Oh and I'll give that man
I said I'm gonna give that loving man
I said I'm gonna give that loving man
I said I'm gonna give that loving sting...
I want to learn what life is for
Ask what I want and I will sing
I'd cure the cold and the traffic jam
Speak Portuguese and Dutch
And if it's not too much
I'd like to have the perfect twin
One who'd go out as I came in
I've got to grab the big brass ring
I'm like a child who's set free
Every ride invites me
I could live as I must
Give me the time to turn the tide
Give me the truth if once I lied
Give me the man who's gonna bring
Then I'll have everything
And love is in the wind
Like some music in a dream
You made them all come true
When you came inside of my life
And lost in your eyes
I could spend all of my time
Hearing songs you sing
Feeling love you bring
Darling being close to you
Made all my dreams come true
When you came inside my life
Look who's advertising
Billboards everywhere
Traffic is backed up for miles
Attendants welcome you with devilish smiles
Steady ... steady ...
Have your tickets ready
Steady ... steady ...
It's a sin filled city
It's a one way ticket to the other side
Even the devil needs money
To cover his overhead
Or so his press agent said
Hang out with heavies
Your partners in crime
Steady ... steady ...
Have your tickets ready
Steady ... steady ...
It's a sin filled city
It's a one way ticket to the other side
It's a Dr. Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde
Get down and study suspicion and doubt
Listen mischief makers
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you
Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
You and I will make each night a first
Every day a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
Two lights that shine as one
Morning glory and midnight sun
Time we've learned to sail above
Time won't change the meaning of one love
I was warned as a child of thirteen
Not to act too strong
Try to look like you belong but don't push girl
Save your time and trouble
Memorize your lines and move as directed
That's an age old story
Everybody knows that's a worn out song
But you and I are changing that tune
We're learning new rhythms from the woman
I said the woman in the moon
Don't believe a word about
Things you heard about
But they can never hold the woman in the moon
I believe there's a best of both worlds
Recognizing change is seldom expected
They believed that strange was a word for wrong
We're learning new rhythms from that woman in the moon
Don't believe a word about
Things you heard about
But they can never hold the woman
Where there used to be a soul inside
Could blow right through you
Monkey do and monkey see
I believe it nobody sold
Always knew it nobody told
I believe in someone to hold me
Sleeping in an empty bed
A place to rest my head
I don't want to find myself on day
Waking up and looking at Monday
With some what's his name left from Sunday
I believe it nobody sold
Always knew it nobody told
I believe in someone to hold me
With one more look at you
I could learn to tame the clouds and let the sun shine through
Leave a troubled past and I might start anew
I'll solve the mysteries if you're the prize
Refresh these tired eyes
With one more look or you I might overcome the anger
That I've learned to know
Find a peace of mind I lost so long ago
Your gentle touch has made me strong again
I'm everything and more that I had dreamed I'd be
My spirit feels a promise
I'd learn to change the stars
And change our fortunes too
I'd have the constellations point your portrait too
So all the world might share this wondrous sight
The world could end each night
With one more look at you
With one more look at you
I want one more look at you
Your eyes ore like fingers
I'm riding the passion arising inside me
I see the hunger arise in your eyes
And it's urging me on
Higher and harder and it's faster and farther
Your pleasure is part of the secret
Of flight that I found
When I feel like on eagle
My soul has no place on the ground
If you don't look away I'm secure
In the fact that you won't let me fall
Are you watching me now
I'm the master magician
Who'll help you escape
From the lies you've been told
When they're breaking your back
Bring the last straw to me
I turn straw into gold
I break chains made of boredom
That others have lived with for years
I leave good news on doorsteps
And laughs where there used to be tears
I'm gonna need you later
When you're not around
Are you watching me now
Are you watching me now
Love soft as an easy chair
Love fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you
Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
You and I will make each night the first
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
They warm and excite us
Two lights that shine as one Morning glory and midnight sun
Time... we've learned to sail above
Time... won't change the meaning of one love
Baby I can fly like a bird
When you touch me with your eyes
Flying through the sky
I've never felt the same
When you love me it's easy
I can do most anything
One wing up and one wing down
I never thought I would
Fall in love for good
When you love me its easy
My sweet life has just begun
There's nothing I can do
My sweet life has just begun
I'm in love each time and I know I'll have it
Fell into my life so I grabbed it
There's nothing I can do
They say her pretty face is enough to launch a ship
Mix that with charm and style
With all the admiration the world is at her feet
She's living for attention when she's spotted on the street
Don't believe what you read
About the life that I lead
I'll just show my face in town
Gets old answering questions why and trying to explain
Why I prefer to stay at home with friends and entertain
Don't believe what you read
About the life that I lead
To the outside world it's paradise
They'd love to be in my shoes
They don't seem to realize that it's not like in the news
Don't believe what you read
About the life that I lead
I just read in the papers that I bought some birds today
Flying all around my house
But there's nothing I can do
Just puts me in a rage
Don't believe what you read
About the life that I lead
Don't believe what you read
Well I'm stacking up skirts and things
Packing up and fixing to go
For some little reason that I can't remember
But just one little kiss could put
Maybe I might change my mind
Baby me Baby everyday
Make all my blues go away
Baby me Baby everyday
I'll baby you the same way.
Sometimes the times are good times and
Are not quite so good as the good times should be
But just one word from you and
I'll put all of my suitcases down
Maybe I might stick around.
Baby me Baby everyday
Make all my blues go away
Baby me Baby everyday
I went looking for a new love
A different kind of true love
Who would treat me right
Me but you. just me and you.
I went looking for a new love
A different kind of true love
Who's gonna treat me right
Then I found what I was after
Now my life is filled with laughter
I was lost with no direction
And my life was one big question
Now I know just where I'm going
And my happiness is showing
He loves to spend my money
Likes to call me honey
Gonna hug and squeeze him
He's gonna love me madly
I'm gonna to love him gladly
We're gonna hold love while we can
I went looking for a new love
A different kind of true love
Then I found what I was after
Now my life is filled with laughter
He loves to spend my money
And he loves to call me ho ho honey
Gonna hug and squeeze him
He's gonna love me madly
I'm gonna to love him gladly
We're gonna hold love while we can
We're gonna hold love while we can
Baby I went looking for a new love
Different kind of true love
I found what I was after
My life is filled with laughter
Looking for a true love
Some kind of new love
Who's gonna treat me right
Does it take a while before you smile
Are your dreams like premonitions
Have you lived them through
I hope you'll answer me with patient eyes
They'll tell me as much as I need to know
Answer me with deep and restful sleeping
And if you dream in sleep
They're yours to keep
No you need not answer me
Who's touched your heart
My heart has gone to sleep
My heart belongs to me.
My heart belongs to me.
But we knew what had to be
But my heart belongs to me.
Put out the light and close your eyes
My heart belongs to me.
But my heart belongs to me.
My heart belongs to me.
Church bells were ringing and I heard angels singing
He gave me a kiss and I thought wedded bliss
The he carried me across the threshold and I heard the front door slam
Cabin fever had just began
If I don't remind him it's time to get up
He tells me it's my fault he's late
Now I clean up the kitchen till noontime
And then I vacuum till a quarter to three
Cabin fever is killing me
When he knows that it's already done
My kids climb the curtains and I climb the walls
He's with the boys having fun
Let me try to get a breath of fresh air
Cabin fever's killing me
Cabin fever's killing me
Love comes from the most unexpected places
In someone's eyes you've never met
Who wants to get to know you
In someone's smile you can't forget
And if the music plays on in your mind
Take all the love that you can find
And if love takes you in
Take all the love that you can find
And hope it comes again
Love comes from the most unexpected places
A love song on the radio you never heard enough of
In bars that thrive on loneliness
Where people sell their sorrow for your time
They take the love that they can find
And if love takes them in
They take the love that they can find
And hope it comes again
Love comes in many ways
So here I stand outside your door
And I'm trying to tell you just once more
Love comes from the most unexpected places
Alone again I search a street of unrelated faces
Where strangers look the other way
And take the love that you can find
And if love takes you in
Take all the love that you can find
Some folks like to get away
Take a holiday from the neighborhood
Seen all those movie stars
And their fancy cars and their limousines
And I don't wanna waste more time
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
Comes down to reality
I don't have any reasons
I've left them all behind
I don't have any reasons
Cause left them all behind
I've got things so together
That I just can't fall asleep
Walked the night and drank the moon
As I unlocked my door.
It's really lovely to discover
That you like to be alone
Not to owe your man an answer
When he gets you on the phone
When you crave champagne and cheese
And your aim becomes to please yourself
And not to aim to please
Oh they sold me when they told me
Two can live as cheap as one
But I'm learning twice you're earning
Doesn't mean it's twice the fun
If you spend your each dime and all your time
On someone else's schemes
I'm not needy but I'm greedy
And I live my deepest dreams
Take an hour in the shower
Use the water while it's hot
In the tub a hand to scrub my back
Is all I haven't got.
I take the day for quite a ride
And I take my own sweet time
Time to spare and time to share
And grateful I would be
If just one damn man would share the need
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow there'll be sun
Just thinking about tomorrow
Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow till there's none
When I'm stuck with a day that's gray and lonely
You're always a day away...
I just stick out my chin and grin and say
You're always a day away...
You're always a day away
I'll tell you a story
Every mountain and stream
That lives in my dream
Maybe someday he will happen to you
It's like he's always watching over me
I do believe in magic
When it's plain to see
Maybe someday he will happen to you
Softly he whispers into my ear
Softly he whispers into my ear
Take me in your dreams
Please don't leave me waiting here
Softly he whispers into my ear
But I don't wanna hear... I don't wanna hear
Thinking something might be saved
Growing tired of broken promises
And dreams you never made
And I wanted to be more than just a friend
Not knowing I would hurt so in the end
So I swore I'd never call you home again
Took time to see through all the glitter
I was blinded by your fire light
And swept myself away
And I guess I couldn't bring myself to see
You had taken all the very best of me
So I'm leaving while there's something left of me
You know I thought I knew the answers
And one more time around won't break me
You will never see that side of me
I told my service to pick up all my calls
And I've taken down our photographs
That lined our bedroom walls
And the outside door no longer has your name
All your clothes are gone
My welcome mat's been changed
But the key's still there
And I've left the door unchained
I've been hurt before
And just one more time around
You will never see that side of me
Would you feel better
When I hear your name I just break down
It's just a love breakdown
And I don't understand
Tonight I'm gonna die if I don't get your love
Lately I realize I'm no good without you
I just fall to pieces
When it's late at night
It's just my love breakdown
And I don't understand
When you don't come around
Tonight I'm gonna die if I don't get your love
You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When you come through the door
At the end of the day
You couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
When it's good for you
And you're feeling alright
Well you just roll over
And turn out the light
And you don't bring me flowers anymore
It used to be so natural
To talk about forever
They just lay on the floor
All the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh
And I learned how to cry
Well I learned how to love
Even learned how to lie
So you'd think I could learn
How to tell you goodbye
Because they feel so good
And they feel like you
Because they get to me
They touch me and then move me
Anything more to keep me warm
I feel the feeling of you
No other feeling will ever do
Because they feel so good
And they feel like you
They're just like old friends
They comfort me and soothe me
They're not brand new
But they're comfy and roomy
They do something to me
And when I stay at home
Because they feel so good
And they feel like you
I feel the feeling of you
No other feeling will ever do
Because they feel so good
And they feel like you...
But through it all it was you who pulled me out
Please don't leave me now
Give me one more night to have you near
There's a man at the train stop
With tears in his eyes
Reminds me of so long ago
When I was able to cry
Slip away and laugh along
With anyone who needs someone blue
Just give me one more night to hold you
Give me one more night to have you near
To have just one more night to hold you
Stay away leave me alone
Stay away from my door
Don't want no excuses
I don't want no more lies
Stay away out of my dreams
Stay away from my nights
You're there in the darkness
So I need no other lights
Makes me call you at midnight
And beg you to come back again
To waste it on regrets
They say it heals a broken heart
That's waiting to forget
Like you hurt me before
But if you should need me
Don't think it's all right
Don't think you can call me up
In the middle of some lonely night
There I am reaching for you
Longing to turn to you
That's all I want oh so much
Deep in the night I need you
Daytimes I always get through
But when the sun goes down
Deep in the night I need you
Read a book and I think about you
Put it down and I think about you
I make some coffee and I think about you
Wash up the cup and I think about you
Wind the clock and I think about you
Turn on the light and I think about you
When I punch the pillow and I think about you
Deep in the night I feel lonely
It didn't work out I know
But I know but I know
Songbird sings from the heart
Each word can tear you apart
I sing you sing along
You find your life in my song
When you need the strength to carry on
You've got me to turn to
With the songs that I sing
And the magic they bring
They've helped you be strong now
The song sets you free
Who sings for songbird
Sometimes when I'm all alone
I sing my saddest song
Lonely and no one can see
This time the song is for me
I can touch your secret place inside
And still you don't know me
With the songs that I sing
And the magic they bring
You've learned to be strong now
My song sets you free
Rain is clean and new
New is the morning and morning dew
Wet is a kiss that touches you
Sea is mysterious blue
Blue is for sadness and sad is for crying
Would you share these things with me
And let the tears fall as they wade
I'm not afraid of melt in the rain
I'm not afraid to be lost at sea
I'm not afraid to cry again
Because it's tears of joy
Would you share these things with me
And let the tears fall as they wade
Love that's flowing free
Free is the feeling I feel deep inside me
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain and deep as a river
Come rain or come shine
I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or were out of the money
Come rain or come shine
Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or were out of the money
But I'm with you always
Long ago a Saturday night
Thinking everything was all right
And when I stepped out the tub
And I opened up my door and than
Bing bang I saw the whole gang
Shaking like they're taking a drug
So I put on the jacket and roll up the wine
I was rolling and strolling
I was moving and grooving
I was reeling with feeling
How was I to know there was a party going on
How was I to know there was a party going on
When memories cloud the skies
Because you've said goodbye
But the wind remembers all our favorite tunes
Remembering what happened a moment ago
While it's resting on pillows of sky
Together we lie in a calm that comes after a storm
I love the quiet right after the rain here with you
The trees all in green hang the leaves out to dry
Are there loving reflections of me
I feel like a flower that longs for a shower again
Though I don't know just what magic the raindrops contain
You look at me so differently
We're both too wise for alibis
We talk but there's so much that we don't say
I guess I've gotten used to it this way
But in Niagara you promised me the moon
And when I fell I couldn't tell it happened all to soon
Up in Niagara we were foolish then
You hold my hand to please my friends
And even though I'm reaching out
It feels as though there's nothing coming in
And maybe this is how we've always been
But in Niagara you took me by surprise
I knew you heard my every word just looking in my eyes
Up in Niagara we were crazy then
Up in Niagara we were crazy then
I'm starting to walk and I'm learning to run
I'm seeing my friends and I'm having some fun
And the heartache and pain like the thunder and rain
There's a brand new world just waiting outside my door
I ain't gonna cry tonight
Not while the music feels so good
You've got your friends and I'll get mine
Go out and have a real good time
I'm changing my style with a positive grin
And this feeling of joy comes from within
And the heartache and pain like the thunder and rain
There's a brand new world just waiting outside my door
I ain't gonna cry tonight
Not while the music feels so good
You've got your friends and I'll be fine
Go out and have a real good time
And the heartache and pain and the thunder and rain
And I'm not gonna cry my heart out anymore
I ain't gonna cry tonight
I ain't gonna cry tonight
I ain't gonna cry tonight
Not while the music feels so good
You've got your friends and I'll get mine
Go out and have a real good
I ain't gonna cry tonight
Not while the music feels so good
I ain't gonna cry tonight
I ain't gonna cry tonight
Learning to walk learning to run
I remember sitting on the front steps
Feeling the softness of a warm summer rain
I see the reflections of my mind
All the sadness all the pain
How fast they slip away
And though my dreams have come and gone
With one wish I can say
And make me feel like a child again
Bring back all those memories
And make me feel like a child again
With the feeling that I get
I don't even mind if we get wet
And if I drift outside myself
Please don't turn away
I'm searching for the innocence
I've lost along the way
Come join me in my fantasy
Step out of space and time
There's only one thing left to do
So if you wouldn't mind
And make me feel like a child again
Bring back all those memories
And make me feel like a child again
With the feeling that I get
I don't even mind if I get wet
And make me feel like a child again
Bring back all those memories
And make me feel like a child again
With the feeling that I get
I don't even mind if I get wet
With the feeling that I get
Out on the street anybody you meet got a heartache of their own
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we never let it end
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't want to hear your goodbye
Little by little we meet in the middle
There's danger in the dark
Make it a crime to out in the cold
You battle on with the love you're building on
It's got be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we never let it end
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't want to hear your goodbye
Don't want to hear your goodbye
I don't want to hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Don't want to hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place
I kiss the morning goodbye
You know we never know why
The road is narrow and long
And the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
But I give you it all
To get you into my world
It's a right I'll defend
With you eternally mine
We planned it all at the start
Live in each other's hearts
We may be oceans away
No truth is ever a lie
But I give you it all
To get you into my world
It's a right I'll defend
And I'm talking to you
It's a right I'll defend
To get you into my world
It's a right I'll defend
I wandered into your wonderland
You turned me into your yesterday
But you will remain inside of me
No one can hurt you now
For you are an island.
I may be broken but understand
My love they will try to care for me
No one can hurt you now
For you are an island.
No one can hurt you now
Are you close enough to take me to your paradise
Or am I going down to my loneliness
Could you be loving me more or less
Are you ready for the feeling
Can you learn to grow
I am the love don't let me die away
I am forever we are born to make
Out in a world where nights they don't ever end
I am the love don't let me die away
I am forever we are born to make
Out in a world where nights they don't ever ever end
I am the love don't let me die away
I am forever we are born to make
I am the love don't let me die away
I am forever we are born to make
So the word is goodbye
Makes no difference how the tears are cried
And my heart lives alone
I can make believe you need me
And we can't take it home
The fire that was burning
When all around was turning
And we were cruising for the ride
Got to give a little of the love inside
And we both played along
Love is easy on the young
As the world fades away
I'm losing you forever
I'm just an empty shell
With nothing for tomorrow
I'm here to face the sorrow
Got to give a little of the love inside
So the word is goodbye
Makes no difference how the tears are cried
And my heart lives alone
I can make believe you need me
And we can't take it home
The fire that is burning
When all around is turning
Got to give a little of the love inside
There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break
We let the heartache in
There was a world when we were standing still
And for a moment we were separated...
And then you found her
You let the stranger in
Forever more that's what we are to be
We'll be remembering when...
There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break
We let the heartache in
When someone is in your eyes...
Don't wanna stay here
Now you're cold as ice
From what you gave me
I should be homeward bound
Knowing your life story began with somebody else
Find your glory out there with somebody else
I'll be where you find me
I'll be somebody else
I see a stranger laughing in your eyes
Though I don't know how
No matter what you do
Knowing your life story began with somebody else
Find your glory out there with somebody else
I'll be where you find me
I'll be somebody else
Deeper than your valleys
Longer than your memory
I go to your stories end
Your life story began with somebody else
Find your glory out there with somebody else
I'll be where you find me
I'll be somebody else
I'm a mine of information
I'm a stranger to the cause
But the words I had are lost
Just wanna go down to be found
Wanna rise up in your flat
I wanna be everything you need babe
And I'm begging you to say in my heart
There's only a fool there
I will follow you home
How can you turn me away
Did you ever get hungry or thirsty
With a dream to satisfy
You don't wanna be safe from being lonely
But you're throat is kinda dry
Did you ever get senseless or defenseless
An exception to the rule
Whatever it takes to make you belong there
Love knows no other way
Being together and hearing you say you'll be mine
And I'll be forever yours
Did you ever get hungry or thirsty
With a dream to satisfy
But you're throat is kinda dry
Did you ever get senseless or defenseless
An exception to the rule
There's only a fool there
I will follow you home
How can you turn me away
I will follow you home
Didn't I like to hold you in my hand
I was doing you no harm
I made you understand
All my life I've been that way
Didn't I pray to love you through the night
I was dreaming wide awake
The early morning light shine on me
My heart has told me so
And the storm clouds gather overhead
No shelter we can share
Lie down on my flower bed
And the heat is stronger
For the moment when we touch
Come from loving you too much
And the nights are longer
Make it like a memory
Make it like a dream unreal
Make it like we never met
Make it like a memory
Take away the sound and the sight
There'll never be another love
Maybe I'm wrong to hold you in my hand
I believed you when you lied
I tried to understand
Make it like a memory
Make it like a dream unreal
Make it like we never ever met
Make it like a memory
Take away the sound and the sight
There'll never be another love
Midnight not a sound from the pavement
And the wind begins to moan
I can dream of the old days
Life was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in.
And a new day will begin
Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
Another day is dawning...
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun...
You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When I come through the door at the end of the day...
I remember when you couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after loving me late at night
And you're feeling all right
When you just roll over and turn out the light...
And you don't bring me flowers anymore
It used to be so natural
To talk about forever
They just lay on the floor
Till we sweep them away
And baby I remember all the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh and I learned how to cry
So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye
So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye
You don't bring me flowers any more...
You don't sing me love songs
My heart has gone to sleep
My heart belongs to me.
My heart belongs to me.
But we knew what had to be
But my heart belongs to me.
Put out the light and close your eyes
My heart belongs to me.
But my heart belongs to me.
My heart belongs to me.
Rain is clean and new
New is the morning and morning dew
Wet is a kiss that touches you
Sea is mysterious blue
Blue is for sadness and sad is for crying
Would you share these things with me
And let the tears fall as they wade
I'm not afraid of melt in the rain
I'm not afraid to be lost at sea
I'm not afraid to cry again
Because it's tears of joy
Would you share these things with me
And let the tears fall as they wade
Love that's flowing free
Free is the feeling I feel deep inside me
Some folks like to get away
Take a holiday from the neighborhood
Seen all those movie stars
And their fancy cars and their limousines
And I don't wanna waste more time
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
Comes down to reality
I don't have any reasons
I've left them all behind
I don't have any reasons
Cause left them all behind
I'll tell you a story
Every mountain and stream
That lives in my dream
Maybe someday he will happen to you
It's like he's always watching over me
I do believe in magic
When it's plain to see
Maybe someday he will happen to you
Softly he whispers into my ear
Softly he whispers into my ear
Take me in your dreams
Please don't leave me waiting here
Softly he whispers into my ear
But I don't wanna hear... I don't wanna hear
The last time I cried
I was holding you and loving you
You're the one I love
And what makes it sad
Is you don't belong to me
I was holding you and telling you
We could still be friends
And even though I'm not with you
But you don't belong to me
When there are so many nights
I can't hold you and I've told you
These feelings are so hard to find
I just can't get you out of my mind
But I can remember the last time we tried
Each needing more than we could give
And knowing all the time
Even though at times this crazy world
I remember sitting on the front steps
Feeling the softness of a warm summer rain
I see the reflections of my mind
All the sadness all the pain
How fast they slip away
And though my dreams have come and gone
With one wish I can say
And make me feel like a child again
Bring back all those memories
And make me feel like a child again
With the feeling that I get
I don't even mind if we get wet
And if I drift outside myself
Please don't turn away
I'm searching for the innocence
I've lost along the way
Come join me in my fantasy
Step out of space and time
There's only one thing left to do
So if you wouldn't mind
And make me feel like a child again
Bring back all those memories
And make me feel like a child again
With the feeling that I get
I don't even mind if I get wet
And make me feel like a child again
Bring back all those memories
And make me feel like a child again
With the feeling that I get
I don't even mind if I get wet
With the feeling that I get
And love is in the wind
Like some music in a dream
You made them all come true
When you came inside of my life
And lost in your eyes
I could spend all of my time
Hearing songs you sing
Feeling love you bring
Darling being close to you
Made all my dreams come true
When you came inside my life
So the word is goodbye
Makes no difference how the tears are cried
And my heart lives alone
I can make believe you need me
And we can't take it home
The fire that was burning
When all around was turning
And we were cruising for the ride
Got to give a little of the love inside
And we both played along
Love is easy on the young
As the world fades away
I'm losing you forever
I'm just an empty shell
With nothing for tomorrow
I'm here to face the sorrow
Got to give a little of the love inside
So the word is goodbye
Makes no difference how the tears are cried
And my heart lives alone
I can make believe you need me
And we can't take it home
The fire that is burning
When all around is turning
Got to give a little of the love inside
Light the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
Can it be that it was all so simple then
If we had the chance to do it all again
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply to choose to forget
I'm wrapped in a robe of light
Clothed in your glory
That spreads it's wings over my soul.
There's not a morning I begin without
That I don't try to find the reason
And the logic in the world that God designed.
What's right or wrong.
Within the scheme of things.
And why have eyes that see and arms that reach
If not to hunger for the meaning of it all.
Then why does my imagination sail
Who is also in heaven.
Of this flickering candle
Illuminate the night the way
Your spirit illuminates my soul.
I seem to see a million eyes
Where are you now that yesterday
The night is so much darker.
The wind is so much colder.
The world I see is so much bigger
Try to understand me.
Even though the night is filled
Can all the words in all the books
The trees are so much taller
And I feel so much smaller.
The moon is twice as lonely
And the stars are half as bright.
There are moments you remember all your life.
This is one of those moments.
To see me through the years
What my father learned and his
Father before him will be there
For my eyes and ears.
I can walk through the forests
Of the trees of knowledge
And listen to the lessons of the leaves.
Were there are rooms within rooms
Wrapped in the shawl that learning weaves.
Look at what it's brought me
There are certain things that once you have
No time can wear away...
I can open doors and take from the shelves
All the books I've longed to hold
The whys and the where's
As the mysteries of life unfold
Like a link in a chain
From the past to the future
There are certain things that once you have
There are moments you remember all your life.
There are moments you wait for
Her thought is to please him.
Before he even knows that he's hunger
She's already there with his plate.
Before his glass is even empty
Before he has the chance to tell her
No trouble... No bother.
What else should she be
And why should she worry
When she gets up her biggest decision
Is figuring out what to wear.
And then there's the problem of what
Should she do with her hair.
And later as she stands and studies
It's perfect this way
Who wouldn't want someone
Whose only aim in life is to serve you
There's no chill and yet I shiver
There's no flame and yet I burn
I'm not sure what I'm afraid of
And yet I'm trembling
There's no storm yet I hear thunder
And I'm breathless why I wonder
Weak one moment then the next I'm fine
I feel as if I'm falling
Every time I close my eyes
And flowing through my body
Is a river of surprise
Feelings are awakening
I hardly recognize as mine
What are all these new sensations
What's the secret they reveal
I'm not sure I understand
But I like the way I feel
Oh why why why why oh
Why is it that every time
I close my eyes he's there
The sunlight in his hair
And all the while I'm thinking things
That I can never share with him
I'm a bundle of confusion
Yet it has a strange appeal
Did it all begin with him
And the way he makes me feel
She never disputes him.
The conversation's not too exciting
To spend an evening where there's no conversation
With ribbons and laces
I must admit it's all very pleasant
And if he likes the smell of lilacs and roses
Then maybe he likes her perfume.
And thought her silky hair
And milky complexion are nice
Still they're not that distracting.
How could he resist her
No wonder he wants her.
I ask too many questions.
It seems this little game I play
And place a ring upon her hand
With her all dressed in white
I don't know how this came about
But I'll be wed without a doubt.
Somebody wake me up and say
Look how easily I fool them
They may have eyes but they don't see
They never really look at me
It might be interesting to know
Just how much further I can go
I can't believe what I'll presume to be
I'm not the bride but I'm the groom to be
And that's a monumental trick
I'd better think of something quick
Go anywhere or any place
Where no one knows my face.
I don't know just so I can
But there's someone I would miss
But something tells me that I'm right
Things may not be as they appear
And I've reasons to think she likes me.
I keep things as they were
Who'd have ever predicted
The moment would come
When I'd find myself grateful
She's an innocent maiden
That's why it's possible I could get by.
For I feel like a train on a perilous track.
With no way to stop and no way to go back.
Going faster and faster and faster until...
Even if someone would pray for me
That they could say for me
Look at how he looks at her
Full of all the feelings and the soft
Although I've sat and studied him for hours.
But now I see how love completely occupies
Like slaves they follow every where she goes.
Do my eyes forget themselves
And do I ever look at him
And smile in such a way
Sometimes I have the feeling
Still I can't help wondering
If I'll ever live to see the day
I can never look at her that way...
Full of all the feelings and the soft
Unspoken words that lovers say...
I wish there were a way to say that
Isn't written anywhere
And I'm supposed to be the one
I can never be what she
Afraid it saw too much.
The moon had the one light
I held in my feelings
And closed every door.
No matter what happens.
There's someone who must hear
The words I've never spoken.
Tonight if he were here
My silence would be broken.
The same heart that tells me
For too many mornings
The curtains were drawn.
It's time they were opened
I can't keep it quiet any longer.
It can't be the same anymore...
I promise it won't be the same
Of them wiser and better for having
She's the wonder of wonders
It all began the day I found
I never dreamed it was so wide
Or even half as high.
The things you can't imagine
If you've never flown at all.
Sometimes where danger lies
There the sweetest of pleasures are found.
But there will also be
More to question yet more to believe.
Where is the someone who will turn to look at me
Each mile I travel only means
The more I have to go.
There's no chill and yet I shiver
There's no flame and yet I burn
I'm not sure what I'm afraid of
And yet I'm trembling
There's no storm yet I hear thunder
And I'm breathless why I wonder
Weak one moment then the next I'm fine
I feel as if I'm falling
Every time I close my eyes
And flowing through my body
Is a river of surprise
Feelings are awakening
I hardly recognize as mine
What are all these new sensations
What's the secret they reveal
I'm not sure I understand
But I like the way I feel
Oh why why why why oh
Why is it that every time
I close my eyes he's there
The sunlight in his hair
And all the while I'm thinking things
That I can never share with him
I'm a bundle of confusion
Yet it has a strange appeal
Did it all begin with him
And the way he makes me feel
I can never look at her that way...
Full of all the feelings and the soft
Unspoken words that lovers say...
I wish there were a way to say that
Isn't written anywhere
And I'm supposed to be the one
I can never be what she
Afraid it saw too much.
The moon had the one light
I held in my feelings
And closed every door.
No matter what happens.
There's someone who must hear
The words I've never spoken.
Tonight if he were here
My silence would be broken.
The same heart that tells me
For too many mornings
The curtains were drawn.
It's time they were opened
I can't keep it quiet any longer.
It can't be the same anymore...
I promise it won't be the same
Face in the mirror looks the same
Every morning I keep looking for a change
Sometimes I wonder am I standing still in time
Tired of doing everything the same old way.
Tired of playing all the games that people play
This running round in circles gives me no piece of mind
I need to laugh sometimes
Need to feel each passing day go by
I need to love so hard I don't know what to do
Sometimes I need a good old fashioned fight
It doesn't matter If I'm wrong or right
Please don't worry about it
You know how much I care
Sometimes I need to make love all day long
Sometimes I need to hold you in my arms
Let's drift away together
It doesn't matter where
I need to laugh sometimes
I need to love so hard I don't know what to do
Sometimes I need to tear the whole thing down
Sometimes I need to turn it all around
When I put it back together
I'll be calling out to you
Don't call him up anymore
He only knows how I feel
I only know what he's like
Don't get to close when you dance
You were out on the town
I don't wanna know where he goes
Don't call him up anymore
I remember when my voice was never heard
Many listened but they never heard the words
In my mind I can travel back in time
Relive the memories that kept my faith alive
In every heart there's a time machine
If you believe in your memory
Trace every place you've been
You'll know what it means
In every heart beats a time machine
Where you can be what you want to be
You can relive your life
Looking back on all the changes I have made
I may have stumbled but I never lost my way
Now I feel all the world is on my side
When I remember there's
A special place inside
In every heart there's a time machine
If you believe in your memory
Trace every place you've been
You know what it means
In every heart beats a time machine
Where you can be what you want to be
You can relive your life
Now that your eyes are open
You can explore each moment
For you are the only one
I can't apologize for the way I feel
I've loved you the best I could
In the only way I knew
And I'm not even sure that I would
But I've loved you the best I could
I need more... I need someone to hold me tonight
Someone there when I turn out the lights
Just to be here with me
I need more than you somehow
I need more than your time will allow
I want you as my friend
The times I needed you
Then you'd hold me and say you're sorry
Yet I know you really loved me
So it's hard to let go like I should
Cause you loved me the best you could
I need someone to hold me tonight
Someone there when I turn out the light
Just to be here with me
I need more than your time will allow
Remember the times that were good
Why did you let it begin
What did she whisper and
Do you think it will stop
Did you get to try anything... new
Who made the very first move...
You don't have to sneak in the doorway
Just come on into the room
I've been lying in our bed in the dark all alone
There's been no reason to move
It's been as still as a tomb
I needed you oh so badly tonight
But I guess you had better things to do
I should have known that it was coming to this
But I must have been blind
I bet you still got a trace of her love in your eyes
And you've still got her eyes on your mind
You swore you'd be with me at 7 o'clock
Now it's a quarter to 3
And whatever you got and whoever it was
I guess you couldn't get it from me
Whatever you got and whoever it was
I guess you couldn't get it from me
I know that you love me
There's no need to talk
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof
And there are no lies on your body
As I see you undress ooh
I just want to get at the truth
I know that you love me
There's no need to talk
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof
And there are no lies on your body
As I watch you undress
I just want to get at the truth
There are so many thing that I've just just gotta know
I just need some love so turn out the lights and
I'll be left in the dark again
I'll be left in the dark again
I'll be left in the dark again
Left in the dark again
I should have known that it was coming to this
But I must have been blind
I bet you still got a trace of her love in you eyes
And you still got her eyes on your mind
You swore you'd be with me at 7 o'clock
Now it's a quarter to 3
And whatever you got and whoever it was
I guess you couldn't get it from me
I guess you couldn't get it from me
I know that you love me
There's no need to talk
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof
And there are no lies on your body
As I watch you undress ooh
I just want to get at the truth
And there are so many things
That I've just got to know
I don't need any answers tonight...
I just need some love so turn out the lights and
I'll be left in the dark again
I just need some love
So turn out the lights and I'll be left in the dark again
I just need some love
So turn out the lights and I'll be left in the dark again
I just need some love
So turn out the lights and I'll be left in the dark again
I just need some love
So turn out the light and I'll be left in the dark again
I just need some love
So turn out the lights and I'll be left in the dark again...
It makes no sense to stay
Living my life in yesterday
Heart don't change my mind
Oh heart be strong this time
And try to help me tell him goodbye
It'll only bring pain for us to stay
Don't let me think about how good it was before
I know you'd try anything to keep me from that door
Its hard to leave him when you've loved him for so long now
How can I walk away if he's still holding on now
I've found the strength today
Look at me I can finally say
Heart don't change my mind
Oh heart be strong this time
And try to help me tell him goodbye
It'll only bring pain for us to stay
It makes no sense to stay
Sad that it has to end this way
Heart don't change my mind
Oh heart be strong this time
And try to help me tell him goodbye
It'll only bring pain for us to stay
In a world that has no time
In a world that pays no mind
To a heart such as mine
Out along the stars somewhere
All alone without a care
All I want to do is find what
Knowing that there must be more
I imagine when I dream
What I've never known
All at once I am free
On the sky or on the ground
Of the earth but not earthbound
Thinking back it seems I've
Sacrificing what I felt inside
Never thought I could have in my life
The dreams I have denied
I believe there's someone there
Someone else with dreams to share
Someone willing to care
Out among the stars somewhere
That I can't begin to see
There's no voice telling me
Out among the stars somewhere
For beyond the fantasy
And the harsh reality
Out along the stars somewhere
All alone without a care
You are a step in the right direction
You are a step forward for me
You are a step in the right direction
We blow hot and cold right into
I come toward you and you back away
Don't let the world get in out way
You are a step in the right direction
You are a step forward for me
You are a step in the right direction
Our lives are filled with such indecision
Don't run away don't avoid the collision
Let the sparks fill up our days
It's a step in the right direction
You are a step in the right direction
You are a step forward for me
You are a step in the right direction
But don't push your luck honey
May not be love and it may not be perfect
It may not make our dreams come true
Can't put your arms around them
Let me put my arms around you
You are a step in the right direction
You are a step forward for me
You are a step in the right direction
You are a step forward for me
I am a step forward for you
I am a step in the right direction
Come on and take a step or two
Like a bottle on a stormy sea
Somehow out fortunes crossed
You reached out and rescued me
Like the dark before the dawn
I was only waiting for you to come along
It's gonna be clear sailing
And I used to spend the night
And the night was like an ocean
I was caught up in the tides
Held me like a lifeline
Oh it's gonna be clear sailing
With a dream to sail on
Clear sailing from now on
Now I look into your eyes
The color of a quiet sea
Cast my love up on the tide
Watch it return to me
I can tell the storm has passed
It's gonna be clear sailing
Oh it's gonna be clear sailing
With a dream to sail on
Running from the past
Secrets from the heart
Until the dawn breaks
I can't remember feeling this familiar
I see myself becoming his
It frightens me to learn
No place left to hide
I can't remember feeling this familiar
I feel myself becoming his
It strengthens me to finally see that
The actors have unmasked
Each day for lovers who
Have never come this far
Every moment makes a contribution
Every little detail plays a parts
Having just a vision's no solution
Everything depends on execution
First of all you need a good foundation
Otherwise it's risky from the start
Takes a little cocktail conversation
But without the proper preparation
Having just a vision's no solution
Everything depends on execution
The art of making art
Learning how to play the politician
Otherwise you'll find your composition
Isn't gonna get much exhibition
Every minor detail is a major decision
Have to keep things in scale
Have to hold to your vision
What's a little cocktail conversation
If it gets the funds for your foundation
Every time I start to feel defensive
Still if you remember your objective
Not give all your privacy away
A little bit of hype can be effective
As long as you can keep it in perspective
Even when you get some recognition
Everything you do you still audition
Overnight you're a trend
You're the right combination
Then the trend's at an end
All they ever want is repetition
All they really like is what they know
Gotta keep a link with your tradition
Gotta learn to trust your intuition
So that you can be on exhibit...
All it takes is time and perseverance
With a little luck along the way
Putting in a personal appearance
Gathering supporters and adherents...
Harmonizing each negotiation
Balancing the part that's all musicians
With the part that's strictly presentation
Balancing the money with the mission
Till you have the perfect orchestration
Even if you do have the suspicion
That it's taking all your concentration
The art of making art
All I'd want you to know
Round in circles I'd go
I'd let my golden chances
There's something due any day
It's only just out of reach
I got a feeling there's a miracle due
I don't know what it is
But it is gonna be great
Maybe just by holding still
And something great is coming
And something great is coming
It's only just out of reach
Demons are prowling everywhere
No one's gonna hurt you
Others can desert you
Being close and being clever
Ain't like being true
I would never hide a thing from you
No one's gonna hurt you
Others can desert you
Someone to hold you too close
Someone to hurt you too deep
Someone to sit in your chair
And make you aware of being alive
Someone to need you too much
Someone to know you too well
And put you through hell
Somebody hold me too close
Somebody force me to care
Somebody make me come through
As frightened as you of being alive
Someone you have to let in
Someone whose feelings you spare
Somebody crowd me with love
Somebody force me to care
Somebody make me com through
As frightened as you to help us survive
We hide from the moon
What a joy you'll be...
Every word you whisper
We speak in a whisper
Afraid to be heard...
In the glow of evening
To kiss in the sunlight
That by now I think I know
What it's like to be loved by you
Behold how my lover loves me...
He will not always say
What you would have him say
But now and then he'll say
The thoughtless things he'll do
Will hurt and worry you
Then all at once he'll do
He has a thousand dreams
You know that he believes in them
And that's enough for you.
You'll always go along
Defend him when he's wrong
He'll always need your love
A man who needs your love
It says here in this book
The average unmarried female
Due to some long frustration
With psychosomatic symptoms
Affecting the upper respiratory tract
Just from waiting around
For that plain little band of gold
A person can develop a cold
You can spray her wherever you figure
The streptococci lurk
You can give her a shot
For whatever she's got
But it just won't work
The female remaining single
Just in the legal sense
Shows a neurotic tendency
You can feed her all day
But the medicine never
If she's getting a kind
And stalling and stalling
Can develop La grippe
When they get on a train
And she can hear church bells chime
The compartment is air conditioned
Then they get off at Saratoga
For the fourteenth time
Can develop La grippe
From a lack of community property
And a feeling she's getting too old
Just when I stopped opening doors
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair
But where are the clowns
There ought to be clowns
Quick send in the clowns
I've come to feel about you what you felt about me
Why only now when I see that you've drifted away
Losing my timing this late in my career
And where are the clowns
Quick send in the clowns
Sitting in the window or
Standing on the stair
Something in them cheers the air
Glancing stay forever
Blowing out their candles or
Combing out their hair
Here's to the ladies who lunch
Lounging in their caftans and
Here's to the girls who just watch
It's a bottle of scotch
Another chance to disapprove
Another brilliant zinger
Another reason not to move
Another vodka stinger
Here's to the girls who play wife
Just to keep in touch
The ones who follow the rules
And meet themselves at the schools
Too busy to know that they're fools
Let's all drink to...
How they make a man sing...
A toast to that invincible bunch
The dinosaurs surviving the crunch
Let's hear it for the ladies who lunch
Pretty women at their mirrors
Window shopping table hopping
Pretty women giving parties
And I can't tell you why
There is no reason why I should love that man
I gotta love one man till I die
And when he comes back that day is fine
He can come home as late as can be
Home without him ain't no home to me
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
With you forever and I'd be glad
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
He's gonna handle me and hold me so
But when he calls I know I have to go
Because the sorrow of the past is all
Now the real happiness is just begun
There's no wrinkle on my brow
And summer time and winter time
We'll find a new way of living
Will find a way of forgiving
There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
There's a time for us
Someday there'll be a time for us
Time together and time to spare
We'll find a new way of living
Will find there's a way of forgiving
There's a place for us
A time and a place for us
Hold my hand and we're half way there
Just hold my hand and I'll take you there
Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
Wanting far too much for far too long.
Looking back I could have played it differently
One of few more moments who can tell
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know I know him well.
But in the end he needs
A little bit more than me
More she needs security
He needs his fantasy and freedom
No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side
And though I move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide.
Looking back I could have played it differently
Could have played things some other way.
Learn about the man before I fell
I was just a little careless
But I was ever so much younger then.
I was so much younger then
Now at least I know I know him well
If I knew from the start
But in the end he needs a little bit more than me
More she needs security
He needs his Fantasy and freedom
It took time to understand me
We'll find a new way of living
Will find a way of forgiving
There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
There's a time for us
Someday there'll be a time for us
Time together and time to spare
We'll find a new way of living
Will find there's a way of forgiving
There's a place for us
A time and a place for us
Hold my hand and we're half way there
Just hold my hand and I'll take you there
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you
Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
You and I will make each night a first
Every day a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
Two lights that shine as one
Morning glory and midnight sun
Time we've learned to sail above
Time won't change the meaning of one love
There's something due any day
It's only just out of reach
I got a feeling there's a miracle due
I don't know what it is
But it is gonna be great
Maybe just by holding still
And something great is coming
And something great is coming
It's only just out of reach
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children
Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people
People who need people
Just when I stopped opening doors
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair
But where are the clowns
There ought to be clowns
Quick send in the clowns
I've come to feel about you what you felt about me
Why only now when I see that you've drifted away
Losing my timing this late in my career
And where are the clowns
Quick send in the clowns
Heaven opens a magic lane.
When all the clouds darken up the skyway
There's a rainbow highway to be found
Leading from your window pane
To a place behind the sun
Just a step beyond the rain
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me...
That's where you'll find me...
Birds fly over the rainbow
If all those little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow...
Out on the street anybody you meet got a heartache of their own
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we never let it end
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't want to hear your goodbye
Little by little we meet in the middle
There's danger in the dark
Make it a crime to out in the cold
You battle on with the love you're building on
It's got be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we never let it end
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't want to hear your goodbye
Don't want to hear your goodbye
I don't want to hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Don't want to hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of
There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break
We let the heartache in
There was a world when we were standing still
And for a moment we were separated...
And then you found her
You let the stranger in
Forever more that's what we are to be
We'll be remembering when...
There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break
We let the heartache in
When someone is in your eyes...
Who is also in heaven.
Of this flickering candle
Illuminate the night the way
Your spirit illuminates my soul.
I seem to see a million eyes
Where are you now that yesterday
The night is so much darker.
The wind is so much colder.
The world I see is so much bigger
Try to understand me.
Even though the night is filled
Can all the words in all the books
The trees are so much taller
And I feel so much smaller.
The moon is twice as lonely
And the stars are half as bright.
Light the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
Can it be that it was all so simple then
If we had the chance to do it all again
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply to choose to forget
It's a new world I see
The tears have rolled off my cheek
Though we're in a tiny room
And blossom and bloom
You bring a new world to me
We are rid of you at last
You are now a thing of the past
Happy days are here again
The skies above are clear again
So let's sing a song of cheer again
Happy days are here again
Altogether shout it now
So let's tell the world about it now
Happy days are here again
Your cares and troubles are gone
There'll be no more from now on
Happy days are here again
The skies above are here again
For purple mountain majesties
And crown thy good with brotherhood
And MERCY more than life
For purple mountain majesties
And crown thy good with brotherhood
It was raining when I met you
No time to be impressed
I remember so much later on
I knew that you were someone
You know too many hearts are in a rush
No matter how you try to
The places you find love
The need to find the place
Where feeling can be safe
It's not money that buys happiness
The clock is always running and
No one ever seems to have enough
And when you least expect it
Remember in a flash the feeling can hit you
After all the times that it missed you
Look around you notice you're flying
And for once you're not even trying
It's a river never stopping
But you should never doubt
There's no way to fight it
Let it carry you away
Everybody's dreaming waiting for the feeling
That moment when they finally rise above
But it's always in the giving
Remember in the poorest part of town
Where the sun never reaches the ground
And seeing's not believing
Little children laughing and playing
Remember in a flash the feeling can hit you
After all the times that it missed you
Look around you notice you're flying
And for once you're not even trying
City lights below you
Like a million tiny stars
In the poorest part of town
Where the sun never reaches the ground
Seeing's not believing
Little children laughing and playing
In a flash the feeling can hit you
After all the times that it missed you
Look around you notice you're flying
And for once you're not even trying
City lights below you like a million tiny stars
In the poorest part of town
Where the sun never reaches the ground
And seeing's not believing
So often as I wait for sleep
I find myself reciting
The words I've or should have said
Like scenes that need rewriting
The smiles I never answered
Doors perhaps I should have opened
Songs forgotten in the morning
I relive the roles I've played
The tears I may have squandered
The many pipers I have paid
Along the roads I've wandered
Yet all the time I knew it
Love was somewhere out there waiting
Though I may regret a kiss or two
If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray
I may have never found my way to you
If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray
I may have never found my way to you
I wouldn't change a thing that happened
And sometimes I would wonder
Could the one to save me
I held you close to my heart
But I never thought that I'd feel the way I do
Until that certain moment when I loved you
And now I can't ever imagine
My living without you
It seems I spend all of my time
Thinking only about you
Once I dreamed in a dream I would find you
Never thought that the dream would come true
Until that certain moment when I loved you
Until that certain moment
Certain moment when I loved you
Make it last this time
That there's no rehearsal
If we learn to tell the truth
And to trust each other
And be unafraid of what we'll see
With time and love we learn
When we accept each other
That's when our lives can come together
If it lasts this time
Then the shadows of the past will remain
And finally we will be free
With time and love we learn
We have this chance to grow
We have this chance to know each other
All of the love inside us
And then our lives will come together
I know with time and love
Shine on both of us tonight
No more talk of darkness
My words will warm and calm you
Let me be your freedom
Let daylight dry your tears
To guard you and to guide you
Say you love me every winter morning
Turn my head with talk of summertime
Say you need me with you now and always
Promise me that all you say is true
That's all I ask of you
Let me be your shelter
Your fears are far behind you
All I want is freedom
A world with no more night
To hold me and to hide me
Let me lead you from your solitude
Christine that's all I ask of you
Say the word and I will follow you
That's all I ask of you
How grateful my heart feels
Knowing that you've come
Now I know my life has finally begun
Now when the world around me looks gray
I look into your eyes and all the darkness goes
Finally I know I'm never alone
A light inside will lead me home
Remember it's all there is
Remember it's all there was
The answer is right here in our hands
And know if our hearts are true
There's nothing we have to do
You and me for always
Now when I wake each morning I say
No need to look ahead
Leave the past behind
Here's a brand new day
Suddenly my life is perfectly clear
The love we found was always here
Remember it's all there is
Remember it's all there was
The answer is right here in our hands
And know if our hearts are true
There's nothing we have to do
You and me for always
The answer is here in our hands
You and me for always
The answer is here in our hands
You smiled and you were in my life
I saw my dreams there in your eyes
You held me through the night
It's filled with clouds and stormy skies
But if we really care
When what we have is so worth fighting for
We can hide our feelings less
So we can love each other more
I know that when I'm in your arms
There's no such thing as good goodbyes
A love of heart and mind
We can hide our feelings less
So we can love each other more
Frightened of new places
Somehow afraid of love
Playing in the sunlight
Games we play too well
Time we throw all our toys away
So that our love can grow
We're two people trying to leave
Ready to find the love that will last
Are you the one who can free
Where did we go wrong
Where does my heart belong
We held on to our pride
When we left each other
But what good is pride tonight
Why did we give up on us so fast
Isn't love supposed to last
What were we thinking of
Looking for something better
Reaching for more than love
What were we thinking of
Too late we both discovered
We're lost without each other
What were we thinking of
Wanting just to call you
Knowing my heart would break
And you will never answer
The saddest part of all
Is I know you're there
What were we thinking of
Looking for something better
Reaching for more than love
What were we thinking of
Too late we both discovered
We're lost without each other
What were we thinking of
What were we thinking of
Looking for something better
Reaching for more than love
What were we thinking of
Too late we both discovered
We're lost without each other
What were we thinking of
What were we thinking of
Looking for something better
Reaching for more than love
What were we thinking of
Too late we both discovered
We're lost without each other
What were we thinking of
What were we thinking of
What were we thinking of
And all that I wanted was to be with you tonight
I've watched love get closer and then fade away
But what good is holding on when you know
That all you can think about is letting go
They say if you love someone then set them free
If they'll come back again then in the end
I thought we were lovers
I thought we were friends
I guess when reality steps in the dreaming ends
We live for the future
We learn from the past
No matter how hard we try some good things never last.
All you can think about is letting go
Be true to yourself my love
That's all I ever wanted you to be
Just don't forget to smile
When you think of me.
I've reached for the star
I have got them insight
There's someone who really needs me
Out there in the night
We live for the future
We learn from the past
No matter how hard we try
It was over we had gone
There was no one we could blame
People told me love will come again
When you least expect it
It will lift you up the way it did back then
Thought it couldn't happen
And even when I had said next time
I'll never give my heart
Like a light inside you
Someone's going to come along
Go for one more time around
One more time like the old times
I still feel so much inside me
Maybe I'll make it better next time
It all depends on what I find
Guess relationships are hard to say the least
But I've got to try and get it right
Or I'll only end up like the others
Who get stranded in the night
So I'm going to do it
Go for one more time around
One more time like the old times
I still feel so much inside me
Maybe I'll make it better next time
It all depends on what I find
With just one more time around
One more time like the old times
I still feel so much inside me
Maybe we'll make it better next time
It all depends if you and I
Go for one more time around
One more time like the old times
I still feel so much inside me
Maybe I'll make it better next time
It all depends on what I find
But in our hearts we know it's not the same...
Are memories of a dream we used to know...
Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place
I kiss the morning goodbye
You know we never know why
The road is narrow and long
And the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
But I give you it all
To get you into my world
It's a right I'll defend
With you eternally mine
We planned it all at the start
Live in each other's hearts
We may be oceans away
No truth is ever a lie
But I give you it all
To get you into my world
It's a right I'll defend
And I'm talking to you
It's a right I'll defend
To get you into my world
It's a right I'll defend
No more talk of darkness
My words will warm and calm you
Let me be your freedom
Let daylight dry your tears
To guard you and to guide you
Say you love me every winter morning
Turn my head with talk of summertime
Say you need me with you now and always
Promise me that all you say is true
That's all I ask of you
Let me be your shelter
Your fears are far behind you
All I want is freedom
A world with no more night
To hold me and to hide me
Let me lead you from your solitude
Christine that's all I ask of you
Say the word and I will follow you
That's all I ask of you
The last time I cried
I was holding you and loving you
You're the one I love
And what makes it sad
Is you don't belong to me
I was holding you and telling you
We could still be friends
And even though I'm not with you
But you don't belong to me
When there are so many nights
I can't hold you and I've told you
These feelings are so hard to find
I just can't get you out of my mind
But I can remember the last time we tried
Each needing more than we could give
And knowing all the time
Even though at times this crazy world
There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break
We let the heartache in
There was a world when we were standing still
And for a moment we were separated...
And then you found her
You let the stranger in
Forever more that's what we are to be
We'll be remembering when...
There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break
We let the heartache in
When someone is in your eyes...
I gotta thank my luck stars above
We got a first rate act
It's evident when we make love
You're my every thought
You're my own attraction
You must be heaven's saint
You give me so much satisfaction
You make life worth fighting for
And there is nobody quite like you
I gotta thank my luck stars above
We got a first rate act
It's evident when we make love
And it's my conclusion
There is no sweeter scent
When you have found the right solution
You make life worth fighting for
And there is nobody quite like you
I gotta thank my luck stars above
We got a first rate act
It's evident when we make love
Fight for what you want
Fight for what you need
Fight to keep the one you love
With love you might succeed
Fight to keep the one you love
If love is what you feel
Don't try to kick me when I'm down
So put up your dukes and fight
Don't try to kick me when I'm down
My feet are planted on the ground
You're gonna give up without a sound
I'm a winner there's no denying
So put up your dukes and fight
We got a first rate act
It's evident when we make love...
I'm gonna thank my luck stars above
I'm gonna thank my luck stars above
There is no sweeter scent
When I've found the right solution
I've found the right solution
I'm gonna thank my lucky stars above
I'm gonna thank my lucky stars above
You make life worth fighting for
When I wake up each morning
Trying to find myself
And if I m ever the least unsure
I always remind myself
Though you re someone in this world
That I'll always choose to love
From now on you re only someone
It s getting down to the last
When you must begin to ease
The pain of a broken heart
Tell me why should I even care
If I have to lose your love
From now on you re only someone
I wish it was enough for you
All the love I had to give
To keep you satisfied
I guess you ll never know
And if ever our paths
Neath the one to get lost again
Once I had so much to give
But you just refused my love
From now on you re only someone
To keep you satisfied
I guess you ll never know
When I wake up each morning
Trying to find myself
And if I m ever the least unsure
I always remind myself
Though you re someone in this world
That all always choose to love
From now on you re only someone
From now on you re only someone
Though you re someone in this world
That I'll always choose to love
From now on you re only someone
From now on you re only someone
By the way did I hear you say
If some night I seem too lonely
Have I told you yet that only recently
Took the towels we stole
From some motel in Tennessee
He was gone long before he really left
Anyway that's all yesterday
If you try calling by and by
You don't look a thing like he did
And it's time to play
Why can't we make love fall
Out on the street anybody you meet got a heartache of their own
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we never let it end
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't want to hear your goodbye
Little by little we meet in the middle
There's danger in the dark
Make it a crime to out in the cold
You battle on with the love you're building on
It's got be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we never let it end
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't want to hear your goodbye
Don't want to hear your goodbye
I don't want to hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Don't want to hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Midnight not a sound from the pavement
And the wind begins to moan
I can dream of the old days
Life was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in.
And a new day will begin
Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
Another day is dawning...
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun...
There's no chill and yet I shiver
There's no flame and yet I burn
I'm not sure what I'm afraid of
And yet I'm trembling
There's no storm yet I hear thunder
And I'm breathless why I wonder
Weak one moment then the next I'm fine
I feel as if I'm falling
Every time I close my eyes
And flowing through my body
Is a river of surprise
Feelings are awakening
I hardly recognize as mine
What are all these new sensations
What's the secret they reveal
I'm not sure I understand
But I like the way I feel
Oh why why why why oh
Why is it that every time
I close my eyes he's there
The sunlight in his hair
And all the while I'm thinking things
That I can never share with him
I'm a bundle of confusion
Yet it has a strange appeal
Did it all begin with him
And the way he makes me feel
We'll find a new way of living
Will find a way of forgiving
There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
There's a time for us
Someday there'll be a time for us
Time together and time to spare
We'll find a new way of living
Will find there's a way of forgiving
There's a place for us
A time and a place for us
Hold my hand and we're half way there
Just hold my hand and I'll take you there
I still couldn't hide
For haven't I told you so
I speak your name in my every prayer.
If there is some other way
I swear I don't know how.
You'll never know if you don't know now.
I speak your name in my every prayer.
If there is some other way
In the palm of your hand
Can't believe what just passed
Sweet golden as a crown
I will walk with my feet off the ground
I will walk with my feet off the ground
Other girls get called by their first names right away
Even my first name would be preferable
You'd think at least miss m. they could try...
I'm a very willing secretary
Enjoy my work as my employer will corroborate
Except for one disappointment one fly in the ointment
It's great I mean simply great
But the aggravation of my situation
I might as well get it off my chest
It's the drab appellation
Oh pardon the big words I apply
With which I am persistently addressed
Other girls get called by their nick names right away
It's kind of crummy but chummy
Everyday I get more and more fussed
Music is a lot of men with a lot of tails making lots of noise like a lot of
Music is a lot of folks in a big dark hall where they really don't want to be
Nobody's heart belongs to me
No one belongs to me.
That's the least of my cares.
To go your own sweet way.
Nobody's arms belong to me
No arms feel strong to me.
You cried the lone night through
I cried a river over you
Now you say you're sorry
I cried a river over you
Nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me
Now you say you love me
I cried a river over you
Nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me
And now you say you love me
I cried a river over you
You better chase all your cares away
The skies above are clear again
Happy days are here again.
Shout it now there's no one
The lord is wait to take you're hand
So let's tell the world
We're going to the promise land
Happy days are here again.
We're heading cross the river
Sun you case when I'll be gone
There'll be no more from now on
You better chase all your cares away
The skies above are clear again
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children
Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people
People who need people
Father has a business strictly second hand
Everything from toothpicks to a baby grand
Stuff in our apartment came from father's store
Even things I'm wearing someone wore before
It's no wonder that I feel abused
I never get a thing that ain't been used
I'm wearing second hand hats
That's why they call me
Even our piano in the parlor
Father bought for ten cents on the dollar
Second hand pearls I'm sick of second hand curls
I never get a single thing that's new
Had the nerve to tell me he's been married before
Everyone knows that I'm just
Everyone knows that I'm just
Let's see if you know the fills
Through the Ritz a girl got my goat
Everyone knows that I'm just
And ten to one I'll win
Though you don't agree.
Though you don't agree
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain and deep as a river
Come rain or come shine
I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or were out of the money
Come rain or come shine
Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or were out of the money
But I'm with you always
What do I really hear
What is in the ear of my mind
Which sounds are true and clear
And which will never be defined
The sweetest sounds I'll ever hear
Are still inside my head
The kindest words I'll ever know
Are waiting to be said
The most and entrancing side of all
And the dearest love in all the world
Is waiting somewhere for me
At words poetic I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best
Instead of getting it off my chest
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar
But if this ditty is not so pretty
At least it'll tell you how great you are
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss.
You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain.
I'm a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop.
You're Inferno's Dante.
I'm the lazy lout who is just about to storm Let's not storm
What are you doing the rest of your life
East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me
All the seasons and the times of your days
Are the nickels and the dimes of your day
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me
I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of gold and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make
Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In a world of love you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two
Summer winter spring and fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
You're gonna leave me
I can see that faraway look in your eyes
The heart grow fonder
And that tears are on their way
You're gonna leave me
I can see that faraway look in your eyes
That it won't be long
When it all comes true
Just the way you planned
It's funny but the bells don't ring
When you hold the world
In your trembling hand.
You think you'd hear a choir singing
But it's a quiet thing.
There are no exploding fireworks
Where's the roaring of the crowds
Maybe it's the strange new atmosphere
Way up here among the clouds
There won't be trumpets or balls of fire
He may not be the cavalier
Doesn't matter just as long as he
But not with trumpets or lightning flashing
He has lots of hills to climb
And a hero doesn't come till
Don't look for trumpets or whistles tooting
You'll know him when you see him
I can't even say that I care
All I know is the minute you turn
And he's suddenly there
You won't need trumpets
There are no trumpets
Happiness comes in on tiptoe
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you
Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
You and I will make each night a first
Every day a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
Two lights that shine as one
Morning glory and midnight sun
Time we've learned to sail above
Time won't change the meaning of one love
There is more there is more than a day.
Between day and night between black and white
Between the question and the answer
There's the silence of the sea.
There is the someone that is me.
There is more there is more than a day.
And every thing you've ever known.
Between yesterday and tomorrow
There is more there is more than a day.
Between yesterday and tomorrow
There is more there is more than a day.
There's every plan you'll dare to make
And every dream you'll dare to dream.
Between yesterday and tomorrow.
You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When I come through the door at the end of the day...
I remember when you couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after loving me late at night
And you're feeling all right
When you just roll over and turn out the light...
And you don't bring me flowers anymore
It used to be so natural
To talk about forever
They just lay on the floor
Till we sweep them away
And baby I remember all the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh and I learned how to cry
So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye
So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye
You don't bring me flowers any more...
You don't sing me love songs
Who is also in Heaven
Of this flickering candle
Illuminate the night the way
Your spirit illuminates my soul
I seem to see a million eyes
Where are you now that yesterday
The night is so much darker
The wind is so much colder
The world I see is so much bigger
Can you hear me praying
Even though the night is filled
Can all the words in all the books
The trees are so much taller
And I feel so much smaller
The moon is twice as lonely
And the stars are half as bright
Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
Wanting far too much for far too long.
Looking back I could have played it differently
One of few more moments who can tell
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know I know him well.
But in the end he needs
A little bit more than me
More she needs security
He needs his fantasy and freedom
No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side
And though I move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide.
Looking back I could have played it differently
Could have played things some other way.
Learn about the man before I fell
I was just a little careless
But I was ever so much younger then.
I was so much younger then
Now at least I know I know him well
If I knew from the start
But in the end he needs a little bit more than me
More she needs security
He needs his Fantasy and freedom
It took time to understand me
You get me warm all over
Sometimes I feel kind of odd
But when I touch your hand
Goner are the clouds that
Used to swarm all over
Please always let me keep
With a tender love for you
Please always let me keep feeling
I still couldn't hide
For haven't I told you so
I speak your name in my every prayer.
If there is some other way
I swear I don't know how.
You'll never know if you don't know now.
I speak your name in my every prayer.
If there is some other way
You may see a stranger
Across a crowded room
That somewhere you'll see him
Some enchanted evening
Across a crowded room
As strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter
Will sing in your dreams.
Some enchanted evening
And make her your own
For all through your life you
Don't walk on the grass
Don't disturb the peace
Don't skate on the ice
And if you fail you fail
Don't get out of line
When they say that then
Nine times out of ten
Lady your doing just fine
Sometimes you have to start small
Climbing the tiniest wall
Maybe your going to fall
But it's better than not starting at all
Everybody says can't fight city hall
Can't upset the court
Can't laugh at the king
Laugh at the king till it makes you cry
But lady make a noise
That's the way the world is made
Heightens each sensation...
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination.
Silently the senses abandon their defenses
Helpless to resist the notes I write
Night unfurls its splendor.
There you trust the music of the night...
And the truth isn't what you want to see.
In the dark it is easy to pretend
That the truth is what it ought to be...
Music shall caress you.
Secretly posses you...
The darkness of the music of the night...
Close your eyes start a journey through a strange new world
Only then can you belong to me...
Let your darker side give in
Help me make the music of the night...
Our summer day withers away
That tomorrow is near
Oh please just don't say no to me
I don't know why I'm frightened
I know my way around here
But I'm not in any hurry
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always
Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
I've spent so many mornings
Just trying to resist you
We were young together.
Not long until the camera's will start turning
And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making...
And brighter than we knew it.
So much to say not just today but always.
We'll have early morning madness.
We'll have magic in the making.
How do you say to your child in the night
How do you say it will all be all right
Children will listen.
But children will listen.
Children will look to you
Children will listen.
Not just on children.
Sometimes the spell may last
Past what you can see
And turn against you...
Careful the tale you tell.
Children will listen...
What do you leave to your child when you're dead
Only what ever you put in it's head
Things that your mother and father had said
Which were left to them too.
Children will glisten.
Tamper with what is true
Children will listen...
I have a love and it's all that I have
I have a love and it's all that I need.
There's nothing to be done.
And all of my life...
And it's all that I need...
Only death will part...
Day after day one life.
Even death won't part...
Day after day one life.
Even death won't part us now.
I've never been in love before.
It's you forever more.
I've never been in love before
I thought I knew the score.
I'm full of foolish song
And out my song must pour.
I'm full of foolish song
And out my song must pour.
They call you lady luck
But there is room for doubt
The pickings have been lush
And yet before this evening is over you might give me the brush
And so the best that I can do is pray...
Luck be a lady tonight.
How good a friend you can be.
Luck be a lady with me.
A lady doesn't wander all over the joint
And blow on some other guy's dice.
When I've bet my life on this roll.
They all say I'm through
Well it's time they knew...
I can break your heart
I can make your sad heart sing
With one look you'll know
All you need to know.
I'm the girl next door
Or the love that you've hungered for
When I speak it's with my soul
The stories my eyes tell
Watch me when I frown
You can't write that down
It's there in black and white
You'll hear what I say.
Sets the screen aflame
Silent music starts to play
Makes the whole world cry.
They'll forgive the past
To my people in the dark
Still out there in the dark...
Silent music starts to play
With one look you'll know
All you need to know.
I'll return to my glory days
This time I'm staying
Where I was born to be
I'll do my best to make him stay.
And in a little while he'll take my hand
Maybe Monday maybe not.
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day...
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love.
Maybe Monday maybe not...
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.
And so all else above I'm waiting for...
We do not belong together.
And we should have belonged together.
What made it so right together
Is what made it all wrong.
But others will do though.
And we'll never belong...
Now it's up to you...
Just keep moving on...
Look at what you want
Not what might have been
Look at all the things you did for me.
I want to find how to get through
Stop wondering which direction is right.
You'd think that you found perfection
And then overnight you keep moving on.
Let me give to you something in return.
Just the best of what was there
And the life moving on.
And we should have belonged together.
Now the moment's gone...
I don't know why I'm frightened
I know my way around here
But I'm not in any hurry
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always
Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
I've spent so many mornings
Just trying to resist you
We were young together.
Not long until the camera's will start turning
And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making...
And brighter than we knew it.
So much to say not just today but always.
We'll have early morning madness.
We'll have magic in the making.
What a wonderful week to be in
Now one day you're hailed for blazing trails
Next you're nailed for fingernails
Now I've kept my clothes and kept me space
I've kept my nose to spite my face
Still once you say you won't
Keep your place loud and clear
Once you announce you're directing all you hear is...
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade.
Who told you you're allowed to rain on my parade
I guess I didn't make it
I guess I didn't make it
And I can't tell you why
There is no reason why I should love that man
I gotta love one man till I die
And when he comes back that day is fine
He can come home as late as can be
Home without him ain't no home to me
I'll know when my love comes along
I'll know then and there...
Suddenly I'll know...
When my love comes along
At the sight of her face...
I knew from the moment I saw you
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children
Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people
People who need people
Will the shy and quiet girl he's going to see
Will he know that there's a world of love
How I'm hoping that his eyes and ears
It's insanity to worry so all day
And then he touched me
I felt a sudden tingle when he touched me
He smiled and seem to tell me so all through it
Control myself and try to act
As if I remember my name
But he touched me... he touched me...
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you
Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
You and I will make each night a first
Every day a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
Two lights that shine as one
Morning glory and midnight sun
Time we've learned to sail above
Time won't change the meaning of one love
The stars have lost their glitter
The winds grow colder
Suddenly you're older
And all because of the man that got away...
The writing's on the wall
The dreams you've dreamed have all gone astray
No more that old time thrill
For you've been through the mill
And never a new love will be the same
But fools will be fools
The road gets rougher
It's lonelier and tougher
With hope you burn up
Tomorrow he may turn up
There's just no let up
But live lone night and day
Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one man woman looking for the man
The man that got away...
Light the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
Can it be that it was all so simple then
If we had the chance to do it all again
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply to choose to forget
You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When you come through the door
At the end of the day
You couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
When it's good for you
And you're feeling alright
Well you just roll over
And turn out the light
And you don't bring me flowers anymore
It used to be so natural
To talk about forever
They just lay on the floor
All the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh
And I learned how to cry
Well I learned how to love
Even learned how to lie
So you'd think I could learn
How to tell you goodbye
It's a lazy afternoon
And the beetle bugs are zooming
And the tulip trees are blooming
It's a lazy afternoon
And the farmer leaves his reaping
And the meadow cows are sleeping
And the speckled trouts stop leaping up stream
A far pink cloud hangs over the hill
Unfolding like a rose
You can hear the grass as it grows
It's a hazy afternoon
And there's no one passing by it to see
Demons are prowling everywhere
No one's gonna hurt you
Others can desert you
Being close and being clever
Ain't like being true
I would never hide a thing from you
No one's gonna hurt you
Others can desert you
Change can come on tiptoe
Love is where it starts
Deep within our hearts
Just by giving and receiving
Each new day leads the way
And we can all be quiet heroes
Walking through the world
Each and every one of us
And the walls can tumble
No lightning bolt or clap or thunder
Endless possibilities
Now hope can spring eternally
Love is all that's necessary
Where is it written what it is I'm meant to be
To have the chance to pick the fruit of every tree
Where are you now that yesterday
The wind is so much colder
The world I see is so much bigger
I remember everything you taught me
Every book I've ever read
Can all the words in all the books
The trees are so much taller
And I feel so much smaller
The moon is twice as lonely
And the stars are half as bright
Kissing me goodnight...
See the way they gaze at her
Like slaves they follow everywhere she goes
Do my eyes forget themselves
And do I ever look at him
And smile in such a way
Sometimes I have the feeling everybody knows
And even though it's crazy
Still I can't help wondering if I'll ever live to see that day
When by some miracle of miracles
He'll turn around and look at me
The more I have to go
We are rid of you at last
You are now a thing of the past
Happy days are here again
The skies above are clear again
So let's sing a song of cheer again
Happy days are here again
Altogether shout it now
So let's tell the world about it now
Happy days are here again
Your cares and troubles are gone
There'll be no more from now on
Happy days are here again
The skies above are here again
All my life is just despair but I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
When I know I'll come back on my knees someday
It cost me a lot but that's one thing that I've got
Cold and wet tired you bet
He's not much for looks
Two or three girls has he
That he likes as well as me but I love him
All my life is just despair but I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
When I know I'll come back on my knees someday
We'll find a new way of living
Will find a way of forgiving
There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
There's a time for us
Someday there'll be a time for us
Time together and time to spare
We'll find a new way of living
Will find there's a way of forgiving
There's a place for us
A time and a place for us
Hold my hand and we're half way there
Just hold my hand and I'll take you there
I believe for every drop of rain that falls
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
I believe for everyone who goes astray
Someone will come to show the way
I believe above the storm the smallest prayer
I believe that someone in the great somewhere
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry
When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
And the sweet silver song of a lark
Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone
Walk me over this horizon
Let the sun's light warm my face
Once again the times are changing
Once again I've lost my way
While the words of ancient poets
Fall like dust upon my shoes
Greed has robbed me of my vision
Turned my heart from higher truths
So take my hand and lift me higher
Be my love and my desire
And take my heart to higher ground
I have walked too long in darkness
I have walked too long alone
Blindly clutching fists of diamonds
That I found were only stones
I would trade the wealth of ages
For a warmer hand to hold
The path of life is narrow
But it leads to streets of gold
So take my hand and lift me higher
Be my love and my desire
Take my heart to higher ground
In this world we move through shadows
Never sure of what we see
While the truth abides between us
Come and share the truth with me
Take my hand and lift me higher
Be my love and my desire
Hold me safe in honor bound
Take my heart to higher ground
Think of all the hearts beating in the world
Think of all the faces and the stories they could tell
Think of all the eyes looking out into this world
Trying to make some sense of what we see
Think of all the ways we have of seeing
Think of all the ways there are of being
Think of all the children being born into this world
Just think of all the hands that will be reaching for a dream
Think of all the dreams that could come true
If the hands we're reaching with could come together joining me and you
When it comes to thinking of tomorrow
We must protect our fragile destiny
In this precious life there's no time to borrow
The time has come to be a family
Just think of all the love pouring from our hearts
Think of all the light our love can shine around this world
Just think what we've been given
And then think what we can lose
All of life is in our trembling hands
It's time to overcome our fears and join to build a world that loves and understands
It helps to think of all the hearts beating in the world
And hope for all the hearts beating in the world
There's a healing music in our hearts beating in this world
So afraid to show I care
Will he think me weak
If I tremble when I speak
There's another one he's thinking of
I don't know what to do
With my heart out in my hand
But what you must understand
You can't let the chance
To love him pass you by
Tell him that the sun and moon
Tender words so soft and sweet
I'll hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself
Your love can't be denied
The truth will set you free
You'll have what's meant to be
All in time you'll see
I don't think I could endure
If I let him walk away
When I have so much to say
Tell him that the sun and moon
Tender words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself
Love is light that surely glows
In the hearts of those who know
It's a steady flame that grows
Feed the fire with all the passion you can show
Tonight love will assume its place
This memory time cannot erase
Blind faith will lead love where it has to say
Tell him that the sun and moon
Whisper words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself
When I walked through the doors I sensed his presence
And I knew this was a place where love abounds
For this is a temple the God we love abides here
And we are standing in his presence
We are standing on holy ground
And I know there are angels all around
For we are standing in his sweet presence
In his presence I know there is joy beyond all measure
And at his feet sweet peace of mind can still be found
For when we have a need he is still the answer
Reach out and claim it for we are standing
We are standing on holy ground
And I know there are angels all around
For we are standing in his sweet presence
The walls between us stand so tall
They don't see there's just one sun
We each choose roads to call our own
That none of us is traveling through
It will be here when we're gone
Someday we'll come to see
Keep spinning on the wheel of time
The mountains we must climb
May color what we see ahead
But all our lives are strung together
It will be here when we're gone
Someday we'll come to see
Around and round and round and round we go
Around and round we go
Laugh and learn and change and grow
Around and round and round we go
It will be here when we're gone
Someday we'll come to see
And neither have I wings to fly
Build me a boat that will carry two
And she sails the sea
But not so deep as the love I'm in
I know not how I sink or swim
My home is over Jordan
I want to cross over into campground
My home is over Jordan
I want to cross over into campground
I want to cross over into campground
And neither have I wings to fly
Build me a boat that will carry two
Behind a door that had no key.
Leading with my heart
Caught me by surprise
There's a part that knows.
Where your heart's desire
Will be waiting for you.
As you believe your eyes.
Where your soul believes
That you're home to stay.
Trusting that it knows.
They say there's a universal plan
I do believe there's a higher power
But in our darkest hour it's hard to understand
We lose faith in what life's all about
Why did the right road take the wrong turn
Just like the seasons there are reasons for the path we take
There are no mistakes
Just lessons to be learned
Let your heartbeat be your guide
You'll find what you've been needing is right before your eyes
You'll hold the answer in your hands
Why did the right road take a wrong turn
Just like the seasons there are reasons for the path we take
There are no mistakes
Just lessons to be learned
No matter how many times you stumble or fall
The greatest lesson is loving yourself through it all
Why did the right road take a wrong turn
There are no mistakes
Everything must change
Nothing stays the same
No one stays the same
The young become the old
And mysteries do unfold
Cause that's the way of time
Nothing and no one goes unchanged
There are not many things in life
Except rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds do fly
Winter turns to spring
A wounded heart will heal
But never much too soon
Everything must change
The young become the old
And mysteries do unfold
Cause that's the way of time
Nothing and no one goes unchanged
There are not many things in life
Except rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
And butterflies do fly
Rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
We have sinned before Thee
Have compassion upon us and upon our children
Cause all hate and oppression to vanish from the earth
Inscribe us for blessing in the Book Of Life
Let the new year be a good year for us
I have searched for you
On the breeze of night
That your arms would hold me tight
Thought love had passed me by
With your tender touch
I felt all fear and sorrow
That nothing in this world
Come happily ever after be
He's blessed us here today
As I've dreamed of you
As I've dreamed of you
Imagine all the lonely years we've wasted.
Me with the neighbors.
Spent with Schopenhauer
Let's forget the past.
Imagine all the years we've wasted.
Losing at backgammon.
Happiest of girls I'm sure to be
If only you would say to me
That it's such a pity
Make believe we've landed
Bathe me in the waters
Warm in the moonlight
Taste me with your kisses
Find my secret places
Touch me till I tremble
Free my wings for flying
And catch me when I'm falling
Keep your arms around me
Like there's no tomorrow
Let me know you love me
Not a soul can see us
Show me how to love you
Teach me how to please you
Lay your dreams beside me
Only stars will listen
To our cries and whispers
You were made to love me
And I was made to love you
Keep your arms around me
Lose yourself inside me
Shining in the distance
Now we're getting closer
Keep your arms around me
Oh now we're almost there
Not a soul can hear us
Fantasies and feelings
Till the morning finds us
You were made to love me
And I was made to love you
Keep your arms around me
Lose yourself completely
Shining there before us
Now we're getting closer
Just keep your arms around me
I look at you and there it is.
The ultimate in where it is
And realize how rare it is
This finding your love.
To find the one and only.
One day you turn and he's there.
Amazing how serene it is.
And knew it would be.
When love like ours arrives
We guard it with our lives.
When a rainy day comes around
A love like ours will keep us safe and sound.
When love like ours arrives
We guard it with our lives.
What rainy day comes around
The one I hold on to.
If you run out of reason to try
I'll love enough for both you and I
I'll be the one you can run to.
I'd rather go through any pain love puts us through
Than to spend one day without you by my side.
In a world of anger and lies
I find peace in your eyes
A flame in the darkness.
You know where my heart is.
I'd rather go through any pain love puts us through
Than to spend one day without you by my side
And I can't remember life without you
The way it used to be
Feels like a million years away.
Tell me every little thing.
Promise me forever from this day
Even more than you know.
Even more than you know.
Even more than you know.
So little joy in their lives.
It might be the way I adore you.
Or the way that you hold me tight.
I don't know the reason
All of our friends say
Love fades away with time.
But I know they're wrong
A love like yours and mine.
So if the whole world goes crazy
Let everyone else fuss and fight.
We'll be the lucky ones.
Oh so little joy in their lives.
If I never saw your face
If I never knew your love
And look at how the world begins to spin
Look at how the shadows disappear
Now that you are here.
If I never felt your kiss
I don't know who I'd love
I don't know what I'd do if I never met you.
Just look at how the shadows disappear
Now that you are here.
If I never felt your kiss
I don't know who I'd love
I don't know what I'd do
I don't know who I'd love
I don't know what I'd do
So little joy in their lives.
It might be the way I adore you.
Or the way that you hold me tight.
I don't know the reason
All of our friends say
Love fades away with time.
But I know they're wrong
A love like yours and mine.
So if the whole world goes crazy
Let everyone else fuss and fight.
We'll be the lucky ones.
Oh so little joy in their lives.
Making me feel things I can't explain.
For some reason I'm just laughing at the rain.
I can't believe who I am has changed to suddenly.
I'm doing things I never thought I'd do.
Nothing else could turn me upside down.
Or plant my feet so firmly on the ground.
Everything I've dreamed is coming true.
Hold me now like this forever
Let this moment go on endlessly.
I'm alive when you're beside me.
That's how I know that we were meant to be.
Everything I say I want to sing.
Everything I've dreamed is coming true.
At last my heart is ready.
This time I can believe
That love has truly found me.
How sweetly love surrounds me.
A blessing I've received.
I'll give you my tomorrows.
But even now I can see...
Won't be enough time for us.
Can't be enough time for us.
What you have given to me
Is better but a dream.
There's no need for pretending
You're my happy ending.
So I will hold you closer
With all the love in me
And wish we had forever
For even now I can see...
Won't be enough time for us.
Can never be enough time.
I prayed my heart would lead me
To find a love somewhere.
It's taken me a lifetime
To find you waiting for me there.
Won't be enough time for us.
And all that's waiting for us
I'd be safe from harm.
I would never find myself
Lost inside your arms.
I'd never feel the pain
Of sunny days without you
Drowning in the rain.
If I didn't love you...
Peace would rule the day
All the dark and out would surely go away.
I wouldn't pay the cost
Of living every endless day
If I didn't love you...
If I didn't love you...
And yet you make me breathless
Could ever love the way we do.
I don't know how you reach me
In that place in my heart
Belonging to only you.
I wouldn't lose control
The danger loving brings a word
Perhaps I wouldn't die.
If you should ever say to me
If I didn't love you...
How can there be music
I can't believe that somehow
I believe in you so much.
Now you've come and taught me
How to give you my heart.
And make me feel at last
That the end will never start.
You're the only reason
I'm not afraid to fall.
For if I didn't love you...
If I didn't love you...
Wait before we take another breath.
We've lived another moment of our lives.
And now it's fast becoming then.
Wait before you take your lips from mine.
How quickly where we are is where we've been.
Once before I knew that I'd be yours
A moment didn't seem a thing at all.
Just like a penny at a fair.
Once I never dreamed there'd come a time
When time would need another day
Forever doesn't mean forever anymore.
And where we are is where we've been.
And every night is like a dream come true
It's then you realize how small forever is.
That's why I treasure all the moments of my life
When the sky and the ground started ringing
I know that he's near
By the thunder I hear in advance
That can start my heart singing
And his is the only music that makes me dance
He'll sleep and he'll rise
In the light of two eyes that adore him
But he won't leave my sight for a glance
But he won't leave my sight for a glance
Even than more than I usually do
I'll be home for Christmas
And presents round the tree
Christmas eve is gonna find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
I'll be home for Christmas
Please have some snow
And lots of mistletoe
Christmas eve is gonna find me
Where the love light gleams
All I want for Christmas is you
Your the gift that's made my dreams all come true
All I need for Christmas is here
Finding every sweet surprise wrapped up in your eyes
Waiting there for me underneath the tree
We'll the spend the day exchanging kisses
Smile and say What a Christmas this is
Long before the snowflakes appear
We will smile and say What a Christmas
Long before the snowflakes appear
Without bells or mistletoe
Maybe it's much too early in the game
Ah but I thought I'd ask you just the same
What are you doing New Year's
I wonder who's arms will hold you good and tight
Maybe I'm crazy to suppose I'd ever be the one you chose
Out of a thousand invitations You'll receive
Ah but it case I stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
What are you doing New Year's
Maybe I'm crazy to suppose you'd choose me
Here comes that jackpot question in advance
What are you doing New Year
I awake on a chilly Christmas morning
Watching choirs singing carols on TV
I gaze out through my window at a dozen other windows
Then I plug in my artificial tree
And like a dream I begin to remember every Christmas I used to know
Coming down like lint
And it made you squint when the wind would blow
And ice like vinyl on the streets
Rain like strings and changing things
Light and noise and bees and boys
I remember days or at least I try
And the bluest ink isn't really sky.
And at times I think I would gladly die
Too alone lost in the storm
And though the wind cries all around us
Still our love keeps us warm
Here with love locked in our arms
And if the world never should find us
In our hearts we won't care
For so deep is our love
And if the world never should find us
In our hearts we don't care
It must have been the mistletoe
The magic in the frosty air
That feeling everywhere
It must have been the pretty lights
That glistened in the silent night
It may be just the stars so bright
That shined above you
More than we'd be dreaming of
The midnight ride upon sleigh
The countryside all dressed in white
That wrapped us up in its spell
It only took one kiss to know
Our first Christmas more than we'd be dreaming of
It must have been the mistletoe
The magic in the frosty air
On Christmas eve our wish came true
That I would fall in love with you
It only took one kiss to know
This is a Christmas Lullaby
To steal softly into dreaming
A simple Christmas lullaby
I sing to you each passing year
The world is wrapped in joy and wonder in silent mystery
And in this spell that we are under
Blessing surround our hearts completely
This is a Christmas Lullaby
For someone lovely as snow falling
I sing your Christmas Lullaby
To cradle you with all our love
Let peace on earth be yours tonight
Under the star that shines so bright
The world is wrapped in joy and wonder
And in this spell that we are under
Blessing surround our hearts completely
Now close your eyes and as you sigh
Make up a Christmas wish to dream on
And like the moon that shines on high
Send out your wish to that star in the sky
They're the sweetest ones I know
Float like snowflakes in the air
I close my eyes and see
Who now have children of their own
I close my eyes and see
Of all the children who now have children
Shiny faces of all the children
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
Can you still help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
Every man would have a friend
That right would always win
And love would never end
What is this illusion called
The innocence of youth
Maybe only in that blind belief
Can we ever find the truth
There'd be no more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And every man would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
As close as the sea is to the seashore
Tide still rises twice a day
That's just the ocean's way of getting
As close as today is to tomorrow
Cause every minute brings them that much closer
So on this silent night
And suddenly all time and space disappears
I see your face in firelight
I hold you close in memory
And even though you're gone
As close as the glow is to the ember
You've always been a part of me
Now living in my heart you're even closer
I see your face in firelight
I hold you close in memory
And even though I know you're gone
As sure as there's snowfall in December
Your love lives in everything
Summer Winter Fall or Spring
Every thought of you will bring us closer
The distance may be large or small
Someday I pray that we may all be
Millions of us lift up our eyes
So many children calling to him
By many a different name
Many the ways all of us pray
Brothers and sisters there are no strangers
After his work is done
For your God and my God
By many a different name
Many the ways all of us pray
Many the paths winding their way
Brothers and sisters there were no strangers
After the world was done
I have dreams for you and me
And wishes that will last
And live beyond eternity
Can we weather everything
I promise you that I...
I will be the one to run to
When the nights are long
I'll be there when winds begin to blow
That everything is going wrong
I won't be the one to let go
Who knows what awaits us round the bend
Though everything we have could never end
And through rain or shine
I will be the one to run to
When the nights are long
I'll be there when winds begin to blow
That everything is going wrong
I won't be the one to let go
Twenty thousand you need me
You'll know where I am
You'll know just where I am
Twenty thousand you're lost
And take my hand and...
I will be your light in the night
That even when it seems
That everything is going wrong
I won't be the one to let go
Out on the street anybody you meet got a heartache of their own
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we never let it end
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't want to hear your goodbye
Little by little we meet in the middle
There's danger in the dark
Make it a crime to out in the cold
You battle on with the love you're building on
It's got be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we never let it end
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't want to hear your goodbye
Don't want to hear your goodbye
I don't want to hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Don't want to hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of
You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When I come through the door at the end of the day...
I remember when you couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after loving me late at night
And you're feeling all right
When you just roll over and turn out the light...
And you don't bring me flowers anymore
It used to be so natural
To talk about forever
They just lay on the floor
Till we sweep them away
And baby I remember all the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh and I learned how to cry
So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye
So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye
You don't bring me flowers any more...
You don't sing me love songs
This time it's different
It's all because of you
It's better than it's ever been
It's all you had to say to take my breath away
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one
To be with every night
My life has just begun
I would wait forever just to know you were mine
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one
To be with every night
My life has just begun
My life has just begun
You're gonna leave me
I can see that faraway look in your eyes
The heart grow fonder
And that tears are on their way
You're gonna leave me
I can see that faraway look in your eyes
That it won't be long
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion
For a cozy cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
I've got a crush on you
I've got a crush on you
I never had the least notion
that I could fall with...
for a lovely cottage...
The world will pardon my mush
So afraid to show I care
Will he think me weak
If I tremble when I speak
There's another one he's thinking of
I don't know what to do
With my heart out in my hand
But what you must understand
You can't let the chance
To love him pass you by
Tell him that the sun and moon
Tender words so soft and sweet
I'll hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself
Your love can't be denied
The truth will set you free
You'll have what's meant to be
All in time you'll see
I don't think I could endure
If I let him walk away
When I have so much to say
Tell him that the sun and moon
Tender words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself
Love is light that surely glows
In the hearts of those who know
It's a steady flame that grows
Feed the fire with all the passion you can show
Tonight love will assume its place
This memory time cannot erase
Blind faith will lead love where it has to say
Tell him that the sun and moon
Whisper words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself
There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break
We let the heartache in
There was a world when we were standing still
And for a moment we were separated...
And then you found her
You let the stranger in
Forever more that's what we are to be
We'll be remembering when...
There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break
We let the heartache in
When someone is in your eyes...
I have a love and it's all that I have
I have a love and it's all that I need.
There's nothing to be done.
And all of my life...
I have a love and it's all that I need...
Only death will part...
Day after day one life.
Even death won't part...
Day after day one life.
Even death won't part us now.
One less bell to answer
One less man to pick up after
I only know that since he left
Thought I try to forget
It just can't be done
Each time the doorbell rings
I don't know how in the world
To stop thinking of him
I end each day the way I start out
I start and end each day crying
One less bell to answer
One less man to pick up after
A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sitting there
But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
When there's no one there
You can kiss goodnight
A room is still a room
Even when there's nothing there but gloom
But a room is not a house
And a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart
Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
Don't let one mistake keep us apart
I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stair and turn the key
Still in love with me
One less bell to answer
I'm lucky I've got one less man
And love is in the wind
Like some music in a dream
You made them all come true
When you came inside of my life
And lost in your eyes
I could spend all of my time
Hearing songs you sing
Feeling love you bring
Darling being close to you
Made all my dreams come true
When you came inside my life
And sometimes I would wonder
Could the one to save me
I held you close to my heart
But I never thought that I'd feel the way I do
Until that certain moment when I loved you
And now I can't ever imagine
My living without you
It seems I spend all of my time
Thinking only about you
Once I dreamed in a dream I would find you
Never thought that the dream would come true
Until that certain moment when I loved you
Until that certain moment
Certain moment when I loved you
Don't call him up anymore
He only knows how I feel
I only know what he's like
Don't get to close when you dance
You were out on the town
I don't wanna know where he goes
Don't call him up anymore
The one I hold on to.
If you run out of reason to try
I'll love enough for both you and I
I'll be the one you can run to.
I'd rather go through any pain love puts us through
Than to spend one day without you by my side.
In a world of anger and lies
I find peace in your eyes
A flame in the darkness.
You know where my heart is.
I'd rather go through any pain love puts us through
Than to spend one day without you by my side
And I can't remember life without you
The way it used to be
Feels like a million years away.
Tell me every little thing.
Promise me forever from this day
Even more than you know.
Even more than you know.
Even more than you know.
Heightens each sensation...
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination.
Silently the senses abandon their defenses
Helpless to resist the notes I write
Night unfurls its splendor.
There you trust the music of the night...
And the truth isn't what you want to see.
In the dark it is easy to pretend
That the truth is what it ought to be...
Music shall caress you.
Secretly posses you...
The darkness of the music of the night...
Close your eyes start a journey through a strange new world
Only then can you belong to me...
Let your darker side give in
Help me make the music of the night...
Once there was a wicked witch
In the lovely land of OZ
With terror and with dread
Till one fine day from Kansas
A house fell on her head
And through the town the joyous news went running
The joyous news that the wicked old witch
Wake up you sleepy head
She's gone where the goblins go
Let's open up and sing
And ring those bells out...
Sing it high and sing it low
Let them know the wicked old witch is dead
You better chase all your cares away
The skies above are clear again
Happy days are here again.
Shout it now there's no one
The lord is wait to take you're hand
So let's tell the world
We're going to the promise land
Happy days are here again.
We're heading cross the river
Sun you case when I'll be gone
There'll be no more from now on
You better chase all your cares away
The skies above are clear again
Once I found a perfect love
And you showed me everything there was to know of love
Time will not betray the truth
And for all the years we've shared I celebrate with you
You are all I know of love
How could I ask for more
You're everything I'm dreaming of
You're all I need from love
I swear I'll always feel the same
All I want from love...
You are my only heart
I loved you from the start
You are all I know of love
How could I ask for more
You're everything I'm dreaming of
You're all I need from love
I swear I'll always feel the same
You're all I want from love
My love flows free through you
You'll always be the one who taught me everything
My heart knows to be sure
You're all I know of love
How could I ask for more
You're everything I'm dreaming of
You're all I need from love
I swear I'll always feel the same
You're all I want from love
And maybe tomorrow you'll see the sun come shining through for you.
Light up your face with gladness.
That's the time you must keep trying.
That's the time you must keep on trying.
I'm crossing you in style someday
Where ever you're going I'm going your way
Two drifters of to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waiting round the bend
My huckleberry friend
I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
I'm in the mood for love
Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
I'm in the mood for love
Why stop to think of whether
Let's put our hearts together
If there's a cloud above
But for tonight forget it
I'm in the mood for love
Why stop to think of whether
Let's put our hearts together
If there's a cloud above
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
I hear the sound of violins
And with your kiss the world begins
Like a leaf clings to a tree
For we're creatures of the wind
For we're creatures of the wind
Has the murmuring sound of May
And the laughter of children at play
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
I've known the smiles that melt your heart away
Those past imperfect words that lovers say
I've danced through the dawn
Kissed and closed my eyes
Never seemed exactly right
Just another love affair
Then I turned and you were there
You smiled and the world never was the same
I was in love before I even knew your name
All my life has led to you
And though the child in me was dazzled by your charms
A women was awakened in your arms
Who dreamed I could feel all the things I do
It seems all too wonderful... impossible and yet it's true
I feel I'm falling more in love with you
How do you lose yourself to someone
And since you know we're always changing
And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart
I know the way I feel for you it's now or never
If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day to make it better as it grows
With any luck then I suppose
If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day to make it better as it grows
With any luck then I suppose
Beautiful to take a chance
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
And I'm thinking if you were mine
A desert road from Vegas to nowhere
Some place better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixing
In a little café just around the bend
A hot dry wind blows right through me
The baby's crying and can't sleep
But we both know a change in coming
Coming close sweet release
The second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable
The second time you fall
There are those who'd bet
Love comes but once and yet
I'm oh so glad we met
The second time around
There are those who'd bet
Love comes but once and yet
I'm oh so glad we met
The second time around
Goodbye until whenever then
Goodbye until whenever then
Everyone tells me to know my place
But that ain't the way I play
Well I've got something to say
I've got me some wings I'm eager to try
Are you ready for the day
That we've prayed for
Already holding what is real
You know the soul finds its own evolution
And this is the only love I feel
I'm keeping up the strength
I'm out here waiting for you
With all I've got to give
And I accept this life we live
And I'll be your friend
I wasn't made to tell you lies
I only came to make you realize
And I'll be your clown
I got to turn away my face
You know I love you in the black of night
This journey has begun
We try... We try to carry on
You get to find the things in life
And deep inside the things you are
Let me make it happen
And I will tell you how I feel
Love will be better for wearing your ring
I'm gonna give you everything
I wasn't made to tell you lies
I only came to make you realize
And I'll be your clown
And if you suffer for the millions
Then it's what your fighting for
Someone believes in only light of day
Someone strong enough to show the way
Someone everyone believes in
And that will be your heart in mine
My love is on the line
For a Stranger in a strange land far away
And just to see your spirit shine
I feel your hand in mine
I write a letter every single day
To a stranger in a strange land far away
May we share the most tomorrows
I will hear you when you cry
Should we let it come between us
Never knowing how we live or die
I will walk you through the pouring rain
I will help you learn to live and love again
I send you home again
And that will be your heart in mine
My love is on the line
To a stranger in a strange land far away
And somewhere in the lonely night
Your flame is burning bright
For a stranger in a strange land far away
And just to see your spirit shine
I feel your hand in mine
I write a letter every single day
To a stranger in a strange land far away
I saw you looking in the mirror
I saw you fighting with your conscious
I think you need a little time away and I may give you mine
And you can fine me in the moon glow
You find me underneath your pillow
And we can find a little hideaway where we can go
I'm in the corner with a friend of mine
So many things that bring you close to me
That we be led astray
To love the things we cannot touch
Maybe we turn and say goodnight and walk away
And then the story can go on without a single tear
You take a chance on it and change the history
And for a time we fall in love with someone
So who am I to say the words that say we've found each other
Can we imagine any hideaway is right
And our adventure down in paradise
And we are one with the night
Maybe we shuffle of to Rio
And then I get a little chance to say
And you and I can change the world if we just try
This lonely heart of mine has found a mission for your light
To make the sense of it
And solve the mystery
Its just a love you forever leave with someone
So who am I to say the words that say we've found each other
Can we imagine any hideaway is right
And our adventure down in paradise
And we are one with the night
And our adventure down in paradise
You can say what you got to say
I'm ready to go anywhere you choose
You decide if I live or die
I'm ready to accept your point of view
And there's something about that way you smile
Every touch leaves me helpless
Every moment drives me wild
I never saw the cause that made you lie
And never said goodbye inside
You can go where you got to go
Wherever you lead baby
I'm ready to be all you want me to
And I walk in the dark and the candle burns
Out of place your face is missing
Come the day that you'll return
This moment stops in time
The reason and the rhyme
You can go where you got to go
I'm ready to be all you want me to
I fight to the end for the night of my life
And nothing can get in my way
And love is a river and river is ocean take up your pleasure and all that you cry for
I go to the wall for the night of my life
I play every game that you play
I shout out my struggles and send out a message to you
I fight to the end for the night of my life and nothing can get in my way
I shout out my struggles and send out a message to you
I fight to the end for the night of my life and nothing can stand in my way
I go to the wall for the night of my life
I play every game that you play
I shout out my struggles and send out a message to you
Tell me what I do for you.
This is me talking to you
You'll never be alone with me
I close or open the door
Telling you that less is more
You cannot disguise whatever you do
No one is above the law
In these dark and troubled times
People just surviving
We live a double life
You'd be safe and warm at home
Something else is going on
We don't have to kiss and say no more about it
And if your eyes are watching me
And we become invisible
The pleasure is the punishment
Break away the chains that bind
It's not enough to be satisfied
It's knowing how it all begins
Or knowing where the heart belongs
And we all make mistakes
It's your heart and my heart
And no one can take part
Is love above the law
So you decide we go insane
I know what you came here for
We'll ever be above the law
On this dark and stormy night
Where these walls may hide us
You sigh and let me in
You let me hold you in these arms of mine
And we may get to kiss and say no more about it
And if my eyes are watching you
It's your heart and my heart
And no one can take part
I'll always be with you
It's what I'm living for
The end of my rainbow
Is outside your window
And our love is one love
It's your heart and my heart
And no one can take part
I'll always be with you
The end of my rainbow
Is outside your window
And our love is one love
This is me talking to you
I look around and I can't speak.
Pretending to be living there.
And maybe there was something between us.
I cannot see beyond your face.
What I am searching for is someone's shadow.
Am I unwise to let the story end.
I would not hurt you.
Your dark became my night.
I would not walk one step without you ever.
I would not be alive today.
You should understand.
Your shooting from the heart when your dreaming.
For one moment there is someone loving me.
And no one else can change that place and time.
You go through the motion.
But all your emotion is gone.
And if I make this promise I deliver.
Beneath it all I know.
That looking back I lived on your laughter.
And there were diamonds in the dust.
And there were moments we could never follow.
And in the morning rain.
I always told you at the closing of the day.
I will not leave you.
Your dark becomes my light.
I will not take one step without you ever.
I would not be alive today.
Without your love... Without your love.
They try to tell us who we are
And we remember in the future not to cry
You could be an angel
Look in your ancient eyes
Knowing what the power of your future could be
To fall and then to rise
It's knowing how it was and how that sets you free
All the children will send out
All the children will dance and
Through the rhythm of ages
All the children will dance and
They won't be hiding any secrets from
Things can never be but what they
You could be an angel
Make all your dreams come true
All the children will send out
All the children will dance and
Through the rhythm of ages
All the children will dance and
Freedom is for everyone to know
Tell them what your truth is when you play
Freedom is the message in your song
In the light of what is swept away
There's someone there to catch you
All the children will send out
All the children will dance and
With nothing left to say
We left the dream begin
It was carried on the wind
And the song of the storm
All alone making love
Gone is the world outside
Home on the turning tide
True love will find the sun
And know the reason why
You make me hunger for
Over the ocean's roar
And the night will become
With you I have it all
If love can never die
I'm not afraid to fly
But how far must I fall
For all the love we make
It's the look in your eyes
It's the sound of the heart
Gone is the dark of night
Call on the early glow
Send down the birds of love
And still I will hunger for
Over the ocean's roar
And your arms reach for me
And the shine on the sea
And the night will become
Maybe I don't wanna know the reason why
But lately you don't talk to me
I hold you near but you're so far away
And it's losing you I can't believe
To watch you leave and let this feeling die
You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
If I'm here without your love
You know I can't survive
Only my love can raise you high above it all
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
We can take the darkness
And make if full of light
But let your love flow back to me
How can you leave and let this feeling die
Would be a lonely place when you are gone
And I won't even have your shoulders for the crying on
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
We changed the world we made it ours to hold
But dreams are made for those who really try
This losing you is real
But I still feel you here inside
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
A child that hides behind a chair
Almost afraid to grow
Whisper words that make you see
What you've come to mean to me
A voice that rises from the heart
And tears my soul apart
And serving only to renew
How I came to feel for you
Through your love I'd see forever
I never saw you turn away
You call me when your storm is over
Crying over love that I can give you
When the night is colder
And it's so hard not to cry
With your face that lies
You memorize the reason why
And when the love is gone
Then one of us will know
It's so hard letting go
Foolish that I still believe
That love should never die
It makes me cry to witness where the story ends
All the lovers in the world
Will echo all the words
That I will leave you
When the night is lonely
That it's so hard letting go
And it's so hard not to cry
And I kneel and pray for yesterday
And when the love is gone
Then one of us will know
No complaints and no regrets
I still believe in chasing dreams and placing bets
For I have learned that all you give is all you get
So give it all you've got
And even though I'm satisfied
To see what's down another road
And all the joy it brings
And dreamers and their dreams
How love can turn from warm hellos to sad goodbyes
And leave you with the memories you memorize
To keep your winters warm
But there's no yes in yesterday
And who knows what tomorrow brings or takes away
As long as I'm still in the game
So here's to life and all the joy it brings
And dreamers and their dreams
May all your storms be weathered
And all that's good get better
May all your storms be weathered
And all that's good get better
You can always find something to do
But from dusk till dawn
As the clock ticks on
Something happens to you
In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake thinking of the guy
Never even think of counting sheep
When lonely heart has learned it's lesson
You'd be his if only he would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
It's the time you miss him most of all
When lonely heart has learned it's lesson
You'd be his if only he would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
And alone in the world
Will be your love for a while
I feel your tears as they fall
They are warm like gentle rain
Come little one you have me in the
World and our love will be sweet
Very sweet like gentle rain
Then you might as well
All the birds that flew
When our love was new
And our hearts were high
When the day was young
And the nights were long
When the moon stood still
For the night bird's song
We'll sail on the sun
We'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees
Leave me just enough love
I'll make you a night
Like no night has been
I'll sail on your smile
I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes
Leave me just enough love
There be nothing left
In this world to trust
Though I would have been the shadow
If you might have kept me
There's no mistaking robins
Building nests from coast to coast
My heart tries to sing
So they won't hear it breaking
Spring can really hang you up the most
College boys are writing sonnets
While I'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnets
Spring can really hang you up the most
Doctors once prescribed a tonic
My condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most
Old man winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying for snow to hide the clover
Make just one someone happy.
Make just one heart the heart you sing to.
One face that lights when it nears you.
One gal you're everything to.
Comes and goes in a minute.
Someone to love is the answer.
Build your world around her.
Make just one someone happy
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart
One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A time for summer skies
For hummingbirds and butterflies
For tender words that harmonize with love
A time for climbing hills
For leaning out of windowsills
Admiring daffodils above
A time for holding hands together
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of
As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above
I know a time for spring
A time for holding hands together
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of
As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above
I know a time for spring
Maybe I should have saved
Those leftover dreams
But here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day
And I laughed at the thought
That it might turn out this way
Where is that worn out wish
After it brought my love so near
Funny how love becomes
That rainy day is here
Where is that worn out wish
After it brought my love so near
Funny how love becomes
From too much talk to silent touches
We turned our hearts to love then tried it
And morning finds us caught in life's most
Old souls find new life
In hearts that are listening like ours
And old dreams find young wings
From too much talk to loving touches
When pure emotion takes the moment
They asked me how I knew my true love was true
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed to think they could doubt my love
Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide
Haven't done half the things we want to
This day was just a token
Too many words are still unspoken
But let's just be glad for what we've had
When lonely feelings chill
Is merely that it knows
Just as a tree is sure
It knows its emptiness
Is just the time of year
The frozen mountain dreams
You must believe in love
Just as the sleeping rose
Awaits the kiss of May
You must believe in Spring and love
You must believe in love
Just as the sleeping rose
Awaits the kiss of May
You must believe in Spring and love
You must believe in Spring and love
Being good isn't good enough
Being good won't be good enough
And I'll need special wings so far to go
Gotta fly and if I fall
That's the way it's gotta be
There's no other way for me
Being good just won't be good enough
I'll be the best or nothing at all
Gotta fly and if I fall
That's the way it's gotta be
There's no other way for me
Being good just won't be good enough
People are too smart...
Made some sense of it
This time I had the answer
Right here in my hand
And it had turned to sand
Sang our song in tune
Made that long hard climb
Bend your branches green
Listen willow and weep for me
Gone and left me here to weep my tears into the stream
Hear me willow and weep for me
And say that love has sinned
To hide her starry light
So none will find me sighing here and crying all alone
Bend your branches down along the ground
When the shadows fall
The partings easier when there are smiles instead of tears.
In your dreams you see that moment even if you live a million years.
You'll only feel a little better.
Try to keep your body busy and let your mind forget him.
Leave behind a friend.
And I think it's gonna rain today.
The frozen smiles to chase love away.
And I think it's gonna rain today.
I think I'll kick it down the street.
That's the way to treat a friend.
Help the needy and show them the way.
And I think it's gonna rain today.
I think I'll kick it down the street.
That's the way to treat a friend.
Help the needy and show them the way.
With one more look at you
I could learn to tame the clouds
And let the sun shine through
Leave a troubled past and I might start anew
I'll solve the mysteries if you're the prize
Refresh these tired eyes
With one more look at you
I might overcome the anger
That I learned to know
Find a piece of mind I lost so long ago
Your gentle touch has made me strong again
For when you look at me
I'm everything and more that I had dreamed I'd be
My spirit feels a promise
We'll love and live more
Love and live forever
With one more look at you
I'd learn to change the stars
And change our fortunes too
I'd have the constellations paint your portrait too
So all the world might share this wonderful sight
The world could end each night
With one more look at you
With one more look at you
I want one more look at you
Your eyes are like fingers
I'm riding the passion arising inside me
I see the hunger arise in your eyes
And it's urging me on
Higher and harder and it's faster and farther
Your pleasure is part of the secret
Of flight that I found
When I feel like an eagle
My soul has no place on the ground
If you don't look away I'm secure
In the fact that you won't let me fall
Who'll help you escape
From the lies you've been told
When they're breaking your back
Bring the last straw to me
I break chains made of boredom that others have lived with for years
I leave good news on doorsteps
And laughs where there used to be tears
I'm gonna need you later
When you're not around
I'm all alone in a place I have never been.
I see a door to a garden and wander in.
And though my journey has barely begun
I am spun like a top to the top of the universe and
High in a spiral of ice I gaze upon a scene
That flickers far below me.
And what I see is a crinkle of colors and sounds.
I can hear tinkles of crystal
And I can see sparkles of mist on the spangles
And I can feel tangles of tingles and sprinklings of angles
And inklings of angels around.
A rabbit crosses my path unexpectedly.
I hear a sigh of despair as he passes me.
I have a feeling that rabbit is late
For wherever he's going whatever he's headed for is my destination
Because here's where the right things happen
Oh baby here's where the good things are
Looking at this enormous butterfly
Wondering if he cares to dance with me
Idly I ponder how far have I yet to find it
I've got to find it and act as though I've lost it
Otherwise I'm lost in wonderland
I've got to find it or else I am bound
To the empty ground bleak and vast.
Where dark spells are cast.
Flooring above me and ceiling below me
And chandeliers rising like tremulous towers
And tables and chairs and beds hanging like blossoms
In turquoise and purple and green.
I took a walk through your mind and I lingered there.
But what I found I can never reveal to you
Not with my words nor the pitch of my flute recall it.
You'll simply have to come walking with me
Beyond the gossamer doors of sleep.
And does he walk away
So I ask each weeping willow
And each brook along the way
And each lad that comes a whistling
Through the heather on the hill
There's lazy music in the air
And all I want to do is wander
Through the heather on the hill
There may be other days as rich and rare
There may be other springs as full and fare
But they won't be the same
Look at teddy bear yawning too
All those animals sleeping in your bed
Such a sleepy smile you must surely know
All the lovely things you'll be dreaming of
Eating jelly beans to your heart's delight
In a fairy tale in a wonderland through the night...
I hope that she forgets and leaves my door open
So I can have a little light from the hallway
But it looks different than it looks in the daytime
A dinosaur or dragon maybe
I close my eyes and there are ghosts and witches
I'm scared a wicked witch will eat me
It was our best performance
All in our thought last night
We knew all of our lines
And we knew how to say them
Just how to play them
Keeping it light till the tears fell
Though we both knew our story was ending
We were surprised when it came
Some things are just too good to be true
And no one's to blame
So there was no applause
When we brought down the curtain
There wasn't anything left to say
Maybe somehow our hearts knew
What our eyes couldn't see
If it's meant to be...
So there was no applause
Though there were tears and laughter
Then moments after we left the stage
And we closed the play
Maybe somehow our hearts knew
What our eyes couldn't see
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I was back there
Wind that makes the tall grass bend into leaning
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Maybe there's a chance for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Suddenly my world's gone and changed its face
But I still know where I'm going
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growing
If we should believe the things that we see
Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy
But it's taught me to love
And I've learned that we must look inside our hearts to find
A world full of love like yours and mine
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion
For a cozy cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
I've got a crush on you
I've got a crush on you
I never had the least notion
that I could fall with...
for a lovely cottage...
The world will pardon my mush
This time it's different
It's all because of you
It's better than it's ever been
It's all you had to say to take my breath away
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one
To be with every night
My life has just begun
I would wait forever just to know you were mine
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one
To be with every night
My life has just begun
My life has just begun
I have dreams for you and me
And wishes that will last
And live beyond eternity
Can we weather everything
I promise you that I...
I will be the one to run to
When the nights are long
I'll be there when winds begin to blow
That everything is going wrong
I won't be the one to let go
Who knows what awaits us round the bend
Though everything we have could never end
And through rain or shine
I will be the one to run to
When the nights are long
I'll be there when winds begin to blow
That everything is going wrong
I won't be the one to let go
Twenty thousand you need me
You'll know where I am
You'll know just where I am
Twenty thousand you're lost
And take my hand and...
I will be your light in the night
That even when it seems
That everything is going wrong
I won't be the one to let go
Out on the street anybody you meet got a heartache of their own
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we never let it end
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't want to hear your goodbye
Little by little we meet in the middle
There's danger in the dark
Make it a crime to out in the cold
You battle on with the love you're building on
It's got be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we never let it end
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't want to hear your goodbye
Don't want to hear your goodbye
I don't want to hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Don't want to hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of
But I couldn't find anybody to care.
Where could I ever find words to say
Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near
Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by
On the day that you were born
The angels got together and
Decided to create a dream come true
And golden starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Ladies and Gents Neil Diamond
I think she's nice and
She has such voice and
She got such elegance
Well if I really am your guest
I have a small request
Anything you wanna do
Can you tell the moment
Spring becomes the summer
Even while we're watching
Blades of grass are growing
Leaps and bounds so tiny
That our eyes cannot see
Perhaps there's a time
When it somehow knows it
Can you tell the moment
If there's such a moment
What you were not before
Is there any sign or warning
Or do you awake one morning
Knowing that you must have turned
Maybe in an April shower
Something tells a bud to flower
What is it that tells you
And a good man is hard to find
You always get the other kind
Just when you think that he is your pal
You look for him and find him
You even pray to see him
So if your man is nice
And hug him in the morning
As you play the game of love
You put your heart on the spin of the dice
And when the dealer turns up the Jack of spades
Let the chips fall where they may
But a woman's gotta keep in mind
Even if she's the queen of hearts
And though the next good man is mighty hard to find
You're gonna feel so lonely
That you had your way
You know it will grieve me
You're never gonna find no other girl
Who can treat you so right
And forward to the East
My house is made of flowers
The warm winds carpet the floor
Whenever there's spring showers
I open the rainbow door
All make my home their home
My curtains are crape mottle
And the firefly flies neath my dome
And I'll never need none
And my clock is the sun
If it all sounds tempting
I show to the heavens
That it do make it nice
Won't you come live with me
Life isn't always what it seems
You have to fight to hold your dreams
I'll not let mine slip out the window
I've got no time to see which way the wind blows
One day I'll wash my grubby face
Then shine it right on in the race to somewhere
Come big or small chance I'll take it there
I'll join the dance and sing my way
I'll knock the whole world down on its ear
Think of all the boys
Think of all the girls
That life is passing by
I'm always chasing rainbows
Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Some fellas look and find the sunshine
I always look and find the rain
Some fellas make a winning sometime
I never even make a game
I'm always chasing rainbows
And waiting to find a little bluebird
I'm always chasing rainbows
And waiting to find a little bluebird
Maybe dream's a dream
Just how real the dawn
I'm safe beneath its light
The secrets of the night
Like the sweet forbidden feelings deep inside me
Each night it hears me cry
Each night it hears us cry
And the beat is strong
All the people turn to hear
And catch the cry of pain
But in his haunted face
And in his searching eyes
But the sounds are slurred by the singer
Till the people feel every aching part
Of the broke heart of the singer
Still the song goes on
That seemed so sure and true
And from the tears he shows
He hits the final note
It catches in his throat
And as he bows and goes
Now you say you're lonely
You cried the lone night through
I cried a river over you
Now you say you're sorry
I cried a river over you
Nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me
Now you say you love me
I cried a river over you
Nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me...
And now you say you love me
I cried a river over you
Just reach for your had
You'll live to love another day.
The tears that you're crying
That's the time you miss him most of all...
You've just gotta say...
White lace and promises
A kiss for luck and we're on our way.
So many roads to choose
We start our walking and learn to run.
Working together day to day
So much of life ahead
This time it's different
It's all because of you
It's better than it's ever been
It's all you had to say to take my breath away
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one
To be with every night
My life has just begun
I would wait forever just to know you were mine
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one
To be with every night
My life has just begun
My life has just begun
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
And steal a kiss or two
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away I'll find my love some day
When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
At the end of the storm
And the sweet silver song of a lark
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
Hold your head up high
And the sweet silver song of a lark
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone
I wanted the music to play on forever
I wanted the clown to be constantly clever
Allow me blue ribbons to tie up my hair
But I couldn't find anybody to care
There is nothing to win
Look at that fabulous face of yours
I knew first look I took at it
This was the face that the world adores
As wise and as deep as the sea
It shows what a nose should be
Friendly and warm as a summer day
Your face is just a miracle
The way that it makes me happy
Whatever the time or place
I will find in no book
It's so nice to have you here
Life was awfully flat
Dolly will never go away...
Put on you Sunday clothes
When you feel dawn and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about
That Sunday shine is a certain sign
Take the someone whose arms you're in
Hold onto her tight and spin
But my arms felt sure and strong
It only takes a moment
To be loved a whole life long...
To bring you the sweet things
One of your old favorite songs
When you're down and out
Lift up your head and shout
There's gonna be a great day
Promise that by and by
There's gonna be a great day
Gabriel will warn you
You will hear his horn
Lift up your head and say
There's gonna be a great day
When you're down and out
Lift up your head and shout
There's gonna be a great day
Promise that by and by
We're gonna see a great day
Gabriel will warn you
Lift up your head and say
There's gonna be a great day
One of those great days
If you believe he will receive you and me
Gabriel will warn you
Lift up your head and say
There's gonna be a great
We're gonna see a great
Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near
Just like me they long to be
Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by
On the day that you were born
The angels got together and
Decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
And golden starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me they long to be
Just like me they long to be
When the skies are bright canary yellow
I forget every cloud I've ever seen
So they call me a cockeyed optimist
Immature and incurably green
I have heard people rant and rave and bellow
That we're done and we might as well be dead
But I'm only a cockeyed optimist
And I can't get it into my head
I hear the human race is falling on its face
And hasn't very far to go
But every whippoorwill is selling me a bill
And telling me it just ain't so
Now I could say life is just a bowl of Jello
And appear more intelligent and smart
But I'm stuck like a dope with a thing called hope
And a good man is hard to find
You always get the other kind
Just when you think that he is your pal
You look for him and find him
You even pray to see him laying in his grave
You put your heart on the spin of the dice
And when the dealer turns up the Jack of Spades
And though the next good man is mighty hard to find
I feel so lonely for you only
You'll miss your red hot mama some of these days
You're never gonna find no other girl who can treat you so right
Doing what I did again
Once more through the door
There are things I must find
And when I sit in my father's chair
My feet can reach the floor
My mother doesn't spank me just
For going without a hat
She knows darn well I'd run away
I'm even more than 4 and a half
This is me talking to you
You'll never be alone with me
I close or open the door
Telling you that less is more
You cannot disguise whatever you do
No one is above the law
In these dark and troubled times
People just surviving
We live a double life
You'd be safe and warm at home
Something else is going on
We don't have to kiss and say no more about it
And if your eyes are watching me
And we become invisible
The pleasure is the punishment
Break away the chains that bind
Or knowing where the heart belongs
And we all make mistakes
It's your heart and my heart
And no one can take part
Is love above the law
So you decide we go insane
I know what you came here for
We'll ever be above the law
On this dark and stormy night
Where these walls may hide us
The walls may hide us
You sigh and let me in
You let me hold you in these arms of mine
And we may get to kiss and say no more about it
And if my eyes are watching you
It's your heart and my heart
And no one can take part
I'll always be with you
It's what I'm living for
The end of my rainbow
Is outside your window
And our love is one love
It's your heart and my heart
And no one can take part
I'll always be with you
The end of my rainbow
Is outside your window
Parallel lines that touched one another.
Drawn to each other...
So much of you for me to discover.
I've waited all of my life to find
Someone who'd need my heart and read my mind.
To light my days and warm my nights.
My someone for all my life.
Loving the look of love that I see there.
I find when I look deep in your eyes
Reflections of me there.
I've waited all of my life to find
Someone who'd need my heart and read my mind.
To light my days and warm my nights.
Now all at once in your arms.
We're alone in the world
From the storm out there
You'll be the only love
That I've known in the world
And there is too much pain
And far too little love
To few others who care
Is all that we own in the world
And love's the refuge
Let me face the day with you
And love's the refuge
It was quite a fight it was quite a fight
If you don't want to get nervous
Do yourself a great big service
Stay away please far from seventh avenue
You can lose your sense and reason
Guessing what style for next season
It's a battle of fierce and grim
Will she say with a tossing head
And that rare guy wouldn't drop dead
A sheer impossibility
And try to build that industry
Can human beings be...
Hear the cheer to push the music hits us everyone
Day after day... they go on this way
To the cockeyed way the job that must be done
Off to the fray on the brave crusade
Though in health got speed
What a business what a sack game
Yet it's about as much your business is a crap game
So the last line you got pie with
Coming right up is another you could die with
If you're right the dough could flow in
If you're not you haven't got a pot to sew with
Off to the fray on the brave crusade
Though in health got speed
Off to the fray on the brave crusade
Though in health got speed
When the sun is warm where you are
And its comfortable and safe where you are
And somewhere in the world
And while you're feeling young
And while your stomachs full
Somewhere in this world
When there is so much
When there's laughter all around me
And my family and friends surround me
That somewhere in the world
And while you speak your mind
And while your children sleep
Somewhere in this world
When there is so much
Before the parade passes by
Before the parade passes by
Before the parade passes by
I've gotta get in step while there's still time left
I'm ready to move out in front
Life without life has no reason or rhyme left
With the rest of them
With the best of them
I wanna hold my head up high
I wanna feel my heart coming alive again
Before the parade passes by...
Before the parade passes by
I've gotta go and taste Saturday's high life
Before the parade passes by
I've gotta get some life back into my life
I'm ready to move out in front
I've had enough of just passing by life
With the rest of them
With the best of them
I can hold my head up high
For I've got a goal again
I've got a drive again
I wanna feel my heart coming alive again
Before the parade passes by
When the parade passes by
Listen and hear that brass harmony growing
When the parade passes by
Pardon me if my old spirit is showing
All of those lights over there
Seem to be telling me where I'm going
When the whistles blow
And the cymbals crash
And the sparklers light the sky
I'm gonna raise the roof
Give me an old trombone
They used to tell me I was building a dream
And so I followed the mob
When there was earth to plow or guns to bear
They used to tell me I was building a dream
With peace and glory ahead
Why should I be standing in line
Made it race against time
Once I built a tower up to the sun
Brick and rivet and lime
Half a million boots went slogging through Hell
And I was the kid with the drum
Half a million boots went slogging through Hell
And I was the kid with the drum
Lovers say that in France
When they thrill to romance
It means that it's so good
Like the French people do
Because it's oh so good
Leads to only one thought
Nothing else can replace
And if you only would be my own for the rest my days
I will whisper this phrase
And I can't tell you why
I gotta love one man till I die.
You've got to be taught to hate and fear
You've got to be taught from year to year
It's got to be drummed in your dear little ear
You've got to be carefully taught
You've got to be taught before it's too late
Before you are six or seven or eight
To hate all the people your relatives hate
You've got to be carefully taught
Children may not obey but children will listen
Children will look to you for which way to turn
How can you say to a child who's in flight
What can you say that no matter how slight
Only whatever you put in its head
Things that your mother and father had said
Which were left to them too
Temper with what is true and children will turn
Put your hand on her waist and stand
With her right in your left hand
Take the someone whose arms you're in
Hold onto her tight and spin
Well my heart is about to burst
My head is about to pop
Glide and step and then step and glide
You could learn to polka if you worked a week or so
Or the tango filled with passion seething
I might join the chorus of the castle garden show
For my heart is about to burst
My head is about to pop
Make the music weave a spell
Whirl away your worry
Things look almost twice as well
When you're slightly blurry
As around and around you go
Your spirits will hit the top
And now that we're dancing
Who cares if we ever stop
And now that we're dancing
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
Some day my prince will come
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
And steal a kiss or two
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
I'll find my love some day
The day when my dreams come true
It's darker than the dark bottom
It rumbles more than the rumba
Just take a look at this number
It's got that certain swing
That makes you wanna sing
Doing the reactionary
Close your eyes to where you're bound
Doing the reactionary
All the best dictators do it
The four hundred love to sing it
Hands up high and shake your head
Doing the reactionary
Doing the reactionary
Close your eyes to where you're bound
Doing the reactionary
All the best dictators do it
The four hundred love to sing it
Hands up high and shake your head
Here is where you belong...
And then there were none
I've always wanted the chance
I only wish one of you are here with me
To see how great it is
I was meant for me...
I stroll the lane together...
Pick to me upon my knee...
I'll go my way by myself
It's how the comedy ends
I'll have to deny myself
Love and laughter and friend
I'll try to apply myself
And teach my heart how to sing
I'll go my way by myself
Like a bird on the wing
I'll face the unknown
I'll build the world of my own
No one knows better than I myself
Hear the waves on your skin
Like a call from within
Hear my voice where you are
Take a train steal a car
Have you gone to the moon
Come in pain or in joy
Perfume of flowers I missed
Bee in her bonnet kissed
A flock of blue birds
Flew out cooing merrily
The doorbell could speak
Witness to my hearts echo
Time would be redeemed
Witness to memory stream
I give you proof when you want
The day never should end
Until the violets turn red
Perfume of flowers I missed
Who can move and groove
A guy who can date lo
Better chances with me than her
One in a million chance
Who can move and groove
A guy who doesn't lie
I wanna guy who's hot
Who can move and groove
Acting like a born aristocrat
If you ain't got elegance
You can never ever carry it off
Exercise your wildest whims tonight
Silver spoons were used for feeding us
If you ain't got elegance
You can never ever carry it off
Some were born with rags and patches but
We use dollar bills for matches and
We were born with elegance
When the streets are full of mud
Have you noticed when I hold my cup
The saucer never moves
Indubitably proves that
We got built in elegance
And with elegance... elegance...
Elegance... elegance... elegance
If you ain't got elegance
You can never ever carry it off
It's so nice to have you here
Life was awfully flat
Dolly will never go away...
Put on you Sunday clothes
When you feel dawn and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about
That Sunday shine is a certain sign
That you feel as fine as you look
Take the someone whose arms you're in
Hold onto her tight and spin
But my arms felt sure and strong
It only takes a moment
To be loved a whole life long...
To bring you the sweet things
One of your old favorite songs
That's just what I need
Dave is still her slave
Open your heart and from out of the skies
A prince on a horse will materialize
Big letters that high
You don't have to buy
Hear a voice talk back
Whose uppers and lowers
Will click when he'll speak
The man that you select
Must treat you with respect
He must understand there
Not toy with your morals
We may never meet again
We won't say good night until the last minute
I will hold out my hand
This may only be a dream
We come and we go like a ripple on the stream
Tomorrow may never come
Someday we may meet again
Ooh... there's no telling where or when
People are born to love and be happy
And a cloudy sky can lead to a rainbow
If you're lucky to find a special man
You gotta love him all you can
And anything he wants from you
Should be the least that you can do
Don't let his dreams turn into dust
If you're the one to share his world
Just be the someone he can trust
You can live in a castle
And dream of your diamonds
Four little angels of peace are we
Loving our neighbors so peacefully
There's really no harm if we do not disarm
For we always in close harmony
Four little angels of peace are we
There is one thing on which we agree
With fall or with friend
We will fight to the end
Though we butchered the boss
And I've own made the choice
And slaughter the Irish no end
Though I'm injured and poor
Slaying hoard upon hoard
We're but playing the part of a friend
But we'll be elected for peace
Except in the case of the crook
We conquered both spears
Now we're up to our ears
Just trying to keep what we took
Three little angels of peace are we
Living together so blissfully
Three little angels of peace are we
There is one thing on which we agree
We'll break each other's necks
In Japan we've the right
But the emperor knows peace is finer
It isn't our fault it's a case of absurd
We're picked down and buried by china
I glad did it for the world
We're a nation of poets and thinkers
And lay west to his city
It's because all the Chinese are stinkers
Two little angels of peace are we
Living together in amity
We'll sign any pack saying we won't attack
But it's just a mere formality
Two little angels of peace are we
There is one thing on which we agree
Now I know that our war
Is a thing to have horror
And that peaceful fill out
With our love from the start
I atrocious did all my part
To civilize nearly the hope we have
Though you call me sadistic
My armies required a quarry
And though we may slave
What's a splendid day today
After all that we'll say that we're sorry
Though I fall for the urge
Of a nice bloody purge
And living my way I was carrying on
My ambitions are small
I want nothing at all
My plans wouldn't be any littler
Four little angels of peace are we
Though we slaughter the meek
We confirm every week
And we talk it over peacefully
Four little angels of peace are we
There is one thing on which we agree
We'll shout and we'll shell
We'll get each other's hell
I met a boy called frank mills
On September twelfth right here
He was last seen with his friend
But he wears his hair
Tied in a small bow at the back
But it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
And wears this white crash helmet
He has gold chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
I would gratefully appreciate it
If you see him tell him
I'm in the park with my girlfriend
I just keep them in stitches
And though I may be all wrong for a guy
I guess it's not funny
Life is far from sunny
When the laugh is over
And the joke's on you
That's one thing you really need for sure
When you're a funny girl
How it ain't so funny
You don't have to shout
What's more I can't stand your cigarette brand
I'm unhappy with things the way they've occurred
It is time to face facts and not mince a word
And I'll tell you why
A funny thing happened on my way to love
I lost the young fellow I've been dreaming of
He changed while I waited and hoped for his call
Into someone who's no fun at all
So I'll start forgetting
And much thanks for letting me practice on you
It's farewell my lovely
Excuse please my dust
Unravel and travel and lust
It's with a pleasant glow I realize
If I have that much love so deep true and strong
All ready to hand my dear mister wrong
I'll give to my own mister right.
The world will keep turning but nut around you
There's someone else waiting who's more than a friend
Best wishes and dishes I'll send
If I had this much love so deep true and strong
All ready to hand you my dear mister wrong
Just think of the treasures the joy and delight
Now it's time to say goodnight
Now the sun turns out his light
Dream sweet dreams for me.
Dream sweet dreams for you
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Now the moon begins to shine
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Now the sun turns out his light
Dream sweet dream for me
Dream sweet dreams for you
Out on the street anybody you meet got a heartache of their own
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't wanna hear your goodbye
Little by little we meet in the middle
There's danger in the dark
Make it a crime to be out in the cold
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't wanna hear your goodbye
Don't wanna hear your goodbye
I don't wanna hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
Don't wanna hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of
It's so nice to have you here
Life was awfully flat
Dolly will never go away...
Put on you Sunday clothes
When you feel dawn and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about
That Sunday shine is a certain sign
Take the someone whose arms you're in
Hold onto her tight and spin
But my arms felt sure and strong
It only takes a moment
To be loved a whole life long...
To bring you the sweet things
One of your old favorite songs
It's so nice to be back home where I belong
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
Promise you'll never go away again
I went away from the lights of fourteenth street
And into my personal haze
But now that I'm back in the lights of 14th street
Tomorrow will be brighter than the good old days
Dolly's overjoyed and overwhelmed and over par
I hear the ice tinkle
Do you hear the ice tinkle
See the lights twinkle
Can you see the lights twinkle
And you still get glances from us handsome men
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
I hear the ice tinkle
See the lights twinkle
And you still get glances from us handsome men
Where there's love overflowing
Wind that makes the tall grass bend into leaning
Suddenly the raindrops that fall they have a meaning
Maybe there's a chance for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Suddenly my world's gone and changed its face
But I still know where I'm going
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growing
To know if we should believe the things that we see
Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy
But it's taught me to love so it's real to me
And I've learned that we must look inside our hearts to find
A world full of love like yours and mine
I think of a peaceful world enjoy all around me
Love like we shared can never be taken away from me
It well may be he's bringing me a cheering word.
It well may be it's followed me across the seas.
The mist of May is in the gloaming
And all the clouds are holding still
Through the heather on the hill
And all I want to do is wander
Through the heather on the hill.
There may be other days as rich and rare.
There may be other springs as full and fair.
There will be violins playing softly
I shall be flying through rainbows
And when he lowers his lips to kiss me
His arms could crush me but he will hold me gently
And as the dawn slowly opens one eye
Hey buds below ... up is where to grow
Up with which below can't compare with.
What with not a soul there to share with
Make the queen of bees hot as brandy
Come give at least a preview of easter
Come up and see the good we're giving
Come up and see the grounds for living
I am softer to the touch
It's a feeling you like feeling very much
You are someone whom I've admired
Still our friendship leaves something to be desired
How strange the feeling
I never dreamed it could be
I feel alive and free
Up to the ceiling I like him
I never dreamed it could be
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
With you forever and I'd be glad
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
He's gonna handle me and hold me so
But when he calls I know I have to go
Because the sorrow of the past is all
Now the real happiness is just begun
There's no wrinkle on my brow
And summer time and winter time
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
With you forever and I'd be glad
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
He's gonna handle me and hold me so
But when he calls I know I have to go
Because the sorrow of the past is all
Now the real happiness is just begun
There's no wrinkle on my brow
And summer time and winter time
I have dreams for you and me
And wishes that will last and live beyond eternity
As the years go by I promise you that I
I will be the one to run to when the nights are long
I'll be there when winds begin to blow
Even when it seems that everything is going wrong
Though everything we have could never end
And through rain or shine and every cloudy sky
I will be the one to run to when the nights are long
I'll be there when winds begin to blow
Even when it seems that everything is going wrong
You'll know where I am
Anytime you're lost just turn around
And I will be your light in the night and I promise that
Even when it seems that everything is going wrong
I'd rather be blue thinking of you
I'd rather be blue over you
Than be happy with somebody else
And I'm knocking on wood
It's so hard to be good
I'd rather be blue thinking of you
I'd rather be blue over you
Than be happy with somebody else
There'll be no iceman there
I'd rather be blue thinking of you
I'd rather be blue over you
Than be happy with somebody else
I'd rather be blue over you
Than be happy with somebody else
It's so hard to be good
I'd rather be blue over you
Than be happy with somebody else
While you're away I'm here to say
There'll be no ice man there
Singing the blues I'm gonna use
Nothing but Frigidaire
I'd rather be blue over you
Than be happy with somebody else
I'd rather be blue over you
But I don't have a minute
I must meet with the mad hatter.
For a very important date
And when I wave I lose all the time I save
My fuzzy ears and whiskers took me too much time to shave
I wish that I could fly
And he's getting worse
He'd be in bed with a graduate nurse
A couple of big specialists
High priced consultation
And outside waiting in the hall
Assorted logic small poor relations
His aches have got aches
His pains are in pain
And what sizzles and frizzles
Inside there all the smartest professors could not explain
All the medical doctors
They're amazed I'm still here
I should own a pharmacy
For just my prescriptions
My bills for only pills alone
Would chill you to the bone
What I have been through
It would make your heart break
And play a story that only
Turn yet it maybe could write
Gold statue sometimes
Now one day you're hailed for blazing trails
Next you're nailed for fingernails
Now I've kept my clothes and kept me space
I've kept my nose to spite my face
Still once you say you won't
Keep your place loud and clear
Once you announce you're directing all you hear is
Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade
Who told you you're allowed to rain on my parade
I guess I didn't make it
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade
I'm gonna live and live now
One roll for the whole shebang
One throw that bell will go clang
Eye on the target and wham
I guess I didn't make it
I've always loved singing theater songs because they tell a story
If a girl isn't pretty
Is a nose with deviation
Should I throw her into jail
Like a ring you're buying retail
Be a standard size that
Fits a standard dress
When a girl's incidentals
Are no bigger than two lentils
Then to me that doesn't spell success
Because she doesn't look like the others
If a girl isn't pretty
She should dump the stage
And try another route
Any guy who pays a quarter
And that map of yours just ain't no
But the damn thing don't come out right
If a girl isn't pretty
If a girl isn't pretty
If a girl isn't pretty
If a girl isn't pretty
If a girl isn't pretty
When I fall you're my place to mend
If you run out of reasons to try
I'll love enough for both you and I
I'll be the one you can run to
I'd rather go through any pain love puts us through
Than to spend one day without you by my side
A flame in the darkness
Ooh and through all space and time
I'd rather go through any pain love puts us through
Than to spend one day without you by my side
And I can't remember life without you the way it used to be
Feels like a million years away
But hold me till the angels sing
Tell me every little thing
Promise me forever from this day
Even more than you know
Even more than you know
If I were the only girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter in the world today
We could go on loving in the same old way
With nothing to harm our joy
I would say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do
If were the only girl in the world
And you were the only boy
If I were the only girl
Nothing else would matter in the world today
We could go on loving in the same sweet way
With nothing to change our joy
I would say such wonderful things to you
There would be such beautiful things to do
If were the only girl in the world
It was more fun to be children
We just took life as it happened
Over wink of an eye and it's over
What a surprise to discover
We were people ourselves
What kind of people did we want to be
No answer ever came to me
I didn't sleep at all last night
But what my hear says
It only took a moment
Your eyes begin to open
As is you had awoken from a sleep
It only took a moment
And lose you concentration
When someone drops his name
You're back in his arms as always
Your daydreams work out that way
It's all just a trick you mind plays
The more it stays the same
Same little girl who's frightened
Same little girl who's sure
That she loves her so
Sees with a woman's vision knows what a woman knows
It only takes a moment
We've reach for our tomorrow's
And know we won't be lonely
In laugher and in sorrows
And that is all that love's about
And we'll recall when time runs out
That it only took a moment
To be loved a whole life long
And know we won't be lonely
In laugher and in sorrows
And that is all that love's about
And we'll recall when time runs out
That it only took a moment
It takes a woman to quietly plan
And to gently lead him
Where fortune can find him
And not let him know that the power behind
Was that dainty woman
It takes a woman to quietly plan
And to gently lead him
Where fortune can find him
And not let him know that the power behind
Was that dainty woman
Then I went on to the big time
I got daisies in green pastures
Who could ask for anything more
Round and round and round my door
Who can ask for anything more
Johnny can only play one note
And the note he plays is this
This is just a little samba
Built upon a single note
Other notes are bound to follow
But the root is still
Now this new one is the consequence
Of the one we've just concluded
As I'm bound to be the unavoidable
There's so many people who can
I have used to go the scale
I know that at the end
So I come back to my first note
As I must come back to you
I will pour into that one note
All the love I feel for you
Anyone who wants the whole show
Re mi fa sol la ti do
He would find himself with no show
Better play the note you know
Time after time I tell myself
When things seemed so dark
I walked up to Ray Stark
Ms. Streisand sang and I played
Just you do your job and I'll do mine
Which just goes to show
How much producers know
You all know the switch
I tell myself that I'm
When things seemed so dark
I walked up to Ray Stark
Ms. Streisand sang and I played
Just you do your job and I'll do mine
Which just goes to show
How much producers know
You all know the switch
Just name that kind of man your sister wants
And she'll snatch them up
Don't forget to bring your maiden aunts and
She's the one the spinsters recommend
She even find a lovely bride
Like furniture and daffodils and lives.
Just leave everything to me.
Just leave everything to me.
For a rather modest fee.
I'll arrange for making all arrangements
Just leave everything to me.
Just leave everything to me.
Just leave everything to me.
With a ten year guarantee.
I'll proceed to plan the whole procedure
Just leave everything to me.
Just leave everything to me.
Just leave everything to me.
I'll discretely use my own discretion
I'll arrange for making all arrangements
I'll proceed to plan the whole procedure
Though it won't be like the first time
Don't look for shooting stars
For love is only love
You touch and still you touch the ground
Don't listen for those bells
For love is only love
And if it's love you've found
Your heart won't hear a sound
And you hold his hand
You only hold his hand
The violins are all a bluff
But if you're really wise
The silence of his eyes
And it's wonderful enough
Without the shooting star
Without the sounds of bells
You've been a fool and so have i
But come I'll be your wife
And let us try before we die
To make some sense of life
We're neither pure nor wise nor good
We'll do the best we know
We'll build our house and chop our wood
And make our garden grow
And make our garden grow
I thought the world was sugar cake
For so our master said
But now I'll teach my hands to bake
Our loaf of daily bread
We're neither pure nor wise nor good
We'll do the best we know
We'll build house and chop our wood
And make our garden grow
And make our garden grow
Let dreamers dream what worlds they please
Are grown in solid ground
We're neither pure nor wise nor good
We'll do the best we know
We'll build our house and chop our wood
And make our garden grow
One less bell to answer
One less man to pick up after
I only know that since he left
Though I try to forget
It just can't be done
Each time the doorbell rings
I don't know haw in the world
To stop thinking of him
I end each day the way I started
One less bell to answer
Even when there's no one sitting there
But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
To hold you tight and no one there
You can kiss goodnight
A room is still a room
Even when there's nothing ever gloom
But a room is not a house
And a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart
Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
Don't let one mistake keep us apart
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stairs and turn the key
One less bell to answer
Each time the doorbell rings I still run
Has the moon lost her memory
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan
I can dream of the old days
Every street lamp seems to beat
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning
I must think of a new life and I mustn't give in
Tonight will be a memory too and a new day will begin
Burnt out ends of smoky days
The still cold smell of morning
Another day is dawning
All alone with the memory of my days in the sun
He never paid no income taxes
He never paid no income taxes
It vanished slowly overhead
The Finger wrote and having written
It vanished slowly overhead
And this is what the writing of the Good Lord said
I have only got a minute
I have only got a minute
That is all the time I have
To sing this tiny little minute waltz
It isn't easy but I'll try it then
I've got to say goodbye
But first I'll take a minute
Every note that you may know
That less I sing a little minute waltz
And hope I can sing with no faults
I know it's difficult
I'll give it every last breath that I've got within my body
Hope that my performance won't be very shoddy
Singing every moment won't do wonders for my throat
I probably will end up hoarse
Of course I will I've got it down a wager
That I made I will I want
I know it's not the money but the
Satisfaction that I get from winning money
On this silly kind of bet
Though this kind of solo wasn't his intention
Chopin isn't here to make an intervention
So with your permission
I will sing each note
That that composer wrote
As you can hear my trilling
I wasn't very willing
To attempt a thing that's not been done
And just for fun to sing the minute waltz
As I sing the seconds fly
All too soon the minute waltzes by
And now I ask you where am I
Halfway through the tune and I'm falling far behind
I have less than thirty seconds
Less than thirty seconds
Less than half a minute
I have less than thirty seconds
I have less than half a minute
To complete this little minute waltz
But every note that's in the score I buy
The sands of time I know are pouring at me
Down to some big store and there to buy a honey
And a trophy for myself
To put upon the shelf
To show the world I've won
And though I'd like to end this torture with a smile
And lest someone knows how to stop the clock
You're gonna see me cry
But I'm afraid my little lungs will burst before too long
If only I can last this day
Between the very dead of night and day
Upon a steely sheet of light I'll lay
I'll give myself to you
And dress myself in dew
Before the cloak of night reveals the morn
Time holds it's breathe while it conceals the dawn
All sound is frozen still
Your skin will warm the chill
I feel it's fingers lingers the veil of night shade
Light made from stars that all too soon fall
Between our eyes the only sight I've seen
And each second in it
Will leave a glow upon the sky
This will be my shining hour
Calm and happy and bright
In my dreams your face will flower
Through the darkness of the night
Like the lights of home before me
Or an angel watching over me
This will be my shining hour
Like the lights of home before me
Or an angel watching over me
This will be my shining hour
Let's take it nice and easy
It's gonna be so easy
For us to fall in love
Hey baby what's your hurry
Relax and don't you worry
We're gonna fall in love
But let's make all the stops along the way
The problem now of course is
To simply hold your horses
To rush would be a crime
Sit back and let it happen
I think it's all just fallen into place
So let's start getting cozy
The future's looking rosy
Those bells are bound to chime
Nice and easy does it
I want love and I want kissing I want more of what I'm missing
Nobody comes knocking at my front door
Oh dear what can the matter be
A date is on the can of coffee that I buy
Never will be any use to me at all.
Oh dear what can the matter be
Nobody makes a pass at me.
And up above I'm dressed in the brassier of the week
I want attention and things I can't mention
And I want them all before I get too old
Just like I result of 99 and 44
It's not cricket to picket not cricket
You haven't any right you know
You're acting in great haste
Just think of the predicament
In which your boss is placed
It's an exceedingly bad taste
Not cricket to picket not cricket
It's not cricket to picket not cricket
Atrocious and gauche you know to picket
Go home and starve like gentlemen
Not like a noisy brood
Real ladies never make a fuss
Though they like clothes and food
And money's never talked about
For that would be quite rude
Not cricket to picket not cricket
It's not picket to cricket not picket
Uncultured and unmannerly to picket
You know you're misbehaving now
You mustn't lose your mind
You're being so inelegant
And frankly quite unkind
Excuse my indiscretion
But you're older than refined
Not picket to cricket not picket
It ain't ticket to stick it not picket
Get each man there a cricket
Would ask in such a vulgar way
I beg you get the hell away
You lousy bunch of...
You don't seem to know who I am
Pretending he's beside me
I walk with him till morning
I feel his arms around me
And when I lose my way
I close my eyes and he has found me
The pavement shines like silver
All the lights are misty in the river
The trees are full of starlight
And all I see is him and me forever
That I'm talking to myself
And although I know that he is blind
But when the night is over
And the river's just a river
The world around me changes
The trees are barren everywhere
And the streets are full of strangers
But everyday I'm learning
I've only been pretending
His world will go on turning
The world is full of happiness
That I have never known
I've decided the only way I can woo
But don't say I'll say no
Then it's not too late to negotiate
I'm on a campaign to make you mine
I'll picket you until you sign
In one big union for two
No courts and junction can make me stop
Until your love is all closed shop
In one big union for two
Seven days a week I want the right
To call you mine both day and night
The hours may be long
But fifty million union members can't be wrong
When we have joined up perhaps there'll be
A new recruit or two or three
For that's what team work can do
In one big union for two
We'll never need to arbitrate
In one big union for two
No stabbing when I'm out of town
In one big union for two
And a kiss each night
Our life will be a song
Fifty million union members can't be wrong
When we have signed up and made the grade
Who looks like me and like you
The fields will be green
The skies will be blue
The rivers will be bright silver ribbons
Running round the hills
The rains will be soft
The winds will be sweet
Oh sweeter than springtime
A child full of wonder
Won't fear the dark sound of thunder
When a soldier is a stranger
One less bell to answer
One less man to pick up after
I don't know how in the world to stop thinking of him
I end each day the way I started
One less bell to answer
One less man to pick up after
A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sitting there
But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
You can kiss goodnight
A room is still a room
Even when there's nothing there but gloom
But a room is not a house
And a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
Don't let one mistake keep us apart
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stairs and turn the key
Each time the doorbell rings I still run
I got one less man to pick up after
Fingers only touch along
Still between us we've got
We've got our corner of the night
We're gonna get along all right
We've got our corner of the night
What we've got it may not show
Still we're richer than we know
We can always run and hide
Where the world can never
People who got rhythm
Are the luckiest people
Don't bring around the cloud to rain on my parade...
I got daisies in green pastures
I got daisies in green pastures
I got daisies in green pastures
Who could ask for anything more
Who could ask for anything more
Dreams that should have lasted
Told each other secrets
I'll never let go of the memories
Something always seems
Footsteps that I hear
Make me think you're near me
Boats that never sailed
We're more for having loved one another
Someday when someone else's arms are around us
When time has put some distance between us
The years will kindly show
Our memories come and go
They ebb and flow like the tide
There are quiet places in my heart
Sitting in the window or
Standing on the stair
Something in them cheers the air
Glancing stay forever
Blowing out their candles or
Combing out their hair
Here's to the ladies who lunch
Lounging in their caftans and
Here's to the girls who just watch
It's a bottle of scotch
Another chance to disapprove
Another brilliant zinger
Another reason not to move
Another vodka stinger
Here's to the girls who play wife
Just to keep in touch
The ones who follow the rules
And meet themselves at the schools
Too busy to know that they're fools
How they make a man sing
A toast to that invincible bunch
The dinosaurs surviving the crunch
Let's hear it for the ladies who lunch
Pretty women at their mirrors
Window shopping table hopping
Pretty women giving parties
I've never been wrong
I always hear your voice
And in my dreams I hear you calling my name...
Some kind of light shines from your face
And I can't turn away
I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes
I've been taken and I've been hypnotized
I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes
I've been taken and I've been hypnotized
And your eyes say everything
You want to keep me here forever
One minute's so sincere
Then you completely turn against me and I'm afraid
You don't have to say you love me
I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes
I'm like e prisoner captured by your eyes
I've been taken and I've been hypnotized
Full of shine and full of sparkle
There's lots of world out there
We're gonna find adventure in the evening air
Girls in white in a perfumed night
And we'll close the town in a whirl
Put on your Sunday clothes when you feel down and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about
That Sunday shine is a certain sign
That makes you feel brand new down to your toes
Your beads and buckles and bows
For there's no blue Monday in your Sunday...
No Monday in your Sunday...
Put on your Sunday clothes when you feel down and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about
That Sunday shine is a certain sign
That makes you feel brand new down to your toes
Get out your feathers
Your beads and buckles and bows
Put on your Sunday clothes when you feel down and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about
That Sunday shine is a certain sign
Beneath your bowler brim the world's a simple song
A lovely lilt that makes you tilt your nose
Your red suspenders and hose
Put on your Sunday clothes there's lots of world out there
Put on your silk cravat and patent shoes
We're gonna find adventure in the evening air
Put on your silk high hat and at the turned up cuff
We'll wear a hand made gray suede buttoned glove
And this I'm positive of
That we won't come home
No we won't come home
I'll be wearing ribbons down my back this summer
Blue and green and streaming in the yellow sky
So if someone special comes my way this summer
He might notice me passing by
And so I'll try to make it easier to find me
In the silliness of July
Because a breeze might stir a rainbow up behind me
That might happen to catch the gentleman's eye
And he might smile and take me by the hand
Making me recall how lovely love can be
And so I will proudly wear
You're gonna be surprised how your torso feels
The ever lovely roller skate rag is on the top
We've just been introduced
I do not know you well
But when the music started
Something drew me to your side
So many men and girls
Are in each other's arms
We might be similarly occupied
On a bright cloud of music
Shall we then be together
That this kind of thing can happen
Hello young lovers whoever you are
Be brave young lovers and follow your star
On a bright cloud of music
Shall we still be together
With our arms around each other
That this kind of thing can happen
We've just been introduced
I do not know you well
But when the music started
Something drew me to your side
So many men and girls
Are in each other's arms
We might be similarly occupied
On a bright cloud of music
Shall we then be together
That this kind of thing can happen
Hello young lovers whoever you are
Be brave young lovers and follow your star
On a bright cloud of music
Shall we still be together
With our arms around each other
That this kind of thing can happen
They simply make me nap
And ditties romantic drive me nearly frantic
I think they're all full of pap
Why sing of stars above
For while we are waiting father time's creating
New things to be singing of
Sing me a song with social significance
All other tunes are taboo
Sing me a song with social significance
Or you can sing till you're blue
Sing me of wars and sing me of breadlines
Tell me of front page news
Sing me of strikes and last minute headlines
Sing me a song with social significance
There's nothing else that will do
It must get hot with what is what
I want a song that's satirical
And putting the mere into miracle
It must be packed with social fact
Tell me of mills and mines
Sing me of courts that aren't impartial
Sing me a song with social significance
There's nothing else that will do
It must be tense with common sense
Make it simple to last your whole life long
Don't worry that it's not good enough
For anyone else to hear
Happy days are here again
The skies above are clear again
So let's tell the world
Happy days are here again
Your cares and troubles are gone
There'll be no more from now on
Happy days are here again
Sing of good things not bad
Sing of happy not sad
Make it simple to last your whole life long
Don't worry that it's not good enough
For anyone else to hear
There's only one song worth singing
They may try and sell ya
To see someone like you
You've gotta make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind of music
Even if nobody else sings along
Make it simple to last your whole life long
Don't worry that it's not good enough
For anyone else to hear
Even if nobody else sings along
Sing of good things not bad
Sing of happy not sad.
Make it simple to last
Don't worry that it's not
Good enough for anyone
Let the world sing along
Sing of love there could be
Sing for you and for me.
Make it simple to last
Don't worry that it's not
Good enough for anyone
Wave your little hand and whisper
You ain't gonna see me anymore
And when you discover that your life is dreary
So wave your little hand and whisper
Because you've treated me so rotten and rough
So wave your little hand and whisper
To a fancy new address
On board that happiness express
I'm gonna learn to dance and drink and smoke a cigarette
You can snuggle up to your cash register.
I'll be all dolled up
When you see your dolly shuffle off to glory
Oh I should have said so long...
The dawn is filled with dreams
One must be right for me
Which dream of all the dreams
When there's a dream for every star
And there are oh so many stars
The wind is filled with songs
One must be right for me
Which song of all the songs
When there's a song for every star
That I have searched so many eyes
That I have searched so many eyes
And the dawn might come too soon
When the songbird in the willow
Sings a soft and soulful tune
As it slowly sails above us
In it's solitary flight
As it bathes us in it's light
Say that we can spent the day
Through a sunlit afternoon
Say that we can spent the day here
Through a sunlit afternoon
Then take your books and follow me to 1776 ad
And as the history page is turned we will see what we can learn
Stop giving out with this here liberty jive
Don't sing of people's rights that way
They might believe in what you say
So stop your song it's not polite
Pipe down before you start a fight
You can't stand still on freedom's track
And sitting on your status quo
Why start up trouble for the king
This freedom racket is a corny thing
You'll never get them in the groove
And play with the guys that have the dough
You can't stand still on freedom's track
And sitting on your status quo
And that boy rode to town one night
Sang to the farmers near and far
You're manners aren't nice at all
The right people don't sing like that
You can't stand still on freedom's track
And sitting on your status quo
Keep stepping to that freedom hop
To keep you sitting on your status quo
When they say let's stand still a bit
Remember those are just the tricks
That did not work in 76
And do what all those others said
You can't stand still on freedom's track
And sitting on your status ...
I need your sweet inspiration
I need you here on my mind
Every hour of the day
Without your sweet inspiration
The lonely hours of the night
Wanting you the way I do
I only want to be with you
And I would go to the ends of the earth
Anywhere you tell me to
I will follow where you lead
If you're out on the road
All you gotta do is call my name
And I'll be there on the next train
Where you lead I will follow
Anywhere you tell me to
I will follow where you lead
I'd always wanted a real home
With flowers on the windowsill
But if you want to leave in New York City
I never thought I could get satisfaction
If anyone can keep me happy
I'm gonna follow where you lead me
I'm gonna follow where you lead me
I need your sweet inspiration
I need you here on my mind
Every hour of the day
Without your sweet inspiration
The lonely hours of the night
That's all I ask from you
I gotta have your sweet inspiration
What a satisfied woman might do
You know I just look back in my mind
And a bucket of power every hour of the day
I need your sweet inspiration
Baby you're just what I need
That's all I ask from you
I gotta have your sweet inspiration
You know there just ain't no telling
What a satisfied woman can do
And how I love to watch it change expressions.
Each look becomes the pride of my possessions.
But never will these eyes behold a sight that could replace
It's got my crazy heart in such a tangle
It drives me simply wild from an angle
He laughs and spring goes right out of style.
And oh the thrill I feel each time my fingers gently trace
No painter or photographer could catch it
No rainbow or no sunset that could match it
What view completes my universe
Transcending time and space
Bird up above see what he's got
The freedom to fly and the freedom to not
Look at him go way up above
Look at the crow he's as free as the dove
He owns the clear blue
Could be there's one beam up there for me
Bird up above man in a tree
Don't have to fly but he's gotta be free
Bird up above see what he got
The freedom to fly and the freedom to not
Don't have to go to the back of the sky
Wake up you glum bird
Help us overcome bird
Freedom has slumbered for too long
Bird up above man up a tree
Don't have to fly but he gotta be free
Have to find the thing that he's after
Hey bird... you can show him the way bird
You can show him today bird
And a megabyte was a really big nosh
And if it was a virus you got
Internet or interface
Once... a floppy disk meant you had a bum back
I used to find a channel quicker
When all you needed was one clicker
But now my clicker has a clicker
And each new clicker makes me sicker
If I could only find a clicker
I gotta thank my luck stars above
We got a first rate act
It's evident when we make love
You're my every thought
You're my own attraction
You must be heaven's saint
You give me so much satisfaction
You make life worth fighting for
And there is nobody quite like you
And it's my conclusion
There is no sweeter scent
When you have found the right solution
You make life worth fighting for
And there is nobody quite like you
I gotta thank my luck stars above
We got a first rate act
It's evident when we make love
Seek and you shall find what you may already have.
Sometimes it's your own shadow standing in your path.
I feel a change in the tide
As I hold my heart open wide.
Knew what I could be.
I never felt the power inside of me.
Now I stand in all the wonder
That the mirror couldn't see.
I have the power inside of me.
I feel like today's the day I finally was born.
I can do more than fantasize.
Knew what I could be.
I never felt the power inside of me.
Now I stand in all the wonder
I say love it is a flower and you it's only seed
It's the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance
And the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live
Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snow
A smile and then we knew at once that here we are involved again
And all the things we said we couldn't bare again are there again
I can't deny I've tried another's arms
And maybe you have too
But even lost inside another's arms
Just empty feelings coupled with the wondering why
What words we said or left unsaid
Imagining what could have been or should have been
Just empty feelings coupled with the wondering why
What words we said or left unsaid
Imagining what could have been or should have been
Can't you see when you look at me
I'm all over fluffy white
I wouldn't peck at you or bite
And have tiny twinkle toes to dance upon
So you just gotta have a swan
Or you're out of luck
And besides you couldn't say
You are missing you are button
Where upon where upon
A chicken or a duck is a mistake
And love is in the wind
Like some music in a dream
You made them all come true
When you came inside of my life
And lost in your eyes
I could spend all of my time
Hearing songs you sing
Feeling love you bring
Darling being close to you
Made all my dreams come true
When you came inside my life
Try to remember the kind of September
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green And grain was yellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When you were a tender And callow fellow
Try to remember and if you remember
Try to remember When life was so tender
That no one wept except the willow
Try to remember when life was so tender
When love was an ember About to billow
Try to remember and if you remember
Deep in December It's nice to remember
Although you know The snow will follow
Deep in December It's nice to remember
The fire of September That made us mellow
Deep in December Our hearts should remember
In a very unusual way one time I needed you.
In a very unusual way you were my friend.
In a very unusual way I think I'm in love with you.
In a very unusual way I want to cry.
Something inside me surrenders.
You're the reason why
You don't have a clue.
You can't tell what it's like to be me looking at you.
Since the first day that I met you.
You'll observe a curious exchange of energy
Are you a figment of my imagination
Your eyes are like fingers
They're touching my body
Riding the passion arising inside me
I see the hunger arise in your eyes
And it's urging me on
Higher and harder and faster and farther
Maybe I'll teach you at least that you've
Got to be free when you fall
I'm the master magician
Who's setting you free
From the lies you've been told
When you're breaking your back
Bring your last straw to me
I turn straw into gold
Those small misfortunes all start to pile up
And it gets harder to keep a smile up
That we'll get lucky one fine day
Then once again fate gives us the finger
Once again with a sigh
We look up to the sky
Someone up there is getting careless
Makes no difference if a man is slave or king born
He always is to pain and suffering
When did he understand just why he's here
Clap comes from the dark
A big smack on the rear
From then on continuous without a stop
Science keeps advancing always on the run
All they seem to do is take from life the fun
It wears your heart away
Drinking shrinks for you the level day by day
You weighted down to check
Future generations we are all to one
What are they doing...
What are they doing...
What are they doing...
What are they doing...
Those small misfortunes all start to pile up
And it gets harder to keep a smile up
That we'll get lucky one fine day
Then once again fate gives us the finger
Once again with a sigh
We look up to the sky
With a quizzical eye and quietly say
Someone up there is getting careless
Makes no difference if a man is slave or king born
He always is to pain and suffering
Clap comes from the dark
A big smack on the rear
From then on continuous without a stop
Science keeps advancing always on the run
All they seem to do is take from life the fun
Future generations we are all to one
If you miss me in this life you can catch me in the next.
I don't know why they redesigned me
He likes the way he used to find me
He likes the girl I left behind me
I mean he... I mean me...
What did I do that I don't do the way I did before
Beckons to him no more
All the wear and the tear
Performed by Barbra Streisand
I hear sweet songs about the moon
Songs about the stars above
And songs of love and June
Songs of hearts that beat as one
To some sweet lovers tune
But they're not songs that sing for me
Songs about the dream that lies
Within a lover's eyes
Songs about the cloudless sky
Songs about the joys of love
But there not songs that sing for me
Cold hungry days and sighing
If life's just a race
To keep your heart from crying
Let the poet sing of skies above
And hearts that dance
For the call of romance
All that makes life worth living
Even a thing worth giving
You can keep your little songs
That sing of all the joy that love can bring
You can keep your little songs
That sing of all the joy that love can bring
It's not how long we held each other's hands
What matters is how well we loved each other
It's not how far we've traveled on our way
But what we found to say
It's not the springs we've see
But all the shades of green
It's not how long I held you in my arms
What matters is how sweet the years together
It's not how many summertimes
We have to give to fall
The early morning smiles
What matters most is that we loved at all
It's not how many summertimes
We have to give to fall
The laughter and the tears
We held on to our pride when we left each other
But what good is pride tonight when we're all alone
Looking for something better
Reaching for more than love
Too late we both discovered
We're lost without each other
Tonight I stay awake wanting just to call you
Knowing my heart would break if you were not home
You know the saddest part of all is I know you're there
Why do we run from the arms of love
When we really need each other more than ever
Looking for something better
Reaching for more than love
Too late we both discovered
We're lost without each other
Why were we so blind it was right here all the time
Looking for something better
Reaching for more than love
Too late we both discovered
Looking for something better
Reaching for more than love
We held on to our pride when we left each other
But what good is pride tonight when we're all alone
Looking for something better
Reaching for more than love
Too late we both discovered
We're lost without each other
Tonight I stay awake wanting just to call you
Knowing my heart would break if you were not home
You know the saddest part of all is I know you're there
Why do we run from the arms of love
When we really need each other more than ever
Looking for something better
Reaching for more than love
Too late we both discovered
We're lost without each other
Why were we so blind it was right here all the time
Looking for something better
Reaching for more than love
Too late we both discovered
Looking for something better
Reaching for more than love
Like a giant juggernaut
On a cruise to freak you out
We could fly a helicopter
Nothing left to talk about
I'll be back to frame you
When I grow up I'll be stable
When I grow up I'll turn the tables
Trying hard to fit among you
Floating out to wonderland
Damn the consequences
When I grow up I'll be stable
When I grow up I'll turn the tables
Blood and blisters on my fingers
Chaos rules when we're apart
Watch my temper I go mental
I'll try to be gentle
When I grow up I'll be stable
When I grow up I'll turn the tables
When I grow up I'll turn the tables
Rip it up to shreds and let it go
Rip it up to shreds and let it go
Rip it up to shreds and let it go
Rip it up to shreds and let it go
Rip it up in shreds and let it go
When on foreign shores I am
Very truly yours I am
But if inclined to play I am
When in Spain for reasons I don't explain
I remain enjoying a brew
I do as the Romans do
If per chance I'm saying farewell to France
And romance drops in from the blue
My taking a brief detour with somebody new
It's just that when in Rome
I do as the Romans do
And though from Italy I lied to you prettily
Except now and then in Rome
I get that old yearn in Rome
And naturally when in Rome
I do as the romans do
Don't cable me snappily
To tell me we're through
In somebody's den in Rome
I do as the Romans do
So just disregard the signs and the omens
When in Rome I do as the Romans do
And there isn't a thing you can do
Second guess his changing ways
And fill your time with people just like you
And there isn't a thing you can say
You bite your tongue and wonder why
And then you watch your life flash by
Hoping things will turn around your way
How can I walk away and feel free
And there's no easy way to pretend
That anything could ever be
As good a thing as you and me
Its hard to understand this is the end
I could ever reach you
How can I walk away and feel free
And so although you'd like to stay a little while
You've gotta show a little style and exit smiling
And go on your own sweet way
You'll live to love another day
And though your sky tomorrow may not be as bright
Be glad you had a spot of light to spend awhile in
The tears that you're crying ain't easy to hide
In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and you think about the guy
And never ever think of counting sheep
When your lonely heart has learned it's lesson
You'd be his if only he would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss him most of all
So just walk away and don't turn your head
What more can you say now that hasn't been said
What's in this grab bag
But no one's to blame but myself
When you've lost your way
Staggering through the thin and thick of it
He tells her that a hurricane has destroyed their casino and he's lost all
Are you something more
Am I giving too little
How do you compare it to
It's a job offer. Eddie and Mrs. Brice fantasize as they help Fanny get
I lost a daughter but I gained a star.
But who used to stand there
They all forget they know ya
When it comes to credit.
The men who are older might prefer
When you see her on the stage
Who stands after every show
That's the way it goes.
I saw the heart you hide so well
I saw a quiet man who had a gentle way
A way that caught me in it's glowing spell
A love to last a life time through
And when I lost my heart so many years ago
I lost it lovingly and willingly to you
If I had to choose again
Will the shy and quiet girl he's going to see
That there's more of me than I may always show
Will he know that there's a world of love
With one more look at you
I could learn to tame the clouds
And let the sun shine through
Leave a troubled past and I might start anew
I'll solve the mysteries if you're the prize
Refresh these tired eyes
With one more look at you
I might overcome the anger
That I learned to know
Find a piece of mind I lost so long ago
Your gentle touch has made me strong again
For when you look at me
I'm everything and more that I had dreamed I'd be
My spirit feels a promise
We'll love and live more
Love and live forever
With one more look at you
I'd learn to change the stars
And change our fortunes too
I'd have the constellations paint your portrait too
The world could end each night
With one more look at you
With one more look at you
I want one more look at you
Your eyes are like fingers
I'm riding the passion arising inside me
I see the hunger arise in your eyes
And it's urging me on
Higher and harder and it's faster and farther
Your pleasure is part of the secret
Of flight that I found
When I feel like an eagle
My soul has no place on the ground
If you don't look away I'm secure
In the fact that you won't let me fall
I'm the master magician
Who'll help you escape
From the lies you've been told
When they're breaking your back
Bring the last straw to me
I break chains made of boredom that others have lived with for years
I leave good news on doorsteps
And laughs where there used to be tears
I'm gonna need you later
When you're not around
The world is made of music
Never ending symphonies of sound surround us
Miracles of melodies abound around us too
Infinite. So with your kind indulgence and my kind permission we
Would like to present a premiere performance of a new work concerto
For voice and appliances...
The world is a concerto
Each day begins with music
The world is a concerto
Oh hear the music bubbling everywhere
The whole wide world is whistling
The heavens hum along
All blending in a never ending song
The world is a concerto
A song in which each singer has a part
A rhapsody that's ringing through my heart
I feel the cleansing power
I tremble breathlessly
In keeping with the sweeping melody
Make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
You and the night and the music
You and the night and the music thrill me but will we be one
And take away the stars.
Let's come on and get together
Like the sky gets to the sea
Just taking some time on
Let's come on and make it better
Let's make everybody see
Just taking some time on
For those who feel inclined
Let's come on and get together
Let's come on and get together
Like the sky with the sea
Like the sky with the sea
Just taking some time on
Let's come on and tell the story
Of the way it used to be
Just taking some time on
Let's come on and sing a song now
Of the days when we were free
Just taking some time on
For those who feel inclined
Let's come on and get together
Let's come on and get together
Like the sky with the sea
Like the sky with the sea
Just taking some time on
Let's come on the feeling's right now
We want everyone to be
Just taking some time on
Let's come on and get together
Like the sky gets to the sea
Just taking some time on
For those who feel inclined
Let's come on and get together
Let's come on and get together
Like the sky with the sea
Like the sky with the sea
What a night this has been
I awoke in the light of a vision in white
The prettiest girl that I have ever seen
In corridors of air the clouds were waiting there
They knew that never again the skies would be so blue
They took away the sun and with it took the fun
So I look outside my window at the sheets of pouring rain
And I wonder if the sun will come again
But the sun will never shine the way it used to do
The clouds won't let it through
Oh the sun will never shine its smile for me and you
The clouds won't let it through
It wasn't long ago the people that I knew were glad
And nothing they ever thought about was sad
But since the sun has gone their laughing times are none
So they look outside their window at the sheets of pouring rain
And they wonder if the sun will come again
But the sun will never shine the way it used to do
The clouds won't let it through
Oh the sun will never shine its smile for me and you
When the world was woken
Save all unknowing eyes
And thoughts that once were spoken
And when the dawn is breaking
Look upward to the sky
If life is so hard to live
When the world has woken
And shadows leave the air
Then each spell will be broken
For everyone who cares
The day will then be endless
The night will soon pass by
If life is so hard to live
When the world has woken
For all who see the sun
And gentle words are spoken
The dawning has begun
Then man can live together
With one triumphant cry
If life is so hard to live
Put your hands in the air
Put your feet on the ground
Put your mind in a dream
You've got to keep it clean
Gonna steal the scene
Put your hands in the air
Put your feet on the ground
Put your mind in a dream
You've got to keep it clean
Gonna steal the scene
Put your hands in the air
Put your feet on the ground
Put your mind in a dream
You've got to keep it clean
She walks on through the night
Her circumstances slight
Are only helping her to fail
And though she feels she's right
She tries with all her might
And makes the deepest peril pale
She chooses who to love
And then unlike a dove
She takes the laughter from their smile
She wears a velvet glove
Her friends may find it rough
It is a gauntlet all the while
Don't ask me how I know
But this dark sky will soon be blue
Like so many drops of dew
Feel the ice melt to warm tears in my eyes
Do not ask me how I know
The effect of light on unseeing eyes
The sea of peace has left my shore
The silent spring will overflow
The sea of peace has met the sky
And like the Spring life whispers by
The winds of time have swept my shore
The trees that fall will rise no more
It's cold and the sun is white
The darkness before the light
Then you may be slipping
With words and with pen I write
Of things that are in my sight
It's cold and the moon is bright
The darkness before the light
Then you may be slipping
I am walking in a dream
Everything I touch it isn't real
People aren't just what they seem
And I really don't know what to feel
Mister Sunshine's not for me
I don't mind the sky of blue
Or the honey clouds that wander by
When that orange thing comes through
I must look away or think I'll die
Mister Sunshine's not for me
Blacker days I'll never see
And I curse your light a hundred times
When you shine your rays on me
I must hide my head or lose my mind
Mister Sunshine's not for me
My old man said I am mad
Said that things were saner in his day
All the words you said I threw away
Mister Sunshine's not for me
Yesterday seemed like I lived in a dream
All that I needed was there
There's no sense holding on
I know that I shouldn't care
Yesterday seemed like I lived in a dream
All that I needed was there
There's no sense holding on
I know that I shouldn't care
I can't seem to recall
Places that I've seen
It's like I've never been
Sometimes I feel so small
I can't seem to recall
Places that I've seen
It's like I've never been
The world outside my window slowly passes by
As I gaze on the dim glow of the evening sky
That wraps itself around me to hide me from the crowd
Then like a wall descending
Night will the day be ending
And it's if as though by magic
I turn and look behind me and all the crowd have gone
And though they're all around me I feel I am alone
The sounds of day have vanished and I find in their place
Then like a wall descending
Night will the day be ending
And it's if as though by magic
The world outside my window slowly passes by
As I gaze on the dim glow of the evening sky
That wraps itself around me to hide me from the crowd
Then like a wall descending
Night will the day be ending
And it's if as though by magic
When it's soaked through
Through leaves of green
In soft pools of blue
How white mist like love
How when it's soaked through
Must warm to the love of your heart
Warm to the love of your heart
Through leaves of green
Through leaves of green
Need you oh so bad by me
For the sake of pity be
The one whose open arms I see
You don't want me any more
Like a thorn that's in the sore
See you around with three or four
See the memories appear
They'll be gone within a year
It's the emptiness I fear
Now that you're not here
Now that you're not here
I remember people talking
People laughing and sharing their joys
How I long for small time town living
I remember Sunday fishing
Young girls laughing and sharing their joys
How I long for small time town living
How I long for small time town living
Don't ask me how I know
But this dark sky will soon be blue
Like so many drops of dew
Feel the ice melt to warm tears in my eyes
Do not ask me how I know
The effect of light on unseeing eyes
The sea of peace has left my shore
The silent spring will overflow
The sea of peace has met the sky
And like the Spring life whispers by
The winds of time have swept my shore
The trees that fall will rise no more
I can't go on without you
There's a part of me that's gone
Like a day without the sun
I can't go on without you
There is nothing I can do
And no words that I can say
All the meanings slip away
I can't go on without you
I used to think you loved me so
Now you have gone and love's no more
I can't go on without you
Though I must try to live again
But my tears fall like the rain
I can't go on without you
I can't go on without you
There's a part of me that's gone
Like a day without the sun
I can't go on without you
Like a day without the sun
I can't seem to recall
Places that I've seen
It's like I've never been
Sometimes I feel so small
I can't seem to recall
Places that I've seen
It's like I've never been
And with the dawn she changes
Her voice in different ranges
The torn and tattered pages
Say goodbye I couldn't try
Destroy her cards and letters
Act like I never met her
Until my heart is better
Say goodbye I couldn't try
And with the dawn she changes
Her voice in different ranges
The torn and tattered pages
The trees resound with open arms for one so rare
Brother Man just can't compare
When we're sitting on the banks of the sunshine
High above the living
He's so pleased to be
Buoyant and triumphant on the raging sea
Above the streets now empty to his mournful cry
Brother Man just heaves a sigh
When we're sitting on the banks of the sunshine
High above the living
We could live our lives together
And I will always love her
And I will always care
And I will always love her
Wasn't long before she grew tired of me
And the life she thought would redeem
All the love she'd thrown away as a child
All the things she thought she had seen
And I will always love her
And I will always care
And I will always love her
And I will always love her
And I will always care
Looking like something from out of space we came
He didn't mind us being here to live in peace and grace
What we're doing to him now could put us back in space
We're thinking like some creatures off the ocean floor
Losing sight of what we've really come here for
Take time to look around before it gets too late
It's a happy old world
That's what you make of it
But I'm sorry to be leaving it
It's a happy old world
That's what you make of it
It's a happy old world
We're tearing up the rivers and a thousand streams
We're building towers in the sky and racing for the sun
I need some help to get myself out of this maze
We can both just say goodbye and go our separate ways
That's what you make of it
But I'm sorry to be leaving it
It's a happy old world
That's what you make of it
Two of them watched in the dawn's early light
And two of them died in the morning
Search not your soul if you want to be right
But two of them died in the morning
It's not for you we cry
It is only for their sons
Forget the lives of others who are gone
Two and by two in the dawn's early light
All went to die in the morning
Search not your souls for the truth and the right
For all went to die in the morning light
It's not for you we cry
It is only for their sons
Forget the lives of others who are gone
It's not for you we cry
It is only for their sons
Forget the lives of others who are gone
Forget the lives of others who are gone
Forget the lives of others
Forget your wives and mothers
She comes up with the morning sun
And tells me life has just begun
Oh what it is to be young
And in the early evening light
She brings me flowers from the sun
Oh what it is to be young
And if you see her you will know
Falling softly on the snow
And in the early evening light
She brings me flowers for the night
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs in the trees
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs just for you and me
Time will see your tears run dry
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs in the trees
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs just for you and me
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs in the trees
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs just for you and me
Bless the tears of love now gone
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs in the trees
There's a mocking bird
Wish I could show you how to live your life
But I'm not sure which one of us is right
God only knows the tears I've cried
Wish I could show you how to live your life
But I'm not sure which one of us is right
And would I not be right
Wish I could show you how to live your life
But I'm not sure which one of us is right
If I had my way I would not be here
I've had my share of heartache and pain
For happiness I'm searching in vain
I've got to get rid of my ball and chain
I've had my share of heartache and pain
For happiness I'm searching in vain
I've got to get rid of my ball and chain
I've just got to be free
I've had my share of heartache and pain
For happiness I'm searching in vain
I've got to get rid of my ball and chain
I've had my share of heartache and pain
For happiness I'm searching in vain
She'll take your children by the hand
She'll lead them to the promised land
Holding hands and singing songs
In the smile on her face you just know she can't be wrong
She'll take your children by the hand
And lead them to the promised land
Holding hands and singing songs
In the smile on her face you just know she can't be wrong
She'll take your children by the hand
And lead them to the promised land
Holding hands and singing songs
In the smile on her face you just know she can't be wrong
Too much on your plate
If my fate had been left up to you
But my heart she was broken in two
Correcting all my bad mistakes
It's hard when life won't do
What you want it to do
Too much on your plate
Now you've taken your chains
And you wandered off into the blue
I'm still looking for somebody new
And evenings when I'm on my own
I sometimes think of you
It's hard when life won't do
Looking like something from out of space we came
He didn't mind us being here to live in peace and grace
What we're doing to him now could put us back in space
We're thinking like some creatures off the ocean floor
Losing sight of what we've really come here for
Take time to look around before it gets too late
It's a happy old world
That's what you make of it
But I'm sorry to be leaving it
It's a happy old world
That's what you make of it
It's a happy old world
We're tearing up the rivers and a thousand streams
We're building towers in the sky and racing for the sun
I need some help to get myself out of this maze
We can both just say goodbye and go our separate ways
That's what you make of it
But I'm sorry to be leaving it
It's a happy old world
That's what you make of it
Wish I could show you how to live your life
But I'm not sure which one of us is right
God only knows the tears I've cried
Wish I could show you how to live your life
But I'm not sure which one of us is right
And would I not be right
Wish I could show you how to live your life
But I'm not sure which one of us is right
If I had my way I would not be here
I've had my share of heartache and pain
For happiness I'm searching in vain
I've got to get rid of my ball and chain
I've had my share of heartache and pain
For happiness I'm searching in vain
I've got to get rid of my ball and chain
I've just got to be free
I've had my share of heartache and pain
For happiness I'm searching in vain
I've got to get rid of my ball and chain
I've had my share of heartache and pain
For happiness I'm searching in vain
Didn't anybody see his hand move faster
Than the lightning in his eyes
And didn't anybody want to ask the calliope
The flying horses crooned but did not know
The Medicine Man sits on the stage
The silver blade burns bright
And tells us to beware
Of mirrored passages that throw a thousand images
The wheel spins slower as it calls us back to play
Round and round now we go
Shout your name to the wind
As it spins by your side
I've been looking for a place that I know well
It's a long long way from here and when I get there
I've been looking for a time that I once knew
I could spend some happy hours just being there with you
It doesn't matter where you go
As long as there is someone there you know
So if you need a friend you can depend on me
And in the darkest night you need a light to see
Your shadow's sinking low
Feels like a broken bone
Guess I'll go on home
I've been looking for someone I know so well
She's a long long way from me and when I find her
It doesn't matter where she goes
There's a little bit of you and some of me
There's a little bit of everything you see
But you don't know why Harry cried
There's a time right after love when you feel low
Like a bird with perfect wings denied the sky
But you don't know why Harry cried
Take a look at the common man
He can talk with the use of his hands
Pass you on by with a smile
Like he just don't care
Take a look at yourself in the light
People see by the look in your eyes
Either you're deaf or you're blind
Or you just don't care Well something stirred today
Young Harry he passed away
Someone moves and a leaf falls to the ground
Morning comes and he is not around
But you don't know why Harry cried
Well you pick him up and you put him in your hand
And he slips on through like tiny bits of sand
But you don't know why Harry cried
Take a look at the common man
He can talk with the use of his hands
Pass you on by with a smile
Like he just don't care
Take a look at yourself in the light
People see by the look in your eyes
Either you're deaf or you're blind
Or you just don't care Well something stirred today
Young Harry he passed away
I once loved a lady who did change into a child
I saw the light of day shine in her eyes
I loved her like a baby and I raised her to the sky
It seems the light of day did pass me by
Now she walks along the seashore
And she listens to the sea
But I can't say if she ever thinks of me
If I were of the ocean
Or a wave upon the sand
Or just a drop of water in her hand
A pebble or a broken shell
A rock upon the shore
I doubt if I could love her any more
Now she walks along the seashore
And she listens to the sea
A life and some time I just gotta spend
There's gold in the mountains
Passing time in the sun
You wonder why she left so soon
No word or reason why
All feelings born can only die
With memories you just can't hide
The song flows on you can't pursue
Your words don't mean a thing
The mood's too hard for you to sing
Moving on with a sigh
A silhouette against the sky
The seconds they dripped right on by
And slowly filled the day
Mystery is following me down that lonesome road
There's someone on my shoulder and he will not share a load
There's a certain something deep inside
Like a rolling sea or a river wide
As the orchestra starts playing
When the orchestra starts playing
While the folks around me sing on
There's a place down home where people meet
They clap their hands and they stamp their feet
When the music starts and the band plays
They sing out loud and they sing out clear
Turn your head round girl and you might just hear
And if you do then start down singing
While the folks around me sing on
Take back all of your dough
You've got no place to go
My sweetest girl that I ever had
She's drive any poor man bad
Well my lady and me we're gonna dance all night
Yeah yeah we're gonna dance until the broad broad light
The sweetest girl that I ever had
Was guaranteed to drive a poor man bad
Here I sit watching the day out
All of the words that I could chose to say
I need a friend to walk with me
And sit in the shade of an old tree
Watching the people pass by now
They just don't know why or know how
They don't seem to care about all that I've seen
They just walk on by never knowing I've been
Sitting up here where I'm wind blown
Only to ask and to be shown
Things that would make you believe what I say
The eyes of night march slowly by
The kneeling man just sighs
Protected by the one great wall
He probes his clouded mind
If he takes a look around him
Is there nothing left to see
Is there nothing left at all
With trembling hands he wipes his eyes
But does not feel the need
The morning sun shines on
Left standing through it all
If he takes a look around him
Is there nothing left to see
Is there nothing left at all
If he takes a look around him
Is there nothing left to see
Is there nothing left at all
When I was just a child
My world it was so small
The empty playground swings
And as the years passed by
I never thought to try
The childhood fantasies
Well the moon is bright and this weather's fine
And there's something I've got to say
That the blackest day's when the nations fight
Remember to pray when you go to bed
For a brave new world
My small world's closed the door
I feel like I should cry
Death's desperation lies on every eye
In the brave new world
Well the moon is bright and the weather's fine
And there's something I've got to say
Well my mama told me and I know she's right
That the blackest day's when the nations fight
Remember to pray when you go to bed
For a brave new world
And life has passed my way
My tears have all run dry
I've seen men born to kill and born to die
For a brave new world
For a brave new world
We could live our lives together
And I will always love her
And I will always care
And I will always love her
Wasn't long before she grew tired of me
And the life she thought would redeem
All the love she'd thrown away as a child
All the things she thought she had seen
And I will always love her
And I will always care
And I will always love her
And I will always love her
And I will always care
She comes up with the morning sun
And tells me life has just begun
Oh what it is to be young
And in the early evening light
She brings me flowers from the sun
Oh what it is to be young
And if you see her you will know
Falling softly on the snow
And in the early evening light
She brings me flowers for the night
I once loved a lady who did change into a child
I saw the light of day shine in her eyes
I loved her like a baby and I raised her to the sky
It seems the light of day did pass me by
Now she walks along the seashore
And she listens to the sea
But I can't say if she ever thinks of me
If I were of the ocean

Didn't anybody see his hand move faster
Than the lightning in his eyes
And didn't anybody want to ask the calliope
The flying horses crooned but did not know
The Medicine Man sits on the stage
The silver blade burns bright
And tells us to beware
Of mirrored passages that throw a thousand images
The wheel spins slower as it calls us back to play
Round and round now we go
Shout your name to the wind
As it spins by your side
And there's something I've got to say
Yes it's making me feel this way
I see your face in everything I do
And there's something I've got to say
Yes it's making me feel this way
We've got a story to strike you down
About a girl with the light in her eyes
Let the wheels run dry
By the light of the moon flashing by
Let the wheels run dry
Fly on by silver bird in the sky
Bring on the sunshine shine in her eyes
Fly on by silver bird
For a sight of the light in her eyes
Let the wheels run dry
Fly on by silver bird in the sky
Bring on the sunshine shine in her eyes
I feel sorry for the soldier who is shot and stoned in anger
I feel sorry for his wife and child at home
For the people that he's maimed and left alone
I feel sorry for the children who with open mind are willing
To fight for ideals aged and past their time
I feel sorry for the children who will join the vicious circle
With a knife and a gun in each hand
It's time to stop and decide
Politicians point views
But they're pointing for you
The solution has to be seen
To protect myself from defeat
And from war I'll make no retreat
His golden sword lay in its sheath beneath his silver shroud
Though your deeds like spears strike my soul
I thank Dixie and Pete too
I thank Teddy for a sweet scene
I thank Ollie and Chris too
I thank Janet for the meat pies
I thank Heather for the waterfall
And Georgie for his Yankee drawl
And Cassie is a gas with his
I thank Nicky for the record machine
I thank Ricky for the discount between
For the sun is in my eyes
Everything you say just passes by
What I'd give for just a smile
Instead of drifting at
A hundred thousand miles
All my lines have gone dead
And I'm not very sure
I can't make it alone
For the sun is in my eyes
Everything you say just passes by
Here I stay until I'm found
Insane in space and my world
All my lines have gone dead
And I'm not very sure
The moon is making patterns on the water
Why it is I just can't say
I'm not old enough or wise enough to wonder
I don't think about the magic that I'm under
You'll find me in the twilight on the mountain
When the sun shines on the lake
I'm a child of darkness lost among the thunder
Where the shafts of moonlight break the sky asunder
Child of God was born today
The child of woman just slipped away
The child of man knelt down to pray
And the children of the earth
Didn't know it was the day of
One thousand years or maybe more
Since they first set eyes on that foreign shore
The grass was green and the water pure
They turned the key and opened the door
Child of God says love your brother
Child of God says love your sister
All believers gather round
Press your faces to the ground
Lift your voices to the sound
Of all the others who have found
Child of God says love your brother
Child of God says love your sister
Won't ever change now I'm over you
Won't ever change now I'm over you
Won't ever change now I'm over you
Won't ever change now I'm over you
The morning light hurts my eyes
The evening skies make me cry
I'd be no place at all
I'd be lost without you
Won't ever change now I'm over you
Won't ever change now I'm over you
Confusing all I've done before I've begun
Becomes a roaring stream
A nightmare and a dream rolled into one
But when the city sleeps
I'm up and on my feet
Along the darkened streets
Through the empty town
My shadows seem to play
But when the city sleeps
I'm up and on my feet
Along the darkened streets
I thank Dixie and Pete too
I thank Teddy for a sweet scene
I thank Ollie and Chris too
I thank Janet for the meat pies
I thank Heather for the waterfall
And Georgie for his Yankee drawl
And Cassie is a gas with his
I thank Nicky for the record machine
I thank Ricky for the discount between
Didn't anybody see his hand move faster
Than the lightning in his eyes
And didn't anybody want to ask the calliope
The flying horses crooned but did not know

The silver blade burns bright
And tells us to beware
Of mirrored passages that throw a thousand images
The wheel spins slower as it calls us back to play
Round and round now we go
Shout your name to the wind
As it spins by your side
I can tell by the way you walk
I can tell by the way you talk
I can tell by the way you smile
I can tell by the way you sing
I can tell by the way you swing
I can tell by the way you move
I can see by the way you move
I can see by the way you groove
I can see by the way you smile
I think I'm going back from where I came
There's something that I feel but can't explain
People running round and round
Putting one another down
The joker laughs the joker cries
He sees the world through weary eyes
People running round and round
Putting one another down
It's not too late to see we're all the same
The joker sees a better way
Child of God was born today
The child of woman just slipped away
The child of man knelt down to pray
And the children of the earth
Didn't know it was the day of
One thousand years or maybe more
Since they first set eyes on that foreign shore

You'll find me in the twilight on the mountain
When the sun shines on the lake
I'm a child of darkness lost among the thunder
Where the shafts of moonlight break the sky asunder
I'm a child of South Africa
I'm a child of Vietnam
I'm a child of Northern Ireland
I'm a small boy with blood on his hands
Yes I'm a child of the universe
Yes I'm a child of the universe
You can see me on the TV every night
Always there to join in someone else's fight
That cannot reason why
Yes I'm a child of the universe
Yes I'm a child of the universe
You can see me on the TV every day
That my life up here was slowly drifting by
And all I've got to do is sit and cry
The Earth is so clear and it's simply a reach away
I just had to laugh today but the news it seemed to say
That my life once full was surely running dry
I prayed a while but then I had to cry
That man is surely just a man
The road is far too long
And life too short to carry on
And all I've got to do is sit and cry
That man is surely just a man
The road is far too long
His crazy frame against the dawn
His hungry leap and ragged fall
A suicidal perch is now laid bare
To searching eyes and empty stares
A fearful silence hits the crowd
The air hangs heavy with the sound
Of useless wings against the morning sky
As paper yields before their eyes
A broken man without a dream
Heard a song the other day
About a major out in space
Heard the news the other day
About a sailor oh so gay
They took me far away
Of being taken in again
All you have to do is smile to cause a landslide
Heard a song just yesterday
About a man who sold the world away
Of being taken in again
All you have to do is smile to cause a landslide
Running alone in the crazy city
Look at the face of once were pretty
People then wonder what happened
Climb on the back of a silver bird
Know that you're living in today
No need to hide yourself away
Out in the country's where I'm going
Back where the tree of life's still growing
Take a free ride where the tide
Flows the way of your heart
Follow the wild dove where he's flying
Out where the sun is never crying
Wait at the gate or they'll stop you
Know that you're living in today
I can't see your face
I can't hear your name
So light your light shining and star bright
It's easy to see a poor boy's blues
When he's working every day
It's harder to be there in his shoes
He was born to be that way
If I tell you tomorrow I'm leaving
A poor boy works hard for his living
But a rich man he plays to pass the time
We had some laughs along the way
But I have to be leaving
And there's nothing you can do to make me stay
If I tell you tomorrow I'm leaving
A poor boy works hard for his living
But a rich man he plays to pass the time
We had some laughs along the way
But I have to be leaving
Number 12 bus shuffling down Shaw Road way
It's easy to see a poor boy's blues
When he's working every day
It's harder to be there in his shoes
Please lay down your pistols and your rifles
Please lay down your thoughts of being no one
Concentrate on what you ought to be
Then lay down your bullshit and your protests
Then lay down your governments of greed
Take a look at what lies all around you
Then pray God we can live in peace
Everyone's a loner till he needs a helping hand
Everyone is everybody else
Everyone's a no one till he wants to make a stand
God alone knows how we will survive
So please lay down your pistols and your rifles
Please lay down your thoughts of being no one
Concentrate on what you ought to be
Everyone's a loner till he needs a helping hand
Everyone is everybody else
Everyone's a no one till he wants to make a stand
I'm a child of South Africa
I'm a child of Vietnam
I'm a child of Northern Ireland
I'm a small boy with blood on his hands
Yes I'm a child of the universe
Yes I'm a child of the universe

About a man who sold the world away
Of being taken in again
All you have to do is smile to cause a landslide
It's so strange that I should meet you
Here upon the highest point of earth
It's safe to say we've proved our worth
And the flags that we both hold
Are altogether vain and meaningless.
It's time we threw away.
We should fall upon our knees
And thank sweet God we are alive.
Sweet God we are alive.
All across the face of earth
The clouds are gathering to hide the ways of man.
There is no earthly plan
And the air is pure enough
To wipe away all doubts of innocence.
For now and evermore.
We should fall upon our knees
And thank sweet God we are alive.
Sweet God we are alive.

Yes I'm a child of the universe
You can see me on the TV every day
In my life I have seen so many things
Some were true and some were not what they seemed
In my life I've seen love and I've seen loss
I have been to a place where chaos rules
In the caves of the talking stoned the fools
Seen the stars plant their seeds and watch them grow
Just to keep mister reap but never sow
In my life I've seen greed and I've seen hate
Seen the first to accuse the last to praise
Tried so hard to find just one saving grace
But I was young did not know
Mister middle of the road
Where's the lady and the time I used to know
I think that I've been on the road too long
Scenes of better days are pictured in my head
And haunting me those old familiar songs
Oh sweet Jesus hear me cry
Let me see a clearing sky
For tomorrow I may be back home again
So take the shadow from my eyes
Sunday morning comes I'm feeling kind of down
I can't see back to where it all began
And I know you'd help me if you only could
I don't know why or where or who I am
Oh sweet Jesus hear me cry
Let me see a clearing sky
For tomorrow I may be back home again
So take the shadow from my eyes
The long and winding road that leads to your door
Here comes the sun it's all right people shout for more
But were you trying to deceive telling me
All you need is love to succeed
I got a feeling for you blue and I feel fine
I tried so hard to make believe that I'd see
All you need is love to succeed
Lady Madonna let it be
Something in the way you moved me yesterday
Sound of seagulls crying fills the air
High above the lonely one is there
Like the passing wind
Find him miles away in endless flight
The answer must be heard
And from a lonely bird
He's giving us a reason to believe
See the painted silver sunlight on his wing
As he sails upon the wind and slowly skyward
Flying as to music you can hear him sing
The answer must be heard
And from a lonely bird
We will survive beyond the grave
And as we sleep we will be saved
Life in its essence will endure
Whilst still on earth we can be sure
We will survive beyond the grave
And as we sleep we will be saved
Though storm and tempest ravage all
And all is darkness where we fall
Like brave Explorers bold and free
Above the seven seas is one
The sea of life we drift upon
Our spirits living in the waves
As the sounds of the morning
Roll on out of the night
The thoughts of a dreamer
Asking and telling me why
Lady awaken the morning is taking
Your bad dreams away from your eyes
So come now it's time to arise
As the sounds of the morning
Rise up out of the blue
Still a voice keeps on saying
Lady awaken the morning is taking
Your bad dreams away from your eyes
So come now it's time to arise
You made me smile when I was down
So I'm always gonna sing for you
You made me smile when I was down
Their spirits soar on high
They wing with birds that float on by
Their spirits with the breeze
That gently plays the summer leaves
Life is a bird in the sky
Life is the breeze blowing by
Time picked the words
Time picked the songs
But we sang them wrong
Their spirits with the rain
That feeds the wheat and weeds the same
The sun their spirits light
That feels and warms both black and white
Life is the rain from on high
Life is the sun in the sky
Time picked the words
Time picked the songs
But we sang them wrong
Their spirits bless the cruel
Their spirits point the way
Life is a soft lullaby
Soothing a child as it cries
And when I'm waiting for the sun to smile upon my face
And when I'm waiting for the sun to shine so I can see
Takes me to the places where I long to be
You took all my money
One ride after midnight
Everybody needs someone to love
Everybody needs a friend
Everybody needs someone to care
I thought it was easy
Of old men and first blood
The dice are all loaded
But you pay the loser
Seems the rain is turning into snow
Everybody needs someone to love
Everybody needs a friend
Everybody needs someone to care
We stand round your doorways
You hang on the walls
Your frames are your windows
Put your bodies on the stalls
You take all our money
We're dealt just the one card
But the dealer plays in every game
Everybody needs someone to love
Everybody needs a friend
Everybody needs someone to care
See the gambler make a stand
Holds a lifetime in his hand
Win the game or lose control
But the world goes on forever
Shadows played upon the wall
You pay the piper to call the tune
And the song goes on forever
And when all the words have gone
There's the thought to carry on
Just like a bird that sings
Leave it all behind and spread your wings
Saw the road move on before me
Times when I was tired and lost my way
Looking at life and strangely for the first time
Thinking that I could stay here
But the world moves on forever
And when all the words have gone
There's the thought to carry on
Just like a bird that sings
Leave it all behind and spread your wings
The rock on which I stand is slowly sinking in the sand
The sheer realities of life are rushing by
I am looking out at life and I don't know what's wrong or right
And I can't even see the bright side of the moon
I stopped a man in the street today
I asked again but he walked away
Time and time again I've tried to recreate the past few days
Evaluate the constants from the haze
Night is light and dark is day
If I disagree they say I'm insane
And the treatment will begin
If I say that the day is light
They put me out in the pouring rain
To enjoy the sun or to feel the pain
Of the nightmare life's become
I asked a man in the street today
The sheer realities are here to stay
I'm looking out at life and now I know what's wrong and right
It's what you hear and what you read and what they say
I saw a man in the street today
I've got something you've not seen
Now I know it's not a dream
Burning fiery furnace in the sky
Burns the ground around us where we lie
Bring your cloud and shadows to our eyes
Dry our seas and rivers with your light
Universal sentinel you are
Guide of all who look on from afar
God of old now broken and defaced
Punish all who've fallen from your grace
No river too wide on the way
Gonna make it on your own
Write a song that everyone can sing along
So you want to take a trip to the stars
You're losing your dreams on the way
Gonna make it on your own
Write a song that everyone can sing along
So you want to take a trip to the stars
All the bad times that you've had
Gonna make it on your own
Write a song that everyone can sing along
So you want to take a trip to the stars
I was down on the east side
On a block with no name
When I walked in a movie
Tell me when you came together
Didn't know when I entered
It was then that I saw you
But your mouth stole the show
Tell me when you came together
Got your form on the line
I don't know who you're under
But I know it ain't mine
Tell me when you came together
And you don't know where you are
If you need someone to be there
When the dark night is upon you
And you're feeling very small
If you need someone around you
Show me the need in me
Tell me that you can see
Whenever you're falling
It's the same old play
It's the same old play
And you don't know who you are
If you need someone to be there
I got up with a feeling of an emptiness inside
To the noise of the sidewalk and the silence of my mind
Took the club elevator to the floor with a view
No river too wide on the way
Gonna make it on your own
Write a song that everyone can sing along
So you want to take a trip to the stars
You're losing your dreams on the way
Gonna make it on your own
Write a song that everyone can sing along
So you want to take a trip to the stars
All the bad times that you've had
Gonna make it on your own
Write a song that everyone can sing along
So you want to take a trip to the stars
I was down on the east side
On a block with no name
When I walked in a movie
Tell me when you came together
Didn't know when I entered
It was then that I saw you
But your mouth stole the show
Tell me when you came together
Got your form on the line
I don't know who you're under
But I know it ain't mine
Tell me when you came together
Burning fiery furnace in the sky
Burns the ground around us where we lie
Bring your cloud and shadows to our eyes
Dry our seas and rivers with your light
Universal sentinel you are
Guide of all who look on from afar
God of old now broken and defaced
Punish all who've fallen from your grace
No river too wide on the way
Gonna make it on your own
Write a song that everyone can sing along
So you want to take a trip to the stars
You're losing your dreams on the way
Gonna make it on your own
Write a song that everyone can sing along
So you want to take a trip to the stars
All the bad times that you've had
Gonna make it on your own
Write a song that everyone can sing along
So you want to take a trip to the stars
I got up with a feeling of an emptiness inside
To the noise of the sidewalk and the silence of my mind
Took the club elevator to the floor with a view
Valley's deep and the mountain's so high
If you want to see God you've got to move on the other side
You stand up there with your head in the clouds
Don't try to fly you know you might not come down
Jesus came down from Heaven to earth
The people said it was a virgin birth
Jesus came down from Heaven to earth
The people said it was a virgin birth
The people said it was a virgin birth
He told great stories of the Lord
He told great stories of the Lord
He rose again as if to ask us why
Then he ascended into the sky
As if to say in God alone you soar
As if to say in God alone we fly
Valley's deep and the mountain's so high
If you want to see God you've got to move on the other side
You stand up there with your head in the clouds
Don't try to fly you know you might not come down
Love was like a violin playing soft and low
In every day in every hour our love was everything
In every day in every hour our love was everything
You were like the autumn leaves blowing from my tree
In every day in every hour our love was everything
When the lights are fading slowly on another show
Goodbye bright light city heading for the sun
Where the southern girls are pretty and there's two for one
All the nights that I've missed you
All the nights without end
All the times that I've called you
Only needing a friend
Now your eyes shine with beauty
That I missed long ago
Guess the truth is I love you
As I look from my window
To the streets where you stand
I am gazing through dark glass
We can't walk hand in hand
Though your friends try to tell me
Though your friends you defend
They keep my heart from your heart
We must be in the end
All the nights that I've missed you
All the nights without end
All the times that I've called you
Only needing a friend
Now your eyes shine with beauty
That I missed long ago
Guess the truth is I love you
She's a hard hearted woman
See the way that she's watching you
Victims falling before her
And there's nothing that you can do
See the hard hearted woman
Watch the way that she's dancing now
Eyes are flashing before you
See the way that she's watching now
We steered our ship to the Sea of all Tranquility
That the songs we sing and the words we bring
We set our sights on the Sea of all Tranquility
Our pointless flight betraying now fallen we are
And the final reach to that barren beach
Yesterday our songs of glory shone
A dream of ages every one
We sold our souls for senseless gain
And brought our harvest home in vain
Yesterday our songs of glory shone
A dream of ages every one
We sold our souls for senseless gain
There's a spirit floating on the water
There's a shadow lying down by the shore
A sacrifice for the coat he's wearing
We carry the burden upon our shoulder
We carry their lives in the palm of our hand
Don't you care about the state you're in
See the spirit floating on the water
See the shadow lying down by the shore
We carry the burden upon our shoulder
We carry their lives in the palm of our hand
Don't you care about the state you're in
Well I feel like I've come to the end of a long long road
My body's tired and my mind's got no place to go
Well I feel like I've come to the end of a long long day
The victim of a life that I tried to give away
A prisoner of the isles where there's nothing left to be
Well I feel like I've come to the end of a long long road
My body's tired and my mind's got no place to go
But you know I've found
Thought I was a loser
But you proved me wrong
You're taking me so much higher
You're taking me so much higher
You're taking me so much higher
You're taking me so much higher
Give me just five minutes of your time
That's all it takes to say I love you so.
Of our love and how I lost control.
You'll know why I lied.
That's all it takes to say I need you so.
Just the two of us at your place on our own.
You'll know why I lied.
They told me this morning
That you won the race
The kid took first place
They said you got a lady
Well that's just right
You're calling her Ruthy
What life is all about
All the things that see you through
Pearls of wisdom from Frederick The Great
They tell me she's pretty
Well that's no surprise
Just give her a guitar
And start her off right
They say she's a longhair
I hope Frank don't mind
And Peter's got a sweat on
Till she's sealed and signed
What life is all about
All the things that see you through
Valley's deep and the mountain's so high
If you want to see God you've got to move on the other side
You stand up there with your head in the clouds
Don't try to fly you know you might not come down
Jesus came down from Heaven to earth
The people said it was a virgin birth
Jesus came down from Heaven to earth
The people said it was a virgin birth
The people said it was a virgin birth
He told great stories of the Lord
He told great stories of the Lord
He rose again as if to ask us why
Then he ascended into the sky
As if to say in God alone you soar
As if to say in God alone we fly
Valley's deep and the mountain's so high
If you want to see God you've got to move on the other side
You stand up there with your head in the clouds
Don't try to fly you know you might not come down
When the lights are fading slowly on another show
Goodbye bright light city heading for the sun
Where the southern girls are pretty and there's two for one
Didn't anybody see his hand move faster
Than the lightning in his eyes
And didn't anybody want to ask the calliope
The flying horses crooned but did not know
The Medicine Man sits on the stage
The silver blade burns bright
And tells us to beware
Of mirrored passages that throw a thousand images
The wheel spins slower as it calls us back to play
Round and round now we go
Shout your name to the wind
As it spins by your side
Even the bad times are good when you're around
Even the hard times are easy to face
There ain't nothing that you cannot do
As I shoot all my love into you
You know that's the best way to feel it
Just get a hold and watch how it grows
Even the bad times are good when you're around
Even the hard times are easy to face
You tear up my soul and then fill up the whole
Then you grab for my heart and just tear it apart
As I shoot all my love in your fire
You know that's the best way to feel it
Looking back into the night
Falling down on the city lights far away
Years may come and years they go
You've seen your bridges burning
And the wheels of time keep turning
Like a ship in the night
You passed along the highways of my life
And now my mind you're always in
As she sails across the skyway of Berlin
Thought I heard your bells cry
Bringing the life to your face
The time for tears has passed away
Can't you see the night is lifting
And the sands of time are shifting
Like a ship in the night
You passed along the highways of my life
And now my mind you're always in
As she sails across the skyway of Berlin
Like a ship in the night
You passed along the highways of my life
And now my mind you're always in
I'm hitting the road to heading nowhere
I'm stuck inside my generation
I'm sick of the sound of Rolling Thunder
David Bowie was Hunky Dory
Give me the sound of Arthur Lee with
I'm cutting out now before the New Wave
Takes my surf board flair
Remember the time when Zappa said
And Tommy's the king of the pinball flings
That chased my generation
David Bowie was Hunky Dory
Give me the sound of Arthur Lee with
How come you happened to be hanging around
I thought I always had my feet on the ground
I've got the feeling that it won't be for long
The way you're dancing ain't good for my soul
The situation's getting out of control
How come you happened to be hanging around
I thought I always had my feet on the ground
I've got the feeling that I'm spinning and spinning
Born a poor worker's son
Taught to fight for all his rights
Union might is the leading light
It's a shame and it's a sin
They don't know the mood they're in
Until they strike for what is right
It's a shame and it's a sin
They don't know the mood they're in
Until they strike for what is right
Don't give us your reasons
Our reason has gone out the door
Born a poor worker's son
Taught to fight for all his rights
Union might is the leading light
It's a shame and it's a sin
They don't know the mood they're in
Until they strike for what is right
My only friend is my old boat
With an empty sea and an open sky
A void no man can justify
Your sacrifices will ensure
A port of refuge ever more
We'll wait till England's found
I was torn between what was good and right
And those who told me when to fight
So they left me here and they sailed away
Your sacrifices will ensure
A port of refuge ever more
We'll wait till England's found
On the road and I'm feeling low
Got a ticket for my way back home
I start to feel like a rolling stone
Down in the bar talking to the trees
I found a lady hanging on my sleeve
Take a sip of my wine
It's gonna make you feel fine
I didn't see a warning sign
Take a sip of my wine
It's gonna make you feel fine
Shining out like beacons burning
They can stop this endless night
They can stop the wheels from turning
Faces in a setting sun
Say again that we soon will be one
Starlight rakes the silver wing
Bringing home its sons and daughters
Spinning swift above the waters
Faces in a setting sun
Deep range star lords
Rebel land of black night
Mistress of fear see me towards always
Nova bright shine far beyond all time
Beings of the fourth kind
Ring worlds timeless in ice
Mistress of fear see me towards always
Secret mood of corridors in hyperspace
Nova bright shine far beyond the barriers of night
Take me through the laser beams
The moving sands of Mars to see
Deep range star lords
Rebel land of black night
I give up everything I have
Even give this heart of mine
I would give up my soul
Giving it all for you
Give up everything I have
I would give up my soul
On a cold misty night
She stood with a Colt 45
A victim to take by surprise
She's the Golden Gate Park killer
Where she got herself beat up and left for dead
By a man she felt true love for
But who left her out of hand
Now she's out to take revenge on every man
As she stands there with a pistol in her hand
She looks in his eyes
He goes for the gun in her hand
And got it right between the eyes
She's the Golden Gate Park killer
Where she got herself beat up and left for dead
By a man she felt true love for
But who left her out of hand
Now she's out to take revenge on every man
Looking back into the night
Falling down on the city lights far away
Years may come and years they go
You've seen your bridges burning
And the wheels of time keep turning
Like a ship in the night
You passed along the highways of my life

Can't you see the night is lifting

Like a ship in the night
You passed along the highways of my life
And now my mind you're always in
Even the bad times are good when you're around
Even the hard times are easy to face
There ain't nothing that you cannot do

Love like a burning fire
Watch as the flame grows higher
Got to keep on running faster than time
And you're riding high above
Out where the light is burning
There's a heart that's true
Sounds of the night returning
Got to keep on running faster than time
And you're riding high above
Get Down Boogie Alright
Get Down Boogie Alright
Don't Give Me That Jive
The day begins riding a rainbow
Bow in her hand to drive away
The night again nothing has changed
And all around people are waking
King of them all has gone to rest
He passed the test leaving the stage
And into their ears the song they'd love to sing forever
Lighting the scene another world
The flags unfurled into the sky
And in the air music is playing
Ingots of gold fall to the ground
Creating sound into the night
The song they'd love to sing forever
She's a country girl at heart
She's a country girl at heart
Every day I'm waiting by the telephone
Every day you keep me hanging on
About where you're gone and how for long
Before our love turns to stone
See you in the papers and the magazines
But a photograph's no good to me
About where you're gone and how for long
Before our love turns to stone
Saw you for the first time and my shutter froze
About where you're gone and how for long
Before our love turns to stone
Beauty contests were your only claim to fame
Then your body won over your brain
You stripped for the lights
And things went just right
Now you're suntanned right down to the bone
See the light of the universe
Not a clown in disguise
The power within me lights the way
Of a thousand stars shine bright
Don't burn your hands
You can't touch what's deep within
Reaching my final goal
In the light of the night
Trying hard to forget
All the cries and the lies
Of the people she met
Hypnotized by the sight
That you're seeing and yet
Can't disguise in her eyes
There's a look of regret
So she drifts into tomorrow
Maybe she can find a better way
To love and see her sorrow
Like the sand that is washed on the shore
Don't believe all the tears and the crying
She's running back for more
In the bars where the stars
Drink tequila and wine
And the feeling is fine
See her face every place
Every movement in time
But don't choose or a loser you'll be
When she throws you her line
And she drifts into tomorrow
Maybe she can find a better way
To love and see her sorrow
Like the sand that is washed on the shore
Don't believe all the tears and the crying
In a tower of strength
Scaring death to the strains of their crying
Of escapists who sail
With assassins who kill for the morning
Don't paint the sunlight
Don't paint the sunlight
Scaring death to the strains of their crying
Of escapists who sail
With assassins who kill for the morning
Don't paint the sunlight
You can make the day seem right
And make the darkness bright
You'll want it back some day
We're gonna make it right
And play to the world tonight
We'll play to the world
Life is like a passing dream
It's never what it seems to be
We're gonna make it right
And play to the world tonight
Going down with a troubled mind
You leave me waiting on the border line
I'm thinking it's a waste of time
You say that you're good for me
Was a time when I'd let it be
But now there's no reality
Get back to your own side of the highway
You're straying across the line
I know you're a heart breaking lover
Isn't any other time to take a ride
Get back in the long grass
Get back to the street
Good loving is hard to find
You keep playing the same old rhyme
Got the feeling that you're gonna be
You play in another key
Go tell your friends that I set you free
I know the way it used to be
Watching you hitch a ride
Get back to your own side of the highway
You're straying across the line
I know you're a heart breaking lover
Isn't any other time to take a ride
Get back in the long grass
Get back to the street
We've got a reason to go on
Seems like I've waited for a lifetime
But honey I believed in you
When I saw her face I had to cry
Seems like I've waited for a lifetime
But honey I believed in you
To make my dreams all come true
I tried and tried to talk it over
Seemed like we'd waited a million years
Then you conceived our child was born
Picked her up put her by your side
Saw a smile that you couldn't hide
I tried and tried to talk it over
Then you conceived our child was born
Picked her up put her by your side
Saw a smile that you couldn't hide
We've got a reason to go on
Seems like I've waited for a lifetime
But honey I believed in you
To make my dreams all come true
Stranger at the gate let him in
Stranger at the gate let him in
Stranger at the gate let him in
He's been waiting on the other side
He's been waiting on the other side
He's been waiting for the turn of the tide
Promises leave you with nothing to show
Destiny leaves you with nowhere to go
Can you pay the price
Then your life is waiting
We can help you no more
Standing with our back to the wall
Then your life is waiting
Promises leave you with nothing to show
Destiny leaves you with nowhere to go
Can you pay the price
Then your life is waiting
We can help you no more
Cause you ain't the way that I feel
And it ain't looking at you
I believe in myself and nobody else
Your kind of love ain't for real
But suddenly you ain't so cool
Great God above it's diamond love
But that kind of rock don't appeal
And it ain't looking at you
I believe in myself and nobody else
Your kind of love ain't for real
I got to change it's feeling strange
And strange is a highway for fools
If it's diamond love that makes you feel good
Then that kind of love I can steal
And it ain't looking at you
I believe in myself and nobody else
Here lie the towers so tall
Time softly playing the chord
Could be lost in the void
Gone like the dreams that you made
Drawn by the mystical sight
There's a voice in the night
And your eyes see it all
And sail on through the night
Drift through tomorrow's
Dreams that you follow
Fools are entranced by the dawn
But the wise man misses it all
He laughs and the pages are torn
While the intellect scorns
As he clutches the straws
And sail on through the night
Drift through tomorrow's
Dreams that you follow
I look down the street but there's no one there
I call out for life but my heart feels despair
There's no sign of a light in the cold dismal night
The lights have all gone the clothes are all torn
The people are gone but the victory's won
I call out for life but it's after the day
Now the people are gone just the city alone
Eyes look from the second floor
Down to the street below
Calm now the wind is slow
See posters once on the wall
Now washed away in the rain
Peeling from buildings tall
I'll follow you friends to where life never ends
Make our mistakes again as our life lines descend
Time is like dust and the dust is like snow
As it covers the ruins of the life that you know
Trees once green now turned to stone
Objects that look like ghosts
All of them overgrown
Mist all sight and mind is blurred
Lie on your back and cry
Words uttered never heard
I look down the street but there's no one there
I call out for life but my heart feels despair
There's no sign of a light in the cold dismal night
The lights have all gone the clothes are torn
The people are gone but the victory's won
I call out for life but it's after the day
Seems so much is happening
Oh so much is happening
Will we ever see things right
That's jumping the track
Caught up in the slide
And I'll never come back
I turn around and look for a way
Nothing that I can do
Nothing that I can say
If you can't find a door
That's jumping the track
Caught up in the slide
And I'll never come back
I turn around and look for a way
Nothing that I can do
Doctor Doctor tell me if you can
What is wrong with me
I can't seem to find the key
Doctor Doctor I'm begging on my knees
Won't you tell me please
When I'm down feeling kind of low
I don't want to be the last to know
When I'm down crawling cross the floor
Doctor Doctor help me through the day
Give me something natural I can depend on
Doctor Doctor it's something that I need
It's a natural panacea
Like a cure for every fear
It's some of her sweet love
Mixed up with her young blood
True love and devotion
What a wonderful potion
Doctor Doctor why am I alone
Listening to my heart
Beating through the cold dark night
Doctor Doctor I'm shaking in the gloom
When I'm down feeling kind of low
I don't want to be the last to know
When I'm down crawling cross the floor
Doctor Doctor help me through the day
Give me something natural I can depend on
Doctor Doctor it's something that I need
It's a natural panacea
Like a cure for every fear
It's some of her sweet love
Mixed up with her young blood
True love and devotion
What a wonderful potion
Watching the world as it's singing its song
Life is for living and living is free
See how you fly you have wings of your own
Ride with the wind won't you follow me home
Turn around and see the circles we spin
And we're taking our chances on where we begin
Life is for living and living is free
See how you fly you have wings of your own
Ride with the wind won't you follow me home
Taking up time trying to write a line till the break of day
Given a sign can you make it rhyme tell me what to say
Making it fine can you ease my mind help me drift away
Taking our chances on where we begin
Life is for living and living is free
See how you fly you have wings of your own
Life is like a tall ship
Drifting gently from the shore
Time is like a fair wind
With a lifetime to explore
The beauty that surrounds you
Was meant to be adored
The problems that surround you
Were meant to be ignored
A prisoner in my hand
My hand I could not open
The man grew up inside
A prisoner without reason
Just on the other side
The blood red rose of summer
Grows elegant and tall
In memory of the green grass
Beyond the guardian wall
The green grass grows forever
Beneath the bloody sky
In memory of the martyrs
She'll cover when they die
Love was a lesson we tried to learn
There were no exams to pass or fail
Life was a lesson we've tried to learn
Fifties child was right to believe
Peace and love were our needs
War is a lesson we've had to learn
Peace is a lesson we've yet to learn
A prize for all mankind who race for the gain
Fifties child was right to believe
Peace and love were our needs
Young and old we're right to believe
Peace and love are our needs
There is something that I can see
Every time that you talk to me
And it feels like I'm gonna be
Looking from the outside
There is something I've got to say
And it's making me feel this way
Does it mean that I'm gonna stay
Looking from the outside
I might as well drift away
It seems there is no other way
Looking from the outside
Looking from the outside
Looking for the inside of you
If I say that I like your song
Will you say that you played it wrong
Or that maybe I stayed too long
Looking from the outside
If I say that you're out of line
Will you say that I'm wasting time
Looking from the outside
I might as well drift away
It seems there is no other way
Looking from the outside
Looking from the outside
She's old enough to play fast and loose
In a schoolgirl kind of way
But this teenage heart's driving me insane
The moment that we touch will ease my pain
But never finding her alone
My heart's like sand she holds in her hands
But this teenage heart's driving me insane
The moment that we touch will ease my pain
But this teenage heart's driving me insane
The moment that we touch will ease my pain
I have seen and I have heard
The story's all the same
Running here and running there
Your love is like a game
You're walking in the clouds
When I look into your eyes
I see you looking down
You've got something that I want
You've got something that I need
If there's a chance that I can see
I will follow where you lead me
But you know you're gonna fall someday
I have seen and I have heard
That you've been fooling me
You could try to make me feel
Is there any reason why
When I look into your eyes
It makes me beg for more
You've got something that I want
You've got something that I need
If there's a chance that I can see
I will follow where you lead me
I get up early in the morning
It's up and out with the sun
Spending my day making natural highs
And in the evening when my work is done
I make a phone call from the hotel
Speak to my woman each day
I tell my lady that I'm missing her
And I hope she feels the same
At least she knows that I'm not
With the midnight drug
Pouring your life in a glass of ice
And no one's laughing but the monkey in you
Paranoia for the highest price
You make a phone call from the hotel
Spending your life in the night
The kind of women who don't come for free
But then I guess they know you'll pay the price
If they can keep you up
They know you've got what turns them on
How many times must we tell you
Just how much we care
You must know how we love you
Well I've got something to tell you
If you can only take it in
I think you're worthy of a better cause
If you can just stop looking for
What you never get enough of
Your kind of sugar is a sweet club
I like my sugar in tea
You spend your life going faster
There's no surviving if you crash at speed
But that the truth is plain to see
I get my kicks from my friends and their love
It's the kind of love that comes for free
They're the kind of friends
That you don't find when you go looking for
They only pick you up then let you fall
Till you come back for more
But when the night time comes
You're gonna be alone
Even though your heart is breaking
I see it in your eyes
Even though there's no mistaking
I see there's no disguise
Waiting for the right time
To call out your name
To reach out and touch your face
We said goodbye in the morning
Streets were empty and pouring rain
Will simply fly right out of here
When I speak your name
Even though your heart is breaking
I see it in your eyes
Even though there's no mistaking
I see there's no disguise
Waiting for the right time
To call out your name
There's a beautiful sight
You know they call it tomorrow.
It's the most beautiful sight
That you'll ever see.
I know it's only a day away
And it's always in the future.
But it's that something to look forward to
That brings me closer to you.
Do you remember the time
We said we'd love until forever.
Till all the stars in the sky
Dropped one by one into the sea.
And it's always in the future.
But it's that something to look forward to
That brings me closer to you.
I know it's only a day away
And it's always in the future...
When we're together again
We'll make love until the morning light.
We'll hold each other tight
Until tomorrow comes.
I know it's only a day away
But it's always in the future.
This time you know forever I'll stay
Holding you closer to me.
I know it's just a day away
And it's always in the future...
I know it's just a day away
Met an old friend the other day
Like a ghost in a photograph
Distant memories of the past
There was Nico and Limpopo
All the old friends we've known so well
With all the stories they'll never tell
All it took was a photograph
To bring the memories chasing back
Of summer sunshine and cool green wine
And all the good times we'd left behind
If I had known then we'd be there still
We left our hearts in the soft sea spray
The wind in your hair
The feeling of the power
Through our minds move the souls
As we ride through their ancient tears
To a place to a time where
To gallop on in the breaking waves
And you talk of the times that have been
The wheels keep on turning
Turning circles we go round again
Never ending the time is bending
These songs all the same
And we will stand listening
Looking back on the ones that remain
All the words of your song
That's what you will see
The sun when it's rising
Paints a shadow on where it has been
And night is surprising
To the people who stand in between
Filling spaces you see their face
As they wake from their dream
And we will stand looking
Taking note of the things we have seen
All the words of your song
That's what you will see
I have seen the streets and alleyways
Of a million faceless towns
Filming our blues for the late night news
Never searching for our innocence
They're only there when things go wrong
Filming our blues for the late night news
Show us peace and understanding
Brother love for fellow man
In your sideshow of life
A coin they have to spend
The currency of the chosen few
They place their bets
There's world disasters by the minute
They tell us on the hour
And when we think we've paid our dues
They've filmed our blues for the late night news
Show us peace and understanding
Brother love for fellow man
In your sideshow of life
When it's late at night and you're all alone
With the one you love
Turn on the late night news and cry
Tears for all the lost and lonely people
Innocents in prime time
There's a girl that lives in the shadows
Of the street where the music plays
There she waits and looks from the outside
There's an angel in her face
But from her glass she sips a little comfort
From the boys she takes a little more
And she knows just how far she can take it
In a moment she's out on the floor
In her eyes they thought they saw a question
Maybe she is looking their way
When the music starts playing again
They say that hell hath no fury
A fact that I can't deny
I see the victims of circumstance
Convicted without a crime
Call it the need to be free
Call it the cry of the innocent
They say there's truth in the old truths
No reason to cheat or lie
We're caught in the crossfire
Convicted without a trial
This mother's scorn is a strange thing
She pays her children for love
She heeds the cry of their innocence
They pay her with their blood
They say that hell hath no fury
A fact that I can't deny
I see the victims of circumstance
Convicted without a crime
Another plane in the ocean
Another wall in the sky
The victims of circumstance
Convicted without a trial
We build them constantly
Thoughts that follow me
This is what we've become
Say you'll stay with me
Say you'll stay with me
I just want to be here
Words that call to me
Say you'll stay with me
Say you'll stay with me
I just want to be here
Can you hear those little people
They cannot see there's no tomorrow
Say you'll stay with me
The long lonely hours
To hold back the dark
To hold back the fear
But I'm not alone tonight
So help me turn the tide
Light up the flame of love
That someday we'll all
In the long lonely night
I'll hold to the fire
That's burning so bright
But we're not alone tonight
So help me turn the tide
Light up the flame of love
We're not alone tonight
So help me turn the tide
Light up the flame of love
Saw the paper the other day
Seems they've got a new way
Of fighting all their wars
Won't you listen when we say
I don't remember anyone asking me about it
Victims of circumstance that's what we are
Hidden from light so we can't see
Victims of circumstance that's what we are
Those mistakes that you all made in the past
You never seem to see
Victims of circumstance that's what we are
Hidden from light so we can't see
Victims of circumstance that's what we are
Flashing lights in the club
Memories of our wild affair
The first night we met
I just threw the dice
Making all my wildest dreams come true
I remember driving wild
She was laughing by my side
Now I live inside my nightmare
Flashing lights in the night
Memories of the girl I loved
I still feel her touch
I never loved so much
Flashing lights in the night
Memories of the cold despair
Just like a man insane
My tears fall like rain
Making all my wildest dreams come true
I remember driving wild
She was laughing by my side
Now I live inside my nightmare
Flashing lights brought me back
But they left my baby there
Making all my wildest dreams come true
Who'll never find another girl like you
I remember driving wild
She was laughing by my side
Try to see it from the other side
Keep on looking for a place to hide
You don't have to tell me
If you're trying to make your dreams come true
Then just keep on doing what you do
And if you don't break the rules
It's going to be fine
So I'm just sitting here
Watching for the dawn to break
Waiting for the time it takes
I'm living my life through the night constantly
Hope I can make it before I grow old
I could write you a song that would make your heart fly
So good for your soul
But there's something about you
That's leaving me cold
So I'm just sitting here
Watching for the dawn to break
Waiting for the time it takes
And though I think of you tonight
I cannot hope to hold you tight
But I've got this feeling in my heart
And when tomorrow I'll be gone
I've got a feeling in my heart
What's making things go wrong
You've stayed away before
It always seems so long
You know I'll always be with you
What's making things go wrong
You've stayed away before
It always seems so long
You know I'll always be with you
The touch of her body
You got the power to start me burning up
You got the kind of love I need
And you could stop the world from turning round
The kind of love I can't believe
You lock me up and throw away the key
I'm a prisoner of your love
She's a woman of wonder
Just look in her eyes
It's a spell that I'm under
You're one in a million
You're sending me crazy
You got the power to start me burning up
You got the kind of love I need
And you could stop the world from turning round
The kind of love I can't believe
You lock me up and throw away the key
I'm a prisoner of your love
I knew my eyes were open wide
And the world just seems a better place
Who was born to be king
He changed all our lives
And he made my heart sing
He turned water into wine
And called his fishermen
The blind could see again
He told us of the shepherds
And the flowers in the field
The story of the farmer's seed
And the harvest it would yield
He told us of two houses
And the man who lost his son
Of two men in the temple
And the Good Samaritan
Only love's gonna take you higher
Only love's gonna carry you home
He healed the soldier's servant
He calmed the raging sea
He shared five loaves and two small fish
And five thousand he did feed
He told the rich men share your wealth
He cured the ten sick men
He raised a friend called Lazarus
And made him whole again
Only love's gonna take you higher
Only love's gonna carry you home
He taught the children how to pray
The children he did bless
And Mary came with perfume
Before his feet she wept
He asked us all to live in peace
And nothing do but good
Now one friend did betray him
With arms outstretched he died
So all of mankind could survive
Who was born to be king
He'll change all your lives
If you'll just let him in
Only love's gonna take you higher
Only love's gonna carry you home
Love and understanding carries you home
Only love's gonna take you higher
Only love's gonna carry you home
The cold in your eyes
Like the misty breath of a whisper
The cold in your face
Like a flashing blade
And silently I froze within
The gaze from your eyes
In the dark of the night
All alone in the night
All alone in the night for your love
All alone in the night
I need you to hold me
Timeless arrows carved through
Broken hearts of stone
Shadows moving slowly across the ground
A cold reminder of the way
Now I feel the shadows
I searched in vain for love
When true love I had found
Like a blind man I could never see
Those timeless arrows pierce my soul
Ageless shadows closing in
The cold in your eyes
Like the misty breath of a whisper
You told me it was over
And silently I froze within the gaze
All alone in the night for your love
All alone in the night
Then you make me fall
With a little more love
You could make it easy
With my back to the wall
That's what I've heard
With a little more time
We could get together
In your own little world
A light shining in my life
A fire that is burning
I've never been this way before
You know that the time is right
To keep the flame burning
Turn the key and you'll open the door
With a little more love
You could make it better
Wondering where do we go
A light shining in my life
A fire that is burning
I've never been this way before
You know that the time is right
To keep the flame burning
Turn the key and you'll open the door
A light shining in my life
A fire that is burning
I've never been this way before
You know that the time is right
To keep the flame burning
Everybody's got to have a secret love
Everyone's got to be free
Free to believe that love lasts forever
Everybody's got to have a shoulder to cry on
Everyone's born with the need
The need to be loved in a moment of sadness
When you're all alone with the world on your shoulder
It's then that you'll know what I mean
Everybody's got to have their moments of coldness
Everyone's got to have warmth
After the first years are gone
You still feel the need in a moment of sadness
When you're all alone with the world on your shoulder
It's then that you'll know what I mean
It's then that you'll know what I mean
My friends it's not what you were famous for
But now the whole world's watching you
If we could help you then you know we would
But we don't know just what to do
Eye to eye our ways are not the same
We never tried to understand
But it could pass to each of us you name
Then who's the one to take the blame
You'll never be the same
Our hearts go out to you
And what you're going through
They've thrown away your past
Just like an empty glass
Someone wiser took the Steppe from you
I'm sure with reason it was right
But now it seems the whole world's blaming you
And who's the one to put things right
You'll never be the same
Our hearts go out to you
And what you're going through
They've thrown away your past
Just like an empty glass
You'll never be the same
We all will understand
You're really not to blame
They've thrown away your past
Just like an empty glass
Through the eyes of a child
There's no wrong or right
Till the child becomes a man
Hand back your rights
You're black not white
And there'll never be a piece of the action
Now you're an African
Forget beliefs and swallow your pain
You're just a number now
And you'll never get a piece of the action
Now you're a working man
It's power they crave
The politics of Apartheid
The politics of shame
The cold abuse of human rights
Of torture and of pain
Are only part of the action
When you're an African
The politics of making more
The politics of greed
The cold abuse of poverty
Are only part of the action
When you're a working man
It's power they crave
The politics of buying arms
When there's no food to eat
The politics of digging gold
Instead of planting seeds
The leader with his private golf course
Sits playing with his diamond wrist watch
While the people starve
The politics of shooting down
A plane that brings relief
By fat men playing power games
Who've got enough to eat
The politics of racial hate
The men who sell the guns have fun
While we all count the score
People dying just to keep
Through the eyes of a man
There's wrong and there's right
There's need for a fight
Light shining into my eyes
You wandered into my life
Without your sweet love
Where in the world would I be
Voice echoes into the night
You giving me your heart
I know that the feeling is right
Without your sweet love
Where in the world would I be
Take a chance for our lives to be free
That's the way that we want it to be
I can see a new tomorrow
And the song we'll sing together
High above the clouds we're drifting
Can you feel the music lift you
Light shining into my eyes
You wandered into my life
Without your sweet love
Where in the world would I be
It's been a long long time
Thought you were a friend of mine
Holding on the end of the line
I've been waiting for you
Seen the way the wind is blowing
Look around and I don't know
If the time is right or wrong
I've been waiting so long
I've been waiting for you
Can't get away from your love
I've been searching up and down
Watching as the world goes round
Just another boy in town
I was looking for love
See the way the rain is falling
Black as night and I keep calling
I walk on and on and on and on...
I've been waiting for you
When you hear the music stop
Never let the silence win
Turn the record on again
When you hear the music stop
Never let them turn you down
Volume up and record round
When you hear the music stop
If they get under your skin
Give the disc another spin
If they try to shut you up
Never let them shout you down
Volume up and record round
When you hear the music fade
Raise your hands up to the sky
Never let the volume die
When you hear the rhythm slow
Stamp your feet upon the ground
Volume up and record round
Each night the same songs
As I look for your face
In the shadows of the front row
Like birds in the winter time
Every day it's another lonely ride
Was a time when you'd be here by my side
Now I stand alone with my guitar and play
As I wait by the telephone
Maybe you'll be there
But hope slowly fades
Like the lights in a stage show
Every day it's another lonely ride
Was a time when you'd be here by my side
Close my eyes and dream the time away
Like the shadows in the night
Count the hours until the break of day
There's something missing from my life
Can you see me as you listen to the radio
Hope the message carries through
This song I sing is just for you
And I think it's gonna be all right
Sailing into the night
And it seems like an endless flight
Way out in the lonely night
It's just a matter of time
Till we see the morning light
And I think it's gonna be all right
Sailing into the night
And it seems like an endless flight
The touch of her body
You got the power to start me burning up
You got the kind of love I need
And you could stop the world from turning round
The kind of love I can't believe
You lock me up and throw away the key
I'm a prisoner of your love
She's a woman of wonder
Just look in her eyes
It's a spell that I'm under
You're one in a million
You're sending me crazy
You got the power to start me burning up
You got the kind of love I need
And you could stop the world from turning round
The kind of love I can't believe
You lock me up and throw away the key
I'm a prisoner of your love
I knew my eyes were open wide

Only love's gonna take you higher
Only love's gonna carry you home
The cold in your eyes

The cold in your face
Like a flashing blade
And silently I froze within

All alone in the night for your love

With a little more love
You could make it better
Wondering where do we go
A light shining in my life
A fire that is burning
I've never been this way before
You know that the time is right
To keep the flame burning
Turn the key and you'll open the door
A light shining in my life
A fire that is burning

My friends it's not what you were famous for
But now the whole world's watching you
If we could help you then you know we would
But we don't know just what to do
Eye to eye our ways are not the same
We never tried to understand
But it could pass to each of us you name
Then who's the one to take the blame
You'll never be the same
Our hearts go out to you
And what you're going through
They've thrown away your past
Just like an empty glass
Someone wiser took the Steppe from you
I'm sure with reason it was right
But now it seems the whole world's blaming you
And who's the one to put things right
You'll never be the same
Our hearts go out to you
And what you're going through
They've thrown away your past
Just like an empty glass
You'll never be the same
We all will understand
You're really not to blame
They've thrown away your past
Just like an empty glass
There's a life that burns
When the night has come
Can't believe that you want it to be
Just the game and we're playing the parts
Like an arrow that's straight for the heart
That's what people say
And the life you lead
Is the one you choose
Tell me why you fill up my life this way
Can't believe that you want it to be
Just a game and we're playing the parts
Like an arrow that's straight for the heart
That's what people say
Too many people can't find a way
And the life you lead
Is the one you choose
Like a jester dressed
Something evil came to town
All who'd listen gathered round
From the tortured sounds
No one noticed what she'd done
By the pricking of my thumbs
Something wicked this way comes
Like a fool possessed
Evil grabbed the blade
Dripping blood upon the keys
With her cheap disguise
How this jester could deceive
From the tortured sounds
No one noticed what she'd done
By the pricking of my thumbs
Something wicked this way comes
From the tortured sounds
No one noticed what she'd done
And her lies linger on
By the pricking of my thumbs
Something wicked this way comes
By the pricking of my thumbs
Something wicked this way comes
The streets run red with the blood of the innocent
We stab our knives in the back of humanity
There's never peace just a spiral of violence
We'll shoot you down for a difference of opinion
We fill their ears with the drums and the battle cries
They burn your car when you stray it's a game they play
They're fed on hate it's a circle we don't want to break
I'm confirmed with your hate
I'm ordained into violence
I'm a child of the modern world
We can't all be right
We can't all be wrong
Though it's heartbreaking
Somewhere on the road
Those who laugh the first
Must cry later they say
And they surely do well
For the politicians who sell them
Of who runs the world
Somewhere on the road
Are as one in the minds of today
With their eyes open they can't see the signs
And the moment belongs to the video songs
Leading nowhere at all
Somewhere on the road
Back in the autumn of seventy
On the night shift at Abbey Road
For an album they'd call Once Again
The producer was Norman Smith
Who'd engineered with The Beatles and John
Whose guitar was to be instrumental that day
The day that I played John Lennon's guitar
The day that I played John Lennon's guitar
Back in the autumn of seventy
As I played on my borrowed guitar
How could I know The Beatles would split the next day
My heroes break up and go their own way
Now autumns they came and they go
But my friends and my memories remain
But their light still remains
The day that I played John Lennon's guitar
The day that I played John Lennon's guitar
The day that I played John Lennon's guitar
And I know that the memories will never fade
And you're halfway to freedom
But we've got the love
And the feeling's strong
And we can't go wrong
Our voice can be heard
Love like a cry in the night
We reach out for each other
And you're halfway to freedom
Our voice can be heard
Driving down the road
Under the southern light
Where we've come from
As we watched the sun go down
Rain it fell like diamonds
Stopped a while to stretch my thoughts
As we crossed the borderline
I saw the sun go down
Under the southern skies
Those beautiful African nights
The stories that he told us
Sang and played his guitar
Driving down the road
We hear the morning rise
The sound man played the Eagles
Echoes on through our lives
I saw the sun go down
Under the southern skies
I still hear them call
Talk about a heavy scene
I'm a psychedelic child
Talk about a heavy scene
I'm a psychedelic child
And the power of a rock and roll dream
I'm a psychedelic child
I'm a psychedelic child
Talk about a heavy scene
I'm a psychedelic child
And the power of a rock and roll dream
I'm a psychedelic child
And the power of a rock and roll dream
When you're all alone
And the dreams are waiting at your door
Where did we go wrong
When you're worlds apart
All feelings seem to disappear
And the night is dark
You used to make it all so clear
Where did we go wrong
Where did we go wrong
Lost generations out of place
Lovely visions from before our birth
And the pictures say origin Earth
I never lost my heart to anyone
But I lost my heart today
Somehow we must find a way
Rivers of gold and mountains so high
Visions haunt now like an ancient curse
And the pictures say origin Earth
I never lost my heart to anyone
But I lost my heart today
Guiding us back to a new tomorrow
A blind man in the night
Looking for a way down
Prophet of an unknown
Just looking for a way home
A rich man taking fright
Looking for the lowdown
Just looking for a safe bet
If music be the food of love
Then someone ate the crown
A no count in the light
Looking for a way out
Saviour of the closed door
Just looking for a cool floor
And you're out feeling great
Shooting for a high break
Prisoner of the real king
Just looking for a sure thing
If music be the food of love
If music be the food of love
See the river deep and wide
Could be free on the other side
When the gun and the knife have gone
Who'll be here when tomorrow comes
Over the rainbow they fly
Hear the sound that fills the skies
Killer man with dollar eyes
When you hear the sound of a gun
Over the rainbow they fly
And as far as the eye can see
Black as night is the cloud you're under
There's a chance that it cannot be
Hear the cries like the rolling thunder
Over the rainbow they fly
All around we're caught in the light of a thousand suns
Riding the wind of eternal years
Watching the Earth die before our eyes
Hearing the world crying in our ears
And there's burning sand where the cornfields were before
And the air we breathe doesn't taste good any more
We kill the land till there isn't any food to eat
And we fire our guns and we're fighting all our wars
See the children die like a movie on the silver screen
Now the air we breathe doesn't taste good any more
We are sinking in the water
Cast adrift on the open sea
Once more into the night
Nothing left for your sons and your daughters
We're on our ship called Earth for all eternity
We are sinking in the water
Cast adrift on the open sea
Once more into the night
Nothing left for your sons and your daughters
We're on our ship called Earth for all eternity
Do we believe there's someone watching over us
Do we believe there's someone watching over us
I can feel the wild west highland breeze
Drive all my fears away
I can't wait for heaven's gate
It's paradise I'm looking on
Feel the silence calling all around
Heaven and hell beneath
And Nevis where the angels meet
Heals a tortured soul
Brings new life to tired minds
And brightens eyes that look upon
Feel the silence calling all around
Ugly bastards one and all
We'll gather just to look upon
Feel the silence calling all around
Feel the silence calling
Hear the silence calling
Feel the silence calling
Gone you sons of darkness
Gone you tyrants of old
Here in the outfield of Europe
A cry for freedom was heard
Rang out to the world
And we all stood watching
Keep it burning so bright
Must they live so long In the shadows
Like many times before
Once there was a proud people
Filled with laughter and song
Could they feel something wrong
The fight for freedom began
The fight for life still goes on
Keep it burning so bright
Must they live so long In the shadows
Like many times before
I've been so sad since you went away
I've been so lost without you
I wanted to hold on and tell you
I never thought that this day would come
Never dreamed we'd have to part
And now that you're gone and there's only memories
Whenever skies are cloudy and the raindrops fall
I pray that you'll be waiting to catch me when I fall
So many words that were left unsaid
So many things still to share
I hope that you know how much I cared
Whenever skies are cloudy and the raindrops fall
I pray that you'll be waiting to catch me when I fall
I've been so sad since you went away
I've been so lost without you
I wanted to hold on and tell you
I never thought that this day would come
Never dreamed we'd have to part
And now that you're gone and there's only memories
See the bombers riding
See our hearts are broken
So many lives are gone
Waiting for this dream to end
We'll live on forever
We're heading for glory
The fears of the past
Chills you to the bone
Praying for the silence
Lost without a friend
Searching for a reason
Waiting for this dream to end
We'll live on forever
We're heading for glory
The fears of the past
The royal George it was that brought the Countess to our door
She wanted us to leave the hills for crofts upon the moor
She took our piece of paradise and left us on the shore
They cleared us from our highland homes by ship to foreign glens
All lovers in the night
Look up and see the dawn
Reach out into the light
All you have to do is smile for me
Lonely days will disappear
All lovers of the world
We thought we had it all
Reach out and touch someone
Across the great unknown
All you have to do is smile for me
Lonely nights will disappear
Promises are soon forgotten
Watch them falling one by one
Nothing stays the same forever
See the years go on and on they fly
We'll wait for the day
Reach out for someone
All you have to do is smile for me
Lonely nights will disappear
Taking over all the kids you've ever seen
Locked into the screen
Jabbing at the buttons like they're in a dream
Don't want a Mega drive
And lots of records that'll make me scream
Give me the radio playing all the songs I know
Don't want no Game Boy just a rock and roll
Oh a oh give me a radio
Don't want a Game Boy just rock and roll
Oh a oh give me a radio
Don't want a system that ain't got no soul
Virtual reality taking over grown ups like you've never seen
Locked into the screen
Don't want a Mega drive
And lots of records that'll make me scream
Give me the radio playing all the songs I know
Don't want no Game Boy just a rock and roll
Oh a oh give me a radio
Don't want a Game Boy just rock and roll
Oh a oh give me a radio
Don't want a system that's not rock and roll
Oh a oh give me a radio
Don't want a Game Boy just rock and roll
Oh a oh give me a radio
Don't want a system that ain't got no soul
Simulation junkies when the game's for real
And the game's for free
Don't give me a Mega drive
And lots of music that'll make me scream
No mean machine in my dreams
I want you for the things you do
No more Game Boy just want rock and roll
No more Top Gun just want rock and roll
No more smart bombs just want rock and roll
No more Game Boy just want rock and roll
Oh a oh give me a radio
Don't want a Game Boy just rock and roll
Oh a oh give me a radio
Don't want a system that's not rock and roll
Oh a oh give me a radio
Don't want a Game Boy just rock and roll
Oh a oh give me a radio
Don't want a system that ain't got no soul
Oh a oh give me a radio
Don't want smart bombs just rock and roll
Oh a oh give me a radio
Love grown cold as ice melted with the rain
After all these years
Can't believe it's true
To take away the pain
I just want to be with you again
We broke the things we made
Love like lightning ended in the rain
You're still the only one
To take away the pain
I just want to be with you again
To take away the pain
With these arms I'll hold you
Let my love enfold you
Night and day forever
Born in the spirit of love
Soaring so high and so free
You'll always be heard
Our hearts know the truth
In pools of blue I found you
Let my love surround you
From that day forever
Born in the spirit of love
Soaring so high and so free
You'll always be heard
Our hearts know the truth
Born in the spirit of love
Soaring so high and so free
You'll always be heard
They'll never kill the mockingbird
It's a matter of time before we know
We can talk for a while and that's all right
I can see in your eyes what you feel inside
You don't know what you've been doing
Leave me standing here
We are on the edge of reality
Not the way that it's meant to be
It's a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
It's a matter of time before we say
We got out of line looking for the way
You can stay for a while and that's all right
I see in your smile what you feel tonight
You don't know what you've been doing
Leave us standing here
We are on the edge of reality
Not the way that it's meant to be
It's a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
Are you really looking for someone
Take another look and you will see
That I will be waiting
It's a matter of time
It's a matter of time
On a cold starry night in the winter time
Stood three old men by a mill pond in the moonlight
And they spoke of their young men in the front line
How they all wished them home for the Christmas time
As they spoke from the east came a bright light
And it sparkled like pure gold in their sad eyes
Are you blind can you not see
A hole as rotten as ever fouled the green earth
Yet there's many a poor boy in foreign climes
Who would think this old mill now a palace fine
As she spoke from the mill there came laughter
Came the warm sounds of their young men like a summer breeze
And they rose in the night like fire bright
Are you blind can you not see
With the old men who believed they came home that night
To the warmth of their homes at Christmas time
Oh those crazy nights
Oh those days are gone
Make me feel that I want to be
Back in the game again
Where there's no tomorrow
High upon those summer nights
Oh those crazy nights
Oh those days are gone
Make me feel that I want to be
Back in the game again
Take me where the music's playing
Where there's no tomorrow
High upon those summer nights if
When I was a young man
Something to believe in
Now looking at the big lie
Looking back on my life
I'm adding up the zeros
In the book of might have been
When I was a young man
Someone to be seen with
Now looking at the big lie
Looking back on my life
In the river of my dreams
All that dirty water in my dreams
When I was a young man
Playing in the big lights
Trouble came for free
Now looking at the big lie
Looking back on my life
Trying to find the good seed
All that dirty water in my dreams
All that dirty water in my dreams
When I was a young man
Took me to the fast lane
Answered all my needs
Now looking at the big lie
Looking back on my life
All it did was show me
All the things that might have been
All that dirty water in my dreams
All that dirty water in my dreams
All that dirty water in my dreams
And so the time has come
To fight for right or wrong
To save us from ourselves
Born in the age of innocence
I can see the rain begin to fall
Watch as the wind blows
Can you hear those voices when they call
A game of consequence
We have to take the chance
To keep the past alive
A lesson to be learned
To keep the flame from burning
I can see the rain begin to fall
Watch as the wind blows
Can you hear those voices when they call
Here we're helplessly
I can see the rain begin to fall
Watch as the wind blows
Can you hear those voices when they call
He was born on easy streets
Played so hard his feet they
Never touched the ground
Hour after shining hour
No thought of time no parents worrying
Closing his eyes on a new tomorrow
Crying for the disappeared
She grew up on easy streets
Danced so hard her feet they
Never touched the ground
No locks on their front door
She'd stay out late and
They'd know she was safe
Closing his eyes on a new tomorrow
Crying for the disappeared
My my look at that sky
Turning his back on a generation
And no one wants to take the blame
Blame for children of the disappeared
Turning his back on a new tomorrow
Their life with never be the same
For children who disappear
And parents who live in fear
No more the easy streets
No sound of children's footsteps on the ground
No more the unlocked door
No more the children laughing as they play
Nowhere left that's safe
Closing his eyes on a new tomorrow
Crying for the disappeared
Turning his back on a generation
And no one wants to take the blame
The truth is never easy
And the game of life is hard
It's Devil take the loser
When love is hard to find
I'm living in a cold world
And winter's got my heart
I thought it was for ever
Just when I thought that I'd got things right
You turned your back on me
Just when I thought that
I'd worked things out
You said please set me free
Turned your back on me
It wasn't just a good thing
I never would have stayed
You brought me to your altar
And at your feet I prayed
Your beauty I believed in
And no shadow crossed my heart
I thought it was for ever
Just when I thought that I'd got things right
You turned your back on me
Just when I thought that I'd worked things out
You said please set me free
Turned your back on me
Why did I never think the clouds would break
The sky would rain a pool of tears
Now as the mist comes down this voice cries out in fear
Just when I thought that I'd got things right
You turned your back on me
Just when I thought that I'd worked things out
You said please set me free
Just when I thought that I'd got things right
You turned your back on me
Just when I thought that I'd worked things out
You said please set me free and
Turned your back on me
That floats upon the air above
That's falling on the only ones
And the way you see your life
Returns us to the way
In the years of sacrifice
You'll open up your eyes
Standing at your door
Right time turn it on
That's waiting for the only one
Open up and sing the song
And the way you see your life
To preserve your sanity
When others lose control
And the years we spent
Heaven blessed or heaven sent
Sang where kings and presidents
Could change the world
If you ask me I don't know.
After all is said and done
Same chance for everyone
If you ask us we can't say
When did the music go away
After all is said and done
Same chance for everyone
The mountain we're climbing
We're reaching so high
We're looking for someone
It's hurting too much
And we're searching so far
When the best has gone
I know just where I'm going
Know that you're the one
You're lighting up the fire
And the mountains we climb
And we're wondering why
It's hurting too much
And we're searching so far
I know just where I'm going
Know that you're the one
You're lighting up the fire
If I had to spend my life
I would rather be here
We will live and learn
We can never be alone
Know just where I'm going
Know that you're the one
You're lighting up the fire
I know that you think I'm the lonely one
Those black clouds always follow me
No silver lining there for you to find
And every day you're searching hard
For something you can't find
Broken dreams and promises
The feelings you can't hide
You fool yourself there's nothing wrong
I'll take your truth and give you back a lie
My secret lives in your deceit
Innocence crumbles in the face of your greed
That's why they call me Mr. E
And every day you're searching hard
For something you can't find
With pictures for the blind
My vision is a window to the
This blindness is the way you feel
About yourself and no one else
Let me take you down to the river side
Hold your hand and lead you in
I can take you down to the river side
But only you can swim
I know no magic forest in this part of town
That's why they call me Mr. E
And every day you're searching hard
For something you can't find
A nightmare's what you find
My promise is a window to
The bottom of your soul
This nightmare is the way you feel
About yourself and no one else
Let me take you down to the river side
I can take you down to the river side
But only you can swim
Hold your hand and lead you in
I can take you down to the river side
Time now an empty shell
Memories in the broken glass
The daily journey to despair
And she wants to run away
And the rain falls and the night calls
In the shadows we've all passed
Life like an empty book
With pictures that fade and die
Tears in a bottle of dreams
Schemes that never last
And the rain falls and the night calls
In the shadows we've all passed
Reality in a paper cup
Empty in a hungry world
And they want to run away
And the rain falls and the night calls
In the shadows we've all passed
Rain falls and the night calls
In the shadows we've all passed
Behind every tatty sleeping bag
And cardboard box there is a human being
Sail on the wind of a stormy sea
Wake from the sound of an age
This is the time of our lives
Out on the streets and boulevards
A future of uncertainty
The word against the gun
The time of our lives
Through a darkened sky
We never wanted to be
In the name of reality
And constantly we plant
The seeds of hatred in
The children of the world
Out on the streets and boulevards
A future of uncertainty
The word against the gun.
We are the ones who could change it all
She walks on through the night
Her circumstances slight
Are only helping her to fail
And though she feels she's right
She tries with all her might
And makes the deepest peril pale
She chooses who to love
And then unlike a dove
She takes the laughter from their smile
She wears a velvet glove
Her friends may find it rough
It is a gauntlet all the while
Even the bad times are good when you're round
Even the hard times are easy to face
There ain't nothing that you cannot do
As I shoot all my love into you
You know that's the best way to feel it
Just get a hold and watch how it grows.
Now even the bad times are good when you're round
Even the hard times are easy to face
Then you grab for my heart you just tear it apart
As I shoot all my love in your fire
We used to have a jungle out there
We used to be a people that cared
No longer can we look the other way
We know that a change is gonna come
We must appreciate what life's about
We gotta raise our voices and shout
Are we really too blind to see
We can't see the forest for the trees
Tell me can't you hear nature's cry
How can we preserve our dignity
When we let our heritage bleed
We can't let another day go by
It's one for all and all for one
We must appreciate what life's about
We gotta raise our voices and shout
Help us conquer the storm
Lead us to a place save and warm
Save the world if you can
We must appreciate what life's about
We gotta raise our voices and shout
Stand up everybody and let your voice be heard
It's time to look inside your heart
It's time to make a brand new start
So won't you listen when we say
On a cold misty night
A victim to take by surprise.
She's the Golden Gate Park killer
She's the scourge of Frisco Bay
Where she got herself beat up
By a man she felt true love for
But who left her out of hand.
Now she's out to take revenge on every man
As she stands there with a pistol in her hand.
She looks in his eyes
He goes for the gun in her hand.
And got it right between the eyes.
She's the Golden Gate Park killer
She's the scourge of Frisco Bay
Where she got herself beat up
By a man she felt true love for
But who left her out of hand.
Now she's out to take revenge on every man
In corridors of air the clouds were waiting there
They knew that never again the skies would be so blue
They took away the sun and with it took the fun
So I look outside my window at the sheets of pouring rain
And I wonder if the sun will come again
But the sun will never shine the way it used to do
The clouds won't let it through
Oh the sun will never shine its smile for me and you
The clouds won't let it through
It wasn't long ago the people that I knew were glad
And nothing they ever thought about was sad
But since the sun has gone their laughing times are none
So they look outside their window at the sheets of pouring rain
And they wonder if the sun will come again
But the sun will never shine the way it used to do
The clouds won't let it through
Oh the sun will never shine its smile for me and you
How come you happened to be hanging around
I thought I always had my feet on the ground
I've got the feeling that it won't be for long.
You're moving too fast.
But let's make it last.
The way you're dancing
Ain't good for my soul.
The situation's getting out of control.
How come you happened to be hanging around
I thought I always had my feet on the ground
I've got the feeling that I'm spinning and spinning.
But you are more than I await
You fill in every shortfall
Looking for a light on
And you're glowing like a candle
It's more than physical
Baby it's supernatural
You're like a miracle
Want you to know that
Becoming road on every step
You're like a lighthouse
When I see me through your eyes
It's like I've found the other half of me
Dreaming of a deep white
And you're bringing me to brightness
Baby I'm a loud noise
Looking for a low voice
It's more than physical
Baby it's supernatural
You're like a miracle
Green is always looking for another tone
We are only one in a certain way so
Let me be the red one
Let me be forever the yin
It's more than physical
Baby it's supernatural
You're like a miracle
Stay here and light the way
You're in love with every sun around the weather girl
I can see the wind just blowing us away
I'd never felt so amazing
You never had such a healthy glow
You're in love with every sun around the weather girl
Every rainy day that makes her feel blue
I can see the wind just blowing us away
You're in love with her and I love you
Why we have lunch on the sofa
Why you don't say a word
Fixing your gaze on her
Why you don't ever go for a run
Without a raincoat on
Humming that fucking song
You're in love with every sun around the weather girl
Every rainy day that makes her feel blue
I can see the wind just blowing us away
You're in love with her and I love you
This is just an idiot box
It never gonna happen
I've been looking for
Everything about that whore
And dammit she lives next door
You're in love with every sun around the weather girl
I can see the wind just blowing us away
You're in love with every sun around the weather girl
Every rainy day that makes her feel blue
I can see the wind just blowing us away
You're in love with her and I love you
We made love like no one could've done
We woke up beside a cranny between your skin and my skin
The second time it's not a charm
Look how far we've come
Falling time and time again for nothing
It has been a long and bumpy road
I don't wanna a life of wishful thinking
We both know two wrongs don't ever make a right
Anytime every other day
Why do you show the ace of hearts
Just when the stars are falling under
Look how far we've come
Falling time and time again for nothing
It has been a long and bumpy road
I don't wanna a life of wishful thinking
Walls are falling down
Look how far we've come
Falling time and time again for nothing
It has been a long and bumpy road
I don't wanna a life of wishful thinking
You didn't know the race was over
You had to ride with all your skill
The wildest horses...
Who made the mountains
You had that fire in your eyes
To cover thousands...
That we don't have a reason
To feel like a free fall...
We don't need to face it so bad
In every leaf under the trees...
Who gave you heartbeat
And you had to stop it when you danced
Who made the blue sky
You had the bluest light inside
That we had swum in...
That we don't have a reason
To feel like a free fall...
We don't need to face it so bad
In every leaf under the trees...
I don't belong to a different kind...
Sometimes I feel like I'm from another
Don't understand why we kill each other still
We do it all again going round in circles
Holding up the mess...
Losing any trace of common sense
No more good no more bad
No more fictional rivals
It's not that easy when you hurt inside...
You gotta try to find the light
You gotta throw the dice
It's not that easy trying to turn the tide...
Too many fools arriving high...
It's time to mend this human crime
We cannot hold our love plenty of fears
And I don't know why not
We focus on revenge just to get the further
Choosing any way to do the worst
No more good no more bad
No more fictional rivals
It's not that easy when you hurt inside...
You gotta try to find the light
You gotta throw the dice
It's not that easy trying to turn the tide...
Too many fools arriving high...
It's time to mend this human crime
It's not that easy when you hurt inside...
You gotta try to find the light
You gotta throw the dice
You gotta throw the dice
Too many fools arriving high...
There is something killing who I am
And what I'm looking for
There is something telling me to be submissive
I can feel your words like fire on my knees
Pushing me to be right
It's my time to be free
To be more than you need...
Somehow I don't feel allowed to put myself first
When I start to dream
Somewhere deep inside
My heart is out of beat
What do you want from me
Trying to make me feel
Even if you're dying inside your mind...
You're hiding all your doubts
You don't seem to feel alive...
I don't wanna die die inside
You don't have to hide hide
I don't wanna live forever
Life doesn't mean anything
If you're feeling dead...
But you keep on smiling
You don't seem to be right
But you never cross the line...
You're losing who you are
Everything you're dreaming
You refuse all the signs
And you cannot sleep at night
I don't wanna die die inside
You don't have to hide hide
You don't need to dream
I don't wanna live forever
I don't wanna die die inside
You don't need to dream another's life...
You said you would rather be alone...
You just wanna do it on your own...
You claim you don't feel anything at all...
Same time but never goes on for too long
And I don't wanna come back home
Baby you're trying to fake there's nothing more
Now tell me... Are you sure
Now tell me... Are you sure
Nobody could find it easy...
But I really miss your body
This desire is burning out in my hands like fire...
You set alight flames inside us
And then you turn it all into sawdust...
You said you would rather be alone...
Building a place far away from harm...
Now tell me... Are you sure
Now tell me... Are you sure
Nobody could find it easy...
But I really miss your body
This desire is burning out in my hands like fire...
You set alight flames inside us
And then you turn it all into sawdust...
Nobody could find it easy...
But I really miss your body
This desire is burning out in my hands like fire...
You set alight flames inside us
And then you turn it all into sawdust...
In a prison without mission...
Don't know why but there must be a hefty reason...
All you see is an open window full of freedom
Far away from where you are... kinda fiction...
You don't need a weapon to fix it...
Every little fight is a new chance...
You gotta face another day...
To start it all again... getting up from every downfall
Just do it till the end...
Just be true to yourself
You you you're aiming at the wrong direction...
There must be a secret door among the action
Life is nicer than you see it from commotion
But you got all the powers to escape it...
Every little war has a winner...
You gotta face another day...
Every night you let me in
Make me fall in love again
You are my silver lining everywhere...
Chasing rainbows with no sun
Just a dream of reaching to your heart...
Getting used to everything you are
Sacrifice is when I leave all that I need behind...
Is when I see you crying asking why...
Trying to step down every night...
Falling for you when you smile...
Hard to believe that you will not be mine
We can be the way we are
Only when there's no one else around...
There she comes to pull me from the sky
Sacrifice is when I leave all that I need behind...
Is when I see you crying asking why...
Is when I realize that I've been blind...
Is everything that you don't mind...
Sacrifice for nothing...
Sacrifice for nothing...
Sacrifice for nothing...
Sacrifice for nothing...
Sacrifice... screaming out in silence
Sacrifice... when you're here surrounding
Sacrifice is when I leave all that I need behind...
Is when I see you crying asking why...
Is when I realize that I've been blind...
Is everything that you don't mind...
Sacrifice for nothing...
Sacrifice for nothing...
Sacrifice for nothing...
I fell head over heels for you...
Neither what I felt inside...
I'm feeling like I'm losing part of me...
And I'm trying to get back
I don't wanna lose you...
I'm feeling we're becoming memories
Nothing could've made us fall down...
Tell me what I'm supposed to do...
Neither what I felt inside...
I'm feeling like I'm losing part of me...
And I'm trying to get back
I don't wanna lose you...
I'm feeling we're becoming memories
They never wallow in their fate
More than a thousand miles until the end
We're never gonna know what lies ahead
To learn from our yesterday
Come on and raise your battle cry
You are the one who never dies
You keep on climbing over hills
Right now you're following your dreams
I know by heart my shades
I got the light between my breaks
More than a thousand wounds upon my hands
Of every time I fought them face to face
We go through our mistakes
To find the way to go back straight
Come on and raise your battle cry
You are the one who never dies
You keep on climbing over hills
Right now you're following your dreams
Raise up your battle cry
I am always ready if you want me to
Kind of slave of everything you do
But I won't make it that easy
I can give you whatever but you better give me thrills
Baby I want you to show me
You're a kind of super ranger
Feeling terror in the spotlight
Show me you can boogie
You could be my super ranger
But you gotta make it so right
I can see you're working out just for me
So let it all in my hands
But I won't make it that easy
I could give you whatever
Baby I want you to show me
You're a kind of super ranger
Feeling terror in the spotlight
Show me you can boogie
You could be my super ranger
But you gotta make it so right
Gotta show me your moves...
Baby I just wanna feel the night
Show me your moves...
Baby I just wanna feel the night
Show me you can boogie
I wanna feel the night
You're a kind of super ranger
Feeling terror in the spotlight
Show me you can boogie
You could be my super ranger
But you gotta make it so right
Gotta show me your moves...
Baby I just wanna feel the night
Show me your moves...
But you are more than I await
You fill in every shortfall
Looking for a light on
And you're glowing like a candle
It's more than physical
Baby it's supernatural
You're like a miracle
Want you to know that
Becoming road on every step
You're like a lighthouse
When I see me through your eyes
It's like I've found the other half of me
Dreaming of a deep white
And you're bringing me to brightness
Baby I'm a loud noise
Looking for a low voice
It's more than physical
Baby it's supernatural
You're like a miracle
Green is always looking for another tone
We are only one in a certain way so
Let me be the red one
Let me be forever the yin
It's more than physical
Baby it's supernatural
You're like a miracle
Stay here and light the way
There's another way to stand up
I don't mind if you come like another kind of savior
You can seem to feel much better
And baby you can stamp all alone
I won't tell you twice
That would make you wiser
That would make you braver
You can keep on breaking
Sorry just set your site
Taking over march shoes
Overwhelmed is so good
It's unloved to end it up in shut up
I don't care if you want to become a supernova
Never mind if you're lost
To get just a blacker deeper
I'll call you for a dinner
But if I never do it you know...
Blessings in the skies
I was thinking to stay
Want to move it all day
Hey you spare long time
I'm ready for the light
Taking over march shoes
Overwhelmed is so good
It's unloved to end it up in shut up
You know my old behavior
I don't remember what I saw in you
Taking over march shoes
Overwhelmed is so good
Taking over march shoes
Overwhelmed is so good
It's unloved to end it up in shut up
It's unloved to end it up in shut up
It's unloved to end it up in shut up
I don't belong to a different kind...
Sometimes I feel like I'm from another
Don't understand why we kill each other still
We do it all again going round in circles
Holding up the mess...
Losing any trace of common sense
No more good no more bad
No more fictional rivals
It's not that easy when you hurt inside...
You gotta try to find the light
You gotta throw the dice
It's not that easy trying to turn the tide...
Too many fools arriving high...
It's time to mend this human crime
We cannot hold our love plenty of fears
And I don't know why not
We focus on revenge just to get the further
Choosing any way to do the worst
No more good no more bad
No more fictional rivals
It's not that easy when you hurt inside...
You gotta try to find the light
You gotta throw the dice
It's not that easy trying to turn the tide...
Too many fools arriving high...
It's time to mend this human crime
It's not that easy when you hurt inside...
You gotta try to find the light
You gotta throw the dice
You gotta throw the dice
Too many fools arriving high...
You didn't know the race was over
You had to ride with all your skill
The wildest horses...
Who made the mountains
You had that fire in your eyes
To cover thousands...
That we don't have a reason
To feel like a free fall...
We don't need to face it so bad
In every leaf under the trees...
Who gave you heartbeat
And you had to stop it when you danced
Who made the blue sky
You had the bluest light inside
That we had swum in...
That we don't have a reason
To feel like a free fall...
We don't need to face it so bad
In every leaf under the trees...
We made love like no one could've done
We woke up beside a cranny between your skin and my skin
The second time it's not a charm
Look how far we've come
Falling time and time again for nothing
It has been a long and bumpy road
I don't wanna a life of wishful thinking
We both know two wrongs don't ever make a right
Anytime every other day
Why do you show the ace of hearts
Just when the stars are falling under
Look how far we've come
Falling time and time again for nothing
It has been a long and bumpy road
I don't wanna a life of wishful thinking
Walls are falling down
Look how far we've come
Falling time and time again for nothing
It has been a long and bumpy road
I don't wanna a life of wishful thinking
You said you would rather be alone...
You just wanna do it on your own...
You claim you don't feel anything at all...
Same time but never goes on for too long

Somehow I don't feel allowed to put myself first
When I start to dream
Somewhere deep inside
My heart is out of beat
What do you want from me
Trying to make me feel
You're in love with every sun around the weather girl
I can see the wind just blowing us away
I'd never felt so amazing
You never had such a healthy glow
You're in love with every sun around the weather girl
Every rainy day that makes her feel blue
I can see the wind just blowing us away
You're in love with her and I love you
Why we have lunch on the sofa
Why you don't say a word
Fixing your gaze on her
Why you don't ever go for a run
Without a raincoat on
Humming that fucking song
You're in love with every sun around the weather girl
Every rainy day that makes her feel blue
I can see the wind just blowing us away
You're in love with her and I love you
This is just an idiot box
It never gonna happen
I've been looking for
Everything about that whore
And dammit she lives next door
You're in love with every sun around the weather girl
I can see the wind just blowing us away
You're in love with every sun around the weather girl
Every rainy day that makes her feel blue
I can see the wind just blowing us away
You're in love with her and I love you
Every night you let me in
Make me fall in love again

I fell head over heels for you...
Neither what I felt inside...
I'm feeling like I'm losing part of me...
And I'm trying to get back
I don't wanna lose you...
I'm feeling we're becoming memories
Nothing could've made us fall down...
Tell me what I'm supposed to do...
Neither what I felt inside...
I'm feeling like I'm losing part of me...
And I'm trying to get back
I don't wanna lose you...
I'm feeling we're becoming memories
We feel better when we are together
Close your eyes and we will be forever one
I can show you all the things that I am
So hold my hand and roll on your travel
We wanna have a good time
The things you need to
I wanna show you the way
I wanna show you the way
I'll never let you down
Now the key is in your hands
You have the time to spend
Look around the streets
The lights show us the way
The city is full of places
Where we will start to
The things you need to
I wanna show you the way
I wanna show you the way
I'll never let you down
The things you need to
I wanna show you the way
I wanna show you the way
I'll never let you down
You and me will be together
So close your eyes and we will be forever one
You need me and I need you to be forever one
People staring all around
So put your hands up to the sun
Break your back into the ground
Your name is written on the wall
And we'll never let it fall
Fight because it's time
There is no failure when you give it all
There is no worthy trophy
There is no celebration
Burning contagious everywhere
Fight because it's time
There is no failure when you give it all
There is no worthy trophy
There is no celebration
Fight because it's time
There is no failure when you give it all
There is no failure when you give it all
Fight because it's time
It may be a silly thing
But I need you to hold me
When you're not around me
It may be an insanity
But I need you to guide me
Every time you're not here
A silver lightning on the road
You are my get up and go
You got me out of control
You are my get up and go
There must be a middle ground
But I don't even know where
There must be a dangerous storm
The world war I come from
The place where I belong
You are my get up and go
You got me out of control
You are my get up and go
I'm the one I ever do that out
I never hurt no one for who they are
I don't need to be you
I don't need to be you
I never hurt no one for who they are
I don't need to be you
I don't need to be you
I never hurt no one for who they are
I don't need to be you
How beautiful to sight
Those beams of morning play
How heaven laughs out with glee
Up from the eastern sea
Soars the delightful day
Today I shall be strong
No more shall yield to wrong
Shall squander life no more
I shall retrieve them now
Now I shall keep the vow
Past touch and sight and sound
Not further to be found
How hopeless under ground
You have left my life but I am sure
You'll never leave my heart
Now I know as the years go by
Each time I see the sky
You live in me every single day
And I'm with you once again
Each time I see the sky
You live in me every single day
Every night as I close my eyes you'll reappear
There are no words to say
Try to fight this feeling
You live in me every single day
Every night as I close my eyes you'll reappear
In the morning when I wake I'm so thankful for another day
Got my strength and I got my health you can't buy that with fame or wealth
I get overwhelmed with thankfulness for things I have received
And I just wanna testify
And I just wanna testify
And I just wanna testify
And I just wanna testify
And I just wanna plant the seeds and testify
Lift your voice up to the sky
Come on join in and don't be shy
Get on your feet and testify
Lift your voice up to the sky
We forgot all our promises
And only keep some of the easiest
However small the possibility
But sometimes tripped up by reality
Having come the long way round
I am closer closer than before
Here and now is all that it's about
Let's use it or we'll lose it
They will all say the same everyone
We are part of a chain
We could live our life from history
But there's no future in a memory
Having come the long way round
I am closer closer than before
Here and now is all that it's about
Let's use it or we'll lose it
They will all say the same everyone
We are part of a chain
They will all say the same everyone
We are part of a chain
They will all say the same everyone
How well I know this feeling
Seems that you will never learn
It can't go on forever
But very soon the tide will turn
When it won't go away
And no one else can cover you
I'll shelter you from thunder
When danger is around
I'll never let you down down down
If you play with fire
You're gonna get your fingers burned
Now the stakes are higher
Remember what it was we learned
When it won't go away
And no one else can cover you
I'll shelter you from thunder
I'll always be around
When the sky is falling down down down
Everyday I'm getting stronger
On a wave of hope that's going round
There's another world inside my heart
It's not impossible to turn it inside out
When it won't go away
And no one else can cover you
I'll shelter you from thunder
When danger is around
I'll never let you down down down
I'll always be around
It's hard for me to stop my heart
Love never knows when the time is right
I don't want to hurt anybody
I never felt like this before
I know this is special worth waiting for
Let life takes it course
That's the only thing for us to do
We've got time and baby there's no rush
Gonna be a better day for us
Hang on and I will wait for you
Our love will always stay as good as new
How can is stop my heart
Love never knows when the time is right
I don't wanna hurt anybody
Don't want to make them cry
We've got time and baby there's no rush
Gonna be a better day for us
Hang on and I will wait for you
Our love will always stay as good as new
Just a matter of time...
We've got time and baby there's no rush
Gonna be a better day for us
If I counted all the times
You are as sure as me
I'd give you up for someone else
When you change your tune
What am I to do with you
Don't love and ignore me
When you show the other side
It warms the heart of me
When you change your tune
What am I to do with you
Don't love and ignore me
When you change your tune
Once upon a time it was for real
And I couldn't ask for more
You were nearest to my heart
I can't make you love me anymore
Nothing matters now when you are gone
Tried so many times before
Only now I understand
We never felt the same
But I don't mind I don't mind
A better combination won't be hard to find
Got to learn to walk again
Start the life of different kind
I know this empty room too well
I've got to plan my new life's resolutions
First of all I show you how I can survive
I never knew that I could laugh like this
So I don't mind I don't mind
A better combination won't be hard to find
Got to learn to walk again
Start the life of different kind
Got to learn to walk again
Start the life of different kind
Once upon a time it was for real
Nothing mattered then we were together
You were nearest to my heart
Only now I understand
We never felt the same
Your shoulder's where I sit
I am here your help at hand
A clear view from where I stand
I'll be there if you need me
I am your helping hand
My words you've heard them all before
It's only for the sake of love
It's gonna be a new day for you
The stars have played their part
The past is gone and done
Have more faith in love
The best is yet to come
Take time to think it out
Don't make a new mistake
I am here your help at hand
It's gonna be a new day for you
The stars have played their part
The past is gone and done
Have more faith in love
The best is yet to come
My words you've heard them all before
It's only for the sake of love
The stars have played their part
The past is gone and done
Have more faith in love
The best is yet to come
It's gonna be a new day for you
It's gonna be a new day for you
It's only here by popular demand
You'll find a villain
It is a tried and tested most successful billing
They're in the kitchen
They're in the bedroom
They bring the world inside the home
As we look inside their private lives
It's really me and you
We're watching on the tube
You'll be hooked so deep
A dairy dose of soap on the screen
This is prime time TV
As seen on prime time TV
You can't turn it off and walk away
The conflicting morals of a family business
Maybe that's the reason why it's so addictive
All the alibis and fake surprise
But even so like the ratings show
As seen on prime time TV
It's only here by popular demand
Is it just for entertainment for pleasure
So when it's over we're back to people
Just to prove that human touch can have no equal
As we look inside their private lives
It's really me and you
We're watching on the tube
You'll be hooked so deep
A dairy dose of soap on the screen
It's only here by popular demand
As seen on prime time TV
It's only here by popular demand
As seen on prime time TV
It's only here by popular demand
Nobody knows where she came from
With a voice as light as air
Nobody knows but no one cares
When she signs makes you dream a fairy tale
She can make you feel so nice
Still will break your heart
You'll feel lucky she was there
One note samba would never be the same
Where is she now the lovely girl
With the softest voices you ever heard
Her lonely heart is nothing new
She can make you feel so nice
Still will break your heart
You'll feel lucky she was there
One note samba would never be the same
You'll feel lucky she was there
One note samba would never be
Nobody knows where she came from
With a voice as light as air
Nobody knows but no one cares
Your voice that sounded soft and sweet
Your manners knocked me off my feet
Infatuation made me blind
Today I know you are someone else
Than the one I keep in my mind
So now you think I'm yours
And you don't have to try
Seems nothing I do is right
How dare you talk to me like that
If you're not careful I'll get mad
How dare you talk to me like that
Let this be a warning
You made me hope we'd live a dream
But now you make me want to scream
Poetic style turned into prose
This gentleman that once I knew
I wonder if it was really you
And you don't have to try
Seems nothing I do is right
How dare you talk to me like that
If you're not careful I'll get mad
How dare you talk to me like that
Let this be a warning
Now you think I'm yours
And you don't have to try
Seems nothing you do is right
How dare you talk to me like that
If you're not careful I'll get mad
How dare you talk to me like that
I'm sorry darling but
Couldn't live without you
Wouldn't do without you near me
I'm so happy where I am
But too much of a good thing
So let's leave this noisy town
And move out to tread on enchanted ground
I've got to get things ready
Don't delay it any longer
And find a little house in a valley
Where the sun's always smiling
A perfect place for you and me
Miles away Now you see the reason
Just imagine a great big world
Only waiting for us to discover it
I'm getting so impatient
Our life could be even better
In our little house in a valley
Where the sun's always smiling
Where we got some more space to breathe
When the world gets too much
So no one can find us there
Let's find a little house in a valley
Where the sun's always smiling
My neighbors are Jeff and Jill
Don't ask me to forgive and forget
You'd never understanding
Stop saying you'd like to explain
It's far far too late
Now I don't want to know
Your honesty only makes me laugh
You can't make me love you anymore
Now I've got to learn to be free
And it really doesn't worry me
It's something I know
Time to end it once and for all
You can give me something
Like I've never have before
To your charms I could surrender
If you do the right thing
I'm gonna love you even more
I don't say forget the lust
But my heart you must remember
Made me feel that you are getting near
Was my dream but now I've got you here
I've been waiting for you
Listen to me and everything is gonna be all right
You can give me something
Like I've never have before
To your charms I could surrender
If you do the right thing
I'm gonna love you even more
I don't say forget the lust
But my heart you must remember
It seems that my words still pass you by
There is more to me than meets the eye
I've been waiting for you
Listen to me and everything is gonna be all right
Oh baby let's stay together
There's no one I would rather
You can give me something
Like I've never have before
To your charms I could surrender
If you do the right thing
I'm gonna love you even more
I don't say forget the lust
But my heart you must remember
They say true love lasts forever
There will be waiting
We're cruising for bruising...
When I still love you
They say true love lasts forever
There will be waiting
We're cruising for bruising...
You know me well by now
There's more to be discovered
And Baby my good heart
Might improve your inner life
I don't try to be your mother
Strange as it may seem
I still believe wrong can turn to right
I'm always here for you
There's so much that we can do
Because no matter where we are going there together
There's no doubt we will get there in the end
And if we have to stop
Gonna wait through stormy weather
Looking out of the window
Can't believe what I see
Where was all this beauty when I loved you
From now on this is my world
Yes we lost but I don't hurt any more
I knew there must be more to life than this
Now is the time for me
I'm grateful you set me free
Baby one good turn deserves another
Now is the time for you
Pray our dreams come true
Could not see the world around me
But now I keep inside my heart a
There is no need to worry
I'll find my place in the sun
Times are changing so am I
I know that God will give me one more chance
Have to get to know my friends again
I never realized that it could be like this
And I've got so much love to give
Sitting there and feeling lonely
Had my blue eyes for you only
Suddenly you turned around and smiled at me
It wasn't my imagination
Had no doubts no hesitation
When it comes to love I know where I wanna be
Is it real am I dreaming
I've been waiting light years for someone like you
Can't believe you are here with me
I've got you and I can't hide it anymore
I want the world to know that
You are blowing my mind
Baby you're really mine
Now I see what I've been missing
It's the happiest girl you're kissing
But when not dreaming
She thinks her world will fall apart
There's no one there to love her
And quench this burning passion
Sometimes frightened a little
Hiding our secret hopes
Want an ordinary love
What's going through her mind
How lonely is her life
Through other people's eyes
We might understand each other's hearts
But the crowd around him believes he has the power
Yet for his dreams no one cares
Sometimes frightened a little
Hiding our secret hopes
Want an ordinary love
Father I didn't really know you
Mother you are so very far away from me
Hopeless birthdays made me cry
Obviously that's how it was meant toe
There was a reason for it all
And I am not lonely anymore
That's why I am loved
You are everything I need
You are the sun the air I breathe
And if you go then don't forget to take me with you
The love that I gave was used against me
Maybe I just don't understand
Even friends failed to make me feel at home
There was a reason for it all
And I am not lonely anymore
That's why I am loved
Though you don't call anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess I'll rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I want to tell you Baby
The changes I've been going through
Till you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do
Why did you have to decide
You had to set me free
I'm gonna swallow my pride
Just to prove that my love is true
Till you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do
Living for you my dear
Is like living in a world of constant fear
That our love is dying
Although your phone you ignore
Somehow I must explain
I'm gonna rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I'm gonna camp on your step
Until I get through to you
I've got to change your view baby
Till you come back to me
This is a song about the place I come from
It's not on the moon at all
Where people's hearts are filled with passion
In my land of great romantics
I'm the biggest dreamer of them all
No way to stop their desire to change
And to improve our world
One invented Esperanto
Ready to move and to try something new
I'm convinced that Chopin too
Would dig samba if he had a chance to groove
That I only know very few simple words of your language
I've cracked it I've decided
Because the only words we need to communicate
Are the ones that can help me say
And that make me understand you love me too
Our love will take this globe by storm
People want to love and be loved
There's so much we don't know
So you might get a better picture
I don't claim I'm Curie or Copernicus
Now take me to heaven
But our love is not taboo
It was a dream before
With you I feel the Earth move
Get to know my other side
I kept the best for you
Baby you might be surprised
I'm grown up I'm not shy
I have waited long enough
It's time to stop lying
When he looks at me he's dreaming of your eyes
He was never truly happy in my arms
Ignore what people say and listen to your heart
Someone up there knows it is only your silly pride
Maybe that's the best thing that ever happened to you
Sail against the wind
Don't say it's not right
Just a mention of your name
Don't waste time Rachel
I've got a friend who had a schoolboy dream
He wanted every luxury that money could bring
He fancied himself as a King of the castle
Impressing all the ladies with the size of his car
But none of them would have it
They left the morning after
As a giver of love he was a walking disaster
Who will ever know of this charade
Unless you tell us who you really are
Down a road that's paved with gold but takes away your soul
Keep your heart out of sight
Then one night he met a beautiful girl
But he ran out of small talk and started to panic
The comedy was turning into something tragic
Never mix business with pleasure
You can play them independently but never together
Who will ever know of this charade
Unless you tell us who you really are
Down a road that's paved with gold but takes away your soul
Keep your heart out of sight
I can't stand by and let you ruin it
We've come so far to be turned down now
To be certain isn't easy anyway
You've got to find out for yourself
I can't stand by and let you ruin it
We've come so far to be turned down now
To be certain isn't easy anyway
Oh baby you only have to try it once
Now or never may be forever
Only now we could be together
No time for being clever
Gonna stay with you whatever
Baby it's now or never
I was dreaming when I jumped the lights
Busy scaling dizzy heights
Hummed a somewhat strangely familiar tune
My eyes as wide as open books
And from my ears upon two hooks
A big smile was hanging there like a crescent moon
It sometimes comes as quite a shock
When the gods of love decide to knock
You're in a state of disarray
Just when you least expect it
You'll never know a better day
Day dreaming fever taking over
No misdemeanor stone cold sober
The officer who stopped me said
And he guessed that I was over and above
I hoped he'd only caution me
And I made a plea for clemency
On the grounds that I was only drunk on love
It sometimes comes as quite a shock
When the gods of love decide to knock
You're in a state of disarray
Just when you least expect it
You'll never know a better day
Day dreaming fever taking over
First one it's a shock
A second helping not good enough
If you have any doubts then try once more...
Maybe I was too impressed...
He flattered I was blushing
Could I ever live up to his dreams
I have my plans and brave ambition
So next time I'll get closer
First one it's a shock
A second helping not good enough
If you have any doubts then try one more time
Later I met a boy whose inner life was his true passion
We did connect in an exploratory fashion
He claimed what tie us to this mortal coil we should sever
Could I ever live up to his dreams
I have my plans and brave ambition
Tender feelings heal with flowers
When your woes and sorrows leave you overwhelmed
For the state of endless sadness or uncompleted mourning
Some sunshine wattle revives all lost hopes
But for a simple case of longing
Some of us take daring chances following our lovers
The passion we can trust...
Others just cannot sit still
They're driven by the power of mighty wanderlust
To make every place feel like home left behind
We're homeless in our hearts...
But I'm yearning no more
And now it's where I belong
I gave up the world to be with you
The aim of our desire is hard to recognize
It often stares you in the face
Takes the longest time to find
What's the use of distant travel if only to discover
But I'm yearning no more
And now it's where I belong
I gave up the world to be with you
She deserves it and can't get used to so much joy
But hopes that she deserves it
Can't believe there's so much love around her now
It wasn't always there
She wouldn't even dare to think it
It leaves a little doubt in her gentle heart
She deserves it and can't get used to so much joy
But hopes that she deserves it
Can't believe there's so much love around her now
Not in her wildest dreams
One day there'll be not trace of sadness
But only fearless faith in her gentle heart
She wouldn't even dare to think it
One day there'll be no trace of sadness
This time I wanted this to be true
A silly polish girl in nice
There's always something to improve
There's always something to improve
So when you're in the south of France
Look for some magic gardens with olive trees
This time I wanted this to be true
Some olive branch must have heard my desperate heart
And the cup that once appeared half empty
Has become a cup that is half full
Where there was a space there is now plenty
Love is the sweetest illusion
Love is the sweetest illusion
Every innuendo seems to be in semaphore
Every dead end street's an ocean boulevard
The more I look the more I see
And I don't mind if my senses are deceiving me
The more I touch the more I feel
Who cares what is imaginary and what is real
If black is white and red is green
I don't care which way around it is supposed to be
I close my eyes but I can see...
The more I look the more I see
From where I stand my world is looking good to me
The more I touch the more I feel
In her mind there's no doubt
Though no one could show her how
Hers is gonna be a perfect baby
Cuddle it daily and smother with kisses
Just make sure that she never misses
No one could ever show her how
That's how it's always been and always will be
Deep down inside you never stop wishing
For the hope to be certain
That your boy or girl will be forever needing you
Hers is gonna be a perfect baby
Cuddle it daily and smother with kisses
You're the one that I ran to
All the loving you gave me
Left while we were sleeping
We're praying come back love
We still burn more fire than flame
You're the stop that I came to
The good time station
With no regulation and no masquerade
All you have aroused in me is my suspicion
You have been good for me
You deserve more credit
So won't you come back love
You don't have to be so strong
Don't move mountains for me
Every time you run back here
Who would need a prince
Anyway I don't believe in fairy tales
Let's leave them for the dreamers
There is something much more real I'm after
So simple joy is here to last
Very night and day I will long for the warmth
So who would need a prince
Anyway I don't believe in fairy tales
Let's leave them for the dreamers
There is something much more real I'm after
Last night I lost my mind and came so close to losing you
So close to losing you
Ignored the pleading voice and every sigh
Even your words of love I would not listen
It's a lesson I'll never forget
No communication gave rise to fear
I'd die if something would...
That only now I recognize some of my cruel ways
Some of my cruel ways
There was no other way you could get through
Now it's my turn to get through to you baby...
It's a lesson I'll never forget
No communication gave rise to fear
And I would die if something happened to you
I'd die if something would...
And I would die if something happened to you
I'd die if something would...
So close to losing you...
When I look around it makes me wonder
Am I worthy of the most amazing life that I've
Did not care before but I'm older
I see things in a different light
My grateful thoughts I raise to heaven
Thank you for letting me dream and hope
Thank you for this man who's always been true
And I do know that I'm lucky to be this strong
When I walk the streets it makes me wonder
Am I deserving of the most amazing home
All the cardboard boxes are much colder
And when I watch our children grow
My grateful thoughts I raise to heaven
Guide me and help me to carry on
I am eternally thankful for what I have
And if anything goes wrong
Then I still have you
This is a song about the place I come from
It's not on the moon at all
Where people's hearts are filled with passion
In my land of great romantics
I'm the biggest dreamer of them all
No way to stop their desire to change
And to improve our world

People want to love and be loved
There's so much we don't know
So you might get a better picture
I don't claim I'm Curie or Copernicus
They say true love lasts forever
There will be waiting
We're cruising for bruising...
When I still love you
They say true love lasts forever
There will be waiting
We're cruising for bruising...

You're in a state of disarray
Just when you least expect it
You'll never know a better day
Day dreaming fever taking over
Once upon a time it was for real
And I couldn't ask for more
You were nearest to my heart
I can't make you love me anymore
Nothing matters now when you are gone
Tried so many times before
Only now I understand
We never felt the same
But I don't mind I don't mind
A better combination won't be hard to find
Got to learn to walk again
Start the life of different kind
I know this empty room too well
I've got to plan my new life's resolutions
First of all I show you how I can survive
I never knew that I could laugh like this
So I don't mind I don't mind
A better combination won't be hard to find
Got to learn to walk again
Start the life of different kind
Got to learn to walk again
Start the life of different kind
Once upon a time it was for real
Nothing mattered then we were together
You were nearest to my heart

It's time to stop lying
When he looks at me he's dreaming of your eyes
He was never truly happy in my arms
Ignore what people say and listen to your heart
Someone up there knows it is only your silly pride
Maybe that's the best thing that ever happened to you
Sail against the wind
Don't say it's not right
Just a mention of your name
Don't waste time Rachel
Your shoulder's where I sit
I am here your help at hand
A clear view from where I stand
I'll be there if you need me
I am your helping hand
My words you've heard them all before
It's only for the sake of love
It's gonna be a new day for you
The stars have played their part
The past is gone and done
Have more faith in love
The best is yet to come
Take time to think it out
Don't make a new mistake
I am here your help at hand
It's gonna be a new day for you
The stars have played their part
The past is gone and done
Have more faith in love
The best is yet to come
My words you've heard them all before
It's only for the sake of love
The stars have played their part
The past is gone and done
Have more faith in love
The best is yet to come
It's gonna be a new day for you
It's gonna be a new day for you
We forgot all our promises
And only keep some of the easiest
However small the possibility
But sometimes tripped up by reality
Having come the long way round
I am closer closer than before
Here and now is all that it's about
Let's use it or we'll lose it
They will all say the same everyone
We are part of a chain
We could live our life from history
But there's no future in a memory
Having come the long way round
I am closer closer than before
Here and now is all that it's about
Let's use it or we'll lose it
They will all say the same everyone
We are part of a chain
They will all say the same everyone
We are part of a chain
They will all say the same everyone
It's hard for me to stop my heart
Love never knows when the time is right
I don't want to hurt anybody
I never felt like this before
I know this is special worth waiting for
Let life takes it course
That's the only thing for us to do
We've got time and baby there's no rush
Gonna be a better day for us
Hang on and I will wait for you
Our love will always stay as good as new
How can is stop my heart
Love never knows when the time is right
I don't wanna hurt anybody
Don't want to make them cry
We've got time and baby there's no rush
Gonna be a better day for us
Hang on and I will wait for you
Our love will always stay as good as new
Just a matter of time...
We've got time and baby there's no rush
Gonna be a better day for us
When all the love has slipped away
When every dream just fades away
Every explanation we can find
Father I didn't really know you
Mother you are so very far away from me
Hopeless birthdays made me cry
Obviously that's how it was meant toe
There was a reason for it all
And I am not lonely anymore
That's why I am loved
You are everything I need
You are the sun the air I breathe
And if you go then don't forget to take me with you
The love that I gave was used against me
Maybe I just don't understand
Even friends failed to make me feel at home
There was a reason for it all
And I am not lonely anymore
That's why I am loved
Though you don't call anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess I'll rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I want to tell you Baby
The changes I've been going through
Till you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do
Why did you have to decide
You had to set me free
I'm gonna swallow my pride
Just to prove that my love is true
Till you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do
Living for you my dear
Is like living in a world of constant fear
That our love is dying
Although your phone you ignore
Somehow I must explain
I'm gonna rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I'm gonna camp on your step
Until I get through to you
I've got to change your view baby
Till you come back to me
Looking out of the window
Can't believe what I see
Where was all this beauty when I loved you
From now on this is my world
Yes we lost but I don't hurt any more
I knew there must be more to life than this
Now is the time for me
I'm grateful you set me free
Baby one good turn deserves another
Now is the time for you
Pray our dreams come true
Could not see the world around me
But now I keep inside my heart a
There is no need to worry
I'll find my place in the sun
Times are changing so am I
I know that God will give me one more chance
Have to get to know my friends again
I never realized that it could be like this
And I've got so much love to give
I can only imagine how this could be like having beside me someone like you
It doesn't pay to be careful when my starving heart is on the line
You don't want to miss the best thing in your life
I can only dream how this must be like having with me someone exactly like you
It doesn't pay to be careful when my starving heart is on the line
You don't want to miss the best thing in your life
Instead I'll risk my pride
There is always someone there for everyone
Forget you know this language well
You cannot hide away from love
This could be a revolution
This could be love's resurrection
There is someone there for you who doesn't mind
Dreams enormous dreams
And one who dares enough to live again
This could be revolution
This could be love's resurrection
In how many ways can I still prove that I love you
In spite of all the crazy tests that you had put me through
How else am I to show you that I forgive you
For countless indiscretions performed in style by you
How many times you hope that I would ignore it
When you commit another crime and kick my love to death
And you'll be crying after someone who knew you well
I still believe although I'm losing my patience
Now I see that things will have to...
Things will have to change right now
What happened to your grand designs
It's not too late to fix your life
And I will admit to the crime
That you'll always be on my side
I take it for granted
I know you don't have to be here
You don't have to love me
Befriended by panic and cold
Again I appear to be strong
That's what they say...
I know you don't have to love me and be here
I take it for granted and...
How can I forget your love is a gift
Tell me where you're going
Is it thirst that drives you
Is it love you're looking for
There must be more to life than this
Not now but one day you'll discover
One special place that you came from
The grass is greener over there
Go after your wandering star
Everybody's on the move
Many different reasons
Make people leave it all behind
Some look for excitement
Others take risks to survive
Let's forget the cynics
Doubting the motives of us all
Nobody knows what you desire
No one but you knows what it feels right
We will get there anyway
To try for a better life
I wonder if you'll ever know
That every day I miss you so
Was I wrong to let you go
Or maybe you feel just like I do
And wonder if I'll ever know
That every day you miss me so
Why did we let it all fall apart
Before it even had a chance to start
There's a tear in my eye
There'll never be a better time
It all started with a dream
Then it seemed a hopeless scheme
Now I think what could have been
You took my panic for indifference
But how was I supposed to know
That one day I will miss you so
I would have fought for you to the end
I would have never let you slip away
Now there's a tear in my eye
There'll never be a better time
You'll look at me again
And maybe you will find someone to love
So why day by day and night by night I play a waiting game
You keep on loving me and I still keep on wishing
And the summer makes my world turn upside down
When you're feeling lost and lonely
And when people treat you coldly
When you think there's nothing up there
When a doubt becomes a nightmare
You can escape this place
You can forget this place
They'll take you to their hearts
I will always remember my two islands with love
They will never grow old
When your road is going sideways
When you swim against the current
And your arms are getting tired
You can escape this place
You can forget this place
I will always remember my two islands with love
They will never grow old
They came to us for a reason
Leaving memories we can lean on
One day if I go to heaven
We will be again together
When there's no other like this one
It's highly suspicious
There must be a motive
No one's that stupid and altruistic
There is no reason to go on
Waste away or die of disappointment
Those you love the most inflict the deepest cut
Waste away or die of disappointment
One you love the most will surely break your heart
Again your love lies bleeding
But your heart's still breathing
So your love lies bleeding
But your heart's still breathing
And it tears you apart
There is no other like this one
It's nothing suspicious
I don't have any motive
I must be stupid and altruistic
To love so deeply and so completely
There is no reason to go on
There's no cloud on your horizon
It will make us stronger
God only knows how hard we try
A different ball game
But we are winners today
It's the way that we play
It's the way that we play the game
It's the way that we play
It's the way that we play the game
Show what you're made of
Learn to fight against all odds
And prove you can survive
Hold your faith undaunted
Now and then a perfect match
Right from the start there was none who had faith in us
Who believed two of us had a chance
They don't know about us
They know nothing about us
They don't understand
They know nothing about us
They don't know about us
They know nothing about us
They don't get our love
Wish we could be somewhere else
Where they wish us well
Where the people are happy for us
Just imagine how far we could go
But why is she looking so pleased
After all that has happened
And yet she has the time of her life
To welcome bad weather
She's demanding too much
Preaching how to love
But has the time of her life
To welcome bad weather
She's demanding too much
She welcomes bad weather
These times are different
This world can thrill and scare you too
Don't try to fight me
Under the wings of mother's love
That's where I want you
I'd like to be there too
Yet there's winter in her heart
You could never love another
For the love you cannot live without
All you need is a clear horizon
A clear and quiet sky
The darkest night is slowly fading
And the sun will come out to blind your eyes
There is a day when the angels blush
So overjoyed with the world they see
They finally rest for awhile
Observing the Earth in glee
And there is warmth despite December
Our little games we can't remember
There's so much more that matters today
If only we could live like this everyday of the year
In the Christmas glow of love
Must be divine intervention
Of hearts under heaven's spell
And there is warmth despite December
Our little games we can't remember
There is much more that matters today
If only we could live like this everyday of the year
In the Christmas glow of love
There is a day when the angels blush
So overjoyed with the world they see
They finally rest for awhile
Observing the Earth in glee
In the Christmas glow of love
I'm through with love
I'm finished with this
This moment was never my joy
Who needs a heart break
Don't want anybody to call my own
The sweetest sensation
I feel like I'm losing control
These moments of weakness
Allow me a glimpse of heaven
But I've been so strong
It's like a mystery too soulful
For you broke my resolve
Now I'm fighting I try
That I could really go for you
Now I'm fighting I try
That I could really go for you
I'm through with love
I'm finished with this
This moment was never my joy
Who needs a heart break
Don't want anybody to call my own
The sweetest sensation
I feel like I'm losing control
These moments of weakness
Allow me a glimpse of heaven
I'm looking for clues
I take leave of my senses
Give back all defenses
That I could really go for you
That I could really go for you
Or why should I resent something I've always missed
What's the point in my pride
That I could really go for you
What's the point in my pride
That I could really go for you
I'm through with love
I'm finished with this
This moment was never my joy
Who needs a heart break
Don't want anybody to call my own
The sweetest sensation
I feel like I'm losing control
These moments of weakness
Allow me a glimpse of heaven
I'm through with love
I'm finished with this
This moment was never my joy
Who needs a heart break
Don't want anybody to call my own
The sweetest sensation
I feel like I'm losing control
These moments of weakness
Allow me a glimpse of heaven
I'm through with love
I'm finished with this
This moment was never my joy
Who needs a heart break
Don't want anybody to call my own
The sweetest sensation
I feel like I'm losing control
These moments of weakness
With flowers in her hair
To warm the winter's end
Melts the frozen ground
Take off the layers of maturity
Learn to skip and laugh
Melts the frozen heart
Take off the layers of maturity
And the river bank talks of the waters of March
A truckload of bricks in the soft morning light
A shot of a gun in the dead of the night
And the river bank talks of the waters of March
And the river bank talks of the waters of March
And the river bank talks of the waters of March
And the river bank talks of the waters of March
And the river bank talks of the waters of March
She was looking so damn fine
It was all about party time
When the sun went down
It was boom boom boom
When she walked the room
I know it's hard to get her
She could kiss a lucky girl
She could rock your world
I never felt like this before
She took me closer to heave
It was boom boom boom
When she walked the room
I know it's hard to get her
Now tell me what I gotta do
Just give that little clue
Now I'm just feeling blue
Now I see I made a mistake
I often dream that you're here with me
So I'm here alone on the phone
I need you girl to rescue me
I need you girl to rescue me
Everyone around says forget about you
But I keep holding on
That maybe someday you walk back in my life
I never meant to throw your love away
Tell me what to do to get you back
I need you girl to rescue me
I need you girl to rescue me
I need you baby to come and save me
I need you girl to rescue me
I need you girl to rescue me
I need you girl to rescue me
Just call my name and I'll be right there
Whatever you need I got it guaranteed
Boy your love is something
Feel this love jumping
Ooh you keep me coming
Anytime you want me baby
Anything you want now baby you know that I'll be there.

The night we met I knew I needed you so
And if I had just one chance I'd never let you go
So won't you say you love me
I'll make you so proud of me
I'll make them turn their heads every place we go
Oh since the day I saw you
You know I've been waiting for you
You know I'll wait for you Till eternity
I used to sing to you
We used to kiss hello
And then we said goodbye
And made each other cry
Remember all the little things
I wonder why we ever had to say goodbye
We used to sing along
The sparkle in your eyes
Was like the starry skies
To the beat of the drum
And the band began to play
Remember all the little things
Gonna dance with my baby till the night is through
Tell her all the little things I'm gonna do
And I'm here waiting for you.
But what else can I do.
What some people will do.
But you're not there to see.
What some people will do.
If I got on my knees and I pleaded with you
If I called out your name like a prayer in the night
You took me away from the rest of the world
When you taught me to love you like this
Now I hang by a thread in the canyon of doom
But I still can be saved... by your kiss
If I got on my knees and I pleaded with you
Looks like an angel dances like a devil
Half a child see her more just drives me wild
You better watch out baby
She don't care she'll just dance on
Jenny Jenny gotta dance just look at her dance.
Looks like an angel dances like a devil
Look at the way she can pout with her lips now
And when I see her it makes me crying.
And that she call I'm
My baby and when she call.

My baby's gone and I feel through.
This time she passage by
Makes me feel so bad.

The way I just to do.
My baby and when she call.
My baby I maybe kiss.
My baby's gone and I feel through.
You know to see my baby goodbye.
It makes me break don't cry.
You know my baby ever comes home.
My baby and when she call.
My baby I maybe kiss.
My baby's gone and I feel through.
The summer sun sitting high in the sky
And love that's in everyone's eye
You feel loose and get out in the sun
Summer's here and we're gonna have fun
Two weeks are past and at last
We can really feel free
And you can run in the sun
Walk in the sand hand in hand
With the boy that you met on vacation
And on a warm summer night it's all right
And you're right on the down of the sea
On the beach where the gang's gonna be
We can stay there all day
Until the fall is over over over
In the evening he's waiting for you
And you go to the beach barbecue
Ready for that good old rock and roll.
I wanna see a happy congregation dancing to the groovy sound
Ready for that rock and roll
We're just bringing back the good times
Making our music our very own way
Just brining back the good times
Come along with us now

Nobody asks us if it's right or wrong
Doing what has to be done
Bringing back the good times.

Now that you've gone away
I've got so much to say
I'm gonna kiss you now
Tell you I'll miss you now
We knew it couldn't last
But now the time has past
You've got to disappear
Gone for another year
How can we meet again
I don't know whether we'll
Now that we've broken up
I think of how you cared
And of the things we shared
How can we meet again
I don't know whether we'll
Now that we've broken up
I think of how you cared
And of the things we shared
The going was tough but it was gonna get rougher
As he rallied that motor right into the night
He's still ahead but his arms are like lead
And his eyes are so heavy that he's nearly blind.
If you hate me after what I say
Can't pull it off any longer
Just gotta tell her anyway
You're the one girl in town I'd marry
Wish I never had known you better
Wish I knew you before I met her
Should have told her that I can't linger
There's a wedding ring on my finger

In their eyes you'll always be a star
Remember those were the days

The times have changed so fast
Now memories and Norma Jean blues in the night
Whoa oh don't let it bring you down
You made them laugh you made them cry you know
Oh you dream of a silver stallion
Riding high on the stars above
And then a ray of love comes and carries you away
Then you dream of a thousand faces
Watching you on a silver screen
And then the morning comes
Chasing all your dreams away
Oh you dream of a deep blue ocean
On the shores of the seven seas
And then you sail the wind
Gliding on a silver wave
And you dream of a golden city
In the land of a prince so fair
And then the eyes of love turn into another day
Till then my teenage heart will wait for you.
My teenage love will still be true.

Till I come to see you again
And I know that you are in my heart
Doesn't matter where I go
You'll always be there
And it happened when at first we said hello
If in time without a reason you want to know
If I'm not always around to show
That if you were not to wait for me
There's nowhere I can go
Anyone to look at me the way that you do
Seeing through your eyes
All the good things that happen to me
And don't you worry if I turn away
It will only have to wait until the next time
When I come back to the love you save for me
When you close your eyes
And it happened when at first we said hello
Gonna dance with my baby till the night is through

Hear their engines scream
You better run and hide

You better run and hide
Find the one you love
Eagles fly in the morning sun

Giving I can't afford a crown
These tears that words are
Make me wanna be with you
But I need to spend my body
And no page can release it
Like this amplifier can
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
God I must be crazy to express myself this way
And electricity's a devil with a twenty amp fuse
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
In a man's genetic code
Till my genes explode
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
Maybe I'm a fool to love you
Baby I'm a fool to need you
Maybe I'm a fool to love you
Baby I'm a fool to want you
Baby please don't bring me down
Maybe I'm a fool to think you really care
Maybe I'm a fool to think you always will be there
I told you that I love you so
Maybe I'm a fool to love you
Baby I'm a fool to need you
Maybe I'm a fool to love you
Baby I'm a fool to want you
If dreams are what they say
Just nothing more than wishing
Then one day you will be mine
Knocking on your door
Can I love you any more
Maybe I'm a fool to think you really care
Maybe I'm a fool to think you always will be there
I told you that I love you so
Maybe I'm a fool to think you really care
Maybe I'm a fool to think you always will be there
I told you that I love you so
Maybe I'm a fool to love you
Baby I'm a fool to need you
Maybe I'm a fool to love you
Baby I'm a fool to want you
Wouldn't you like to come and spin me
Wouldn't you like it lets spend the night together.
We'd be alone and we could turn the
Just you and me and we could take it
Come on I won't let go.
Wouldn't you like it lets spend the night together.
Wouldn't you like it lets spend the night together.
Sail across horizons as the ocean sails towards the Eastern Sun
Then a voice called out for love and I was gone
Like a child yeah I was hooked on love
Those Eastern eyes were made to torment a guy
Like a child yeah I was hooked on love
Like a child yeah I was hooked on love
I don't wanna lose her
I just want to stay here tonight
So don't stop the music
I will surely break down.
So don't stop the music
I don't ever wanna say goodbye
That I really love her
And though we just met here tonight
It all feels so right
Oh please can't you see
I don't wanna lose her
So don't stop the music
I don't ever wanna say goodbye.
That I could hold her
Though many times I tried
I would see that look in her eyes
Here comes the Disco Kid.
They call the Disco Kid.
Here comes the Disco Kid.
They call the Disco Kid.
Here comes the Disco Kid.
They call the Disco Kid.
They call the Disco Kid
Eagles come riding in the morning light
You better run and hide
Find the one you love
Eagles fly in the morning sun
Eagles fly in the midday sun
Hear their engines scream
You better run and hide
When the morning comes
You better run and hide
Find the one you love
Eagles fly in the morning sun
Eagles fly in the midday sun
Wishing you were here beside me
That's the way it ought to be
You know we could run away
Baby let's pretend that tonight we'll live forever
If we close our eyes and believe it might come true
Baby let's pretend we could always be together
But for now just let me spend the night with you
Things are gonna be so different
So now that we're all alone
Baby let's pretend that tonight we'll live forever
If we close our eyes and believe it might come true
Baby let's pretend we could always be together
But for now just let me spend the night with you
Things are gonna be so different
So now that we're all alone
Baby let's pretend that tonight we'll live forever
If we close our eyes and believe it might come true
Baby let's pretend we could always be together
But for now just let me spend the night with you
Things are gonna be so different
So now that we're all alone
Baby it's good to see your face again
It's been some time I've missed you so
Those lonely years go by and look how much you've changed
And you know what love is for
You say you don't need me you're not a little girl anymore
Oh you're a woman I can see it in your eyes
So I'll turn and walk out through the door
Can't stand to hear your woman lies no more.
Those lonely nights I'd lie and think of you
I know that I was wrong
And look how much I've changed
And you know what love is for
I get my kicks from rock and roll
A 12 bar boogie gonna bless my soul
Wanna dance to that rhythm
I don't wanna play no heavy jazz
With high class music
And its stuffed shirt nights
And rock the night away
And rock the night away
I don't wanna play no Memphis soul
Make my name in the headline news
I'll play my music just as fast as I can
Yes I'm a rock and roller
Well it's been building up inside of me for
When she looks in my eyes
Everything will turn out alright
I guess I should have kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back out now because
I pushed the other guys too far
She makes me come alive
And makes me want to ride
Everything will turn out alright
I guess I should have kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back out now because
I pushed the other guys too far
She makes me come alive
And makes me want to ride
Take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I love you baby
Oh what she does to me
When she brings love to me
Everything will turn out alright
I guess I should have kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back out now because
I pushed the other guys too far
She makes me come alive
And makes me want to ride
See the people who stop and stare and say
Haven't I seen your face before
Is all that we're be gonna be
All that we'll be if we don't get together now.
I don't read the news
You ain't in my shoes
All that we'll be if we don't get together now.
My dreams are weak and falling into this
Where the pieces of this life we put together
Oh can't you see it in my eyes
All the words just seem so wrong
And like a picture you keep fading
Your colors running dry
Save the pieces of this life we put together.
Find a space for me and light
This corner of my lonely life
You're my lover and my friend
My future would be brighter if you'd only answer yes
And help me put these pieces back together
Can't you see it in my eyes
And won't you save a place for me tonight
Find a space for me and light this corner of my lonely life
Can't you see it in my eyes
Money can't make you turn your head now
Money can't get you into bed now
Can't give more than you get now
Living like a princess with a frown
Giving I can't afford a crown
These tears that words are
Make me wanna be with you
But I need to spend my body
And no page can release it
Like this amplifier can
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
God I must be crazy to express myself this way
And electricity's a devil with a twenty amp fuse

This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
I'm hoping you'll write a letter
I tried to make a call uh uh
And I gotta let you go
But there's on who needs to see you
And I've really gotta know
We're wasting all this time
But you don't want to know
Or stand his love I have inside
I'm trying to face it
This pain just seems to grow
And maybe try and see it my way
Are you still too young to know
We're wasting all this time
But you don't want to know
Or stand his love I have inside
I'm trying to face it
This pain just seems to grow
And maybe try and see it my way
Are you still too young to know
I just gotta let you go
I phoned the local station
I kinda like the things they're playing
So I settled down to listen nice and easy.
The DJ plays our kind of music
He's asked us folk to choose it
But it all adds up to another
And anyone who's feeling lonely
And make a little conversation
And in the night there's music playing
Soft behind the words he's saying
Would I like to make a dedication
This song I wanna dedicate to you
And to everyone who feels the way we do
As long as you're a part of me
The song will play on endlessly
I hope my dedication's getting through
I'm standing in this lonely city
There's not enough to keep me busy
And we can't meet till I can take
You'll never know how much I love you
Lying here thinking of you
And all I got is a late night music station
This song I wanna dedicate to you
And to everyone who feels the way we do
As long as you're a part of me
I hope my dedication's getting through
Dedication playing just for you.
This song I wanna dedicate to you

I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only know I never want to let you go
Ever since we met you've had a hold on me
It happens to be true
I only want to be with you
It doesn't matter where you go or what you do
I want to spend each moment of the day with you
Look what has happened with just one kiss
I never knew that I could be in love like this
It's crazy but it's true
I only want to be with you
You stopped you smiled at me
And asked me if I cared to dance
I fell into your open arms
I didn't stand a chance
I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together honey I don't care
Ever since we met you've had a hold on me
It's crazy but it's true
I only want to be with you
It's crazy but it's true
I only want be with you
You stopped you smiled at me
And asked me if I cared to dance

And if you knew how much I love you baby
Oh what she does to me
When she brings love to me
Everything will turn out alright
I guess I should have kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back out now because
I pushed the other guys too far
She makes me come alive
And makes me want to ride
You think you're a groove
But look like a clown
He's taking your place
Who's got a good face
But what's in his head
Might as well be lead
While he stood to look
I'm hoping you'll write a letter
I tried to make a call uh uh
And I gotta let you go
But there's on who needs to see you
And I've really gotta know
We're wasting all this time

It's crazy but it's true
Do you love me like I love you
Or is this good bye bye bye bye
I should have known better than to fall in love with you
Well I guess I'll spend my whole life loving you
One kiss so warm and tender one kiss and I surrender
My love to you forever more.
But do you love me like I love you baby
Say you'll always love me
And do you need me like I need you baby
You know that I'll always be in love with you.
Well I know true love will always have it's day
Your love can last forever
In love we'll be together
Sharing our love forever more.
But all the guys wanna meet her
She's a natural operator
She's a high class stimulator
There's a riot on the corner
Did we have to say goodbye
The clown came down to meet me
With a smile upon his face
He fired his starting pistol
And began the human race
There were faces all around me
They were running everywhere
But everywhere is nowhere
And nowhere isn't there
A game that we're playing
I don't mind but I don't make the rules
A game that we're playing
Just a game for lovers and fools
There's snakes upon your ladder
And there's dice upon your skirt
There's lipstick on my collar
And there's sweat upon my shirt
But you know that I don't care
And nowhere isn't there
I believed all love has gone
I've no strength to carry on
Thought my world was upside down
Then you walked on to my life
Went to work to set things right
What's the secret that you use
You made me believe in magic
You know that I can be true to your love
You made me believe in magic
Your love's put magic into my life
Now I'm filled with new sense to be
You gave my life harmony
Loving you is all I need
You made me believe in magic
You know that I can be true to your love
You made me believe in magic
Yesterday when I was young
I played the game and never won
Thought rock and roll would bless
Songs of love and ecstasy
Remind me how it used to be
I thought those days would never end
But now it seems I need a friend
I remember all those days gone by
I remember all their faces
The old familiar places
No our song could last forever
Don't let the music die
Don't let the music die
I played the clown and Pantomime
Or was it just a dream that's gone
Echoed voices from the past
Recall the songs I thought would last
And the love we share's the reason why
I remember all those days gone by
The old familiar places
No our song could last forever
Don't let the music die
Don't let the music die
When we were young we had our time
But now that it's over
All the songs sound out of rhyme
No our song could last forever
Don't let the music die
When I walk down the street
Don't have to care about who I meet
And it's the greatest power of them all
And I've this feeling I can conquer all
But my feet are always on the ground
People I believe the reason why is I've got
But my feet are always on the ground
Let me see you in the glow.
In the fire light you are shining...
If this love I feel will grow.
Let's take tonight to start out finding...
Everything will be all right.
I will keep your candle burning.
Open up your heart to me.
I can see your love light glowing.
Let us taste each other's wine.
Till the cup is overflowing...
Everything will be all right.
I will keep your candle burning.
Some kind of evil woman is bringing me down now
She don't understand what I say
She thinks it's a crime now
She give me love fever
She give me love fever
She give me love fever
She give me love fever
She give me love fever
She give me love fever
She shine like night into day she set me on fire
She give me love fever
She give me love fever
She give me love fever
But you never played the game
Her name was Jackie Brown
She cried when they told her
Old sweet Virginia town
You know it's not over
The jokers laughed and cried
I got the time you got the money she explained
But time was one thing now that Jackie couldn't spend
Turn the pages of a broken dream
Masquerading in a hyper dream
Fading shadows talk of their machine
Through the haze another cigarette
So much to say to forget
Inside a broken dream I cry
Inside an empty room I'll stare
At love that is not there
Life begins with your head in the dark
The chord of life reveals the final spark
Yea we've been strangers living in a wonderland
Seems you've been busy building castles in the sand
I heard the word you said inside my loving bed
And I've seen the scars I left inside your loving head
Inside my head I'm not the one you see
And if you think you can make it just remember to beware
That all in love is fair
The situation vacant now has got the blues
The obituary column's making front page news
Infatuation's got the better of you
And if you wanna know then what you gotta do
Inside my head I'm not the one you know
And if you think you can make it just remember to beware
Inside my head I'm not the one you know
And if you think you can make it just remember to beware
Got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe your hair's all right
Rebel rebel put on your dress
Rebel rebel how could they know
Hot tramp I love you so
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they play it hard
You want more and you want it fast
Rebel rebel put on your dress
Rebel rebel how could they know
Hot tramp I love you so
Hot tramp I love you so
You can't get enough but enough ain't the test
Transmission and live wire
You try a vibration and a handful of loot
You want a DJ when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
A voice on the early show says I'm not alone
It's just another rainy day in New York City
And the rain comes pouring down
Like early morning strangers we had nothing left to say but
And I think of the night when it all felt so right
It's another rainy day in New York City
At night those city lights they sure look pretty
I held my candle to the wind and watched my dreams just sail away
With another rainy day in New York City
To think that only yesterday
Life was such an easy game that I could play
Now it's another rainy day in New York City
And the rain comes pouring down
So I'm on my own and the radio says
That the sun ain't gonna shine
You know I can't find a way to get you out of my mind.
It's another rainy day in New York City
At night those city lights they sure look pretty
I held my candle to the wind and watched my dreams just sail away
With another rainy day in New York City
It's another rainy day in New York City
All of the world is falling in love
The sound of love is in the air
Think of the love that we have to give
The world as one and let live
For love is the reason
And now is the season
All of the world is falling in love
The sound of love is in the air
Look at the world that we call our own
The children sing out alone
All of the world is falling in love
They take me back to the place
All of the world is falling in love
The sound of love is in the air
All of the world is falling in love
All of the world is falling in love
All of the world is falling in love
We were gonna end up like this anyway
It just had to end sometime
Without the love you gave to me
You made those days a fantasy
You opened up the best of me
Without the love you gave to me
There is nothing left for me that can compare
With the kind of love that stripped me bare
Lord only knows what I'm gonna live for now
Without the love you gave to me
You made those days a fantasy
You opened up the best of me
Without the love you gave to me
Without the love you gave to me
You made those days a fantasy
You opened up the best of me
Without the love you gave to me
You've been high on love
I've been on my knees
I've been stuck in the middle
Now you know how it feels
I feel the sound of the beat
You know I'm down on the street
Yes I'm back on the street
I hear the music of the street
I've been wasting time
You've been chasing me
Now you're out of my mind
And I'm back on the street
Yes I'm back on the street
I feel the sound of the beat
You know I'm down on the street
Yes I'm back on the street
I hear the music of the street
Yes I'm back on the street
I feel the sound of the beat
You know I'm down on the street
Yes I'm back on the street
I'll see you down on the street
I feel the sound of the beat
Suitcase full of dreams
Trying to find some kind of memories
That didn't hold a distant scheme
Something she said I can't remember
But I answered her in turn all the same
And what I saw in her style
Well I'd seen it before
But somehow it looked quite different this time
Goodbye to all the friends I never had
Do you still remember me
And I wonder with all your broken dreams
If you ever knew me at all
But somehow you still look the same.
Say a prayer for the one you need
Too many here come back Saturday
There's too many words to say
Some things will never change
So many faces seemed to pass me by
I've had my share yes it's been used
I'd only laugh at you confused
What used to be an old apartment
And where the children would play
But the rooms are nice with numbers on the door
But in her eyes there's a place for me
An open heart where I can hide away
As life rearranges to something new
And will she wait for me
When all is said and done will she still be free
Or will the chance be lost
Fro love is so hard to take
When dreams in the night are blown away
In her hand lies an opened book
She gives a sign then she turns the page
And in her smile she knows how it all will end
But in my eyes she sees
It's not because your eyes say something to me
It's not because your smile flies me away
Really it's an ordinary day
But sunshine's shining through me
It seems you kinda did it to me
Love brought me such a magical thing
Love brought me such a magical thing
Love brought me such a magical thing
Love brought me such a magical thing
It's not the words you quietly whisper to me
The way you say them leaves them far behind
Sometimes it's so difficult to find
A way to tell you truly
It seems you kinda did it to me
Oh baby when I feel your touch
The magic in your fingers takes control of me
My love for you is way too much
Hold on to what we've got
Your loving takes me higher
Would you be my woman
Well baby when I saw you on that night
I had to put my loving spell on you
You were standing in the rain
But through the stormy weather all your love
Oh baby can't you see
A love like this was meant to be
Your loving takes me higher
Oh baby can't you see
A love like this was meant to be
Your loving takes me higher
Would you be my woman
There are times in my life
But you turned and walked out through the door
When every move I make
Is all for your loving sake
And every dream at night
Is all trying to keep it right
Baby the last goodbye
The lights all go down
Far away I can hear the last train
Makes me think of my home
And you waiting around
And I know that you feel just the same
Listen while I sing you a song
It used to make your mama cry
Lay down your sleepy head
This is what your mama said
Close your eyes and you will see
The Golden Age of Hollywood
The days of silver starlight in her eyes
Makes her young again
Even though she's very old
Rudy stole the heart of the world
Dream lover of the silver screen
Your mama used to call out his name
But in the crowd was never seen
Dancing girls in soft repose
The Golden Age of Hollywood
The days of silver starlight in her eyes
Makes her young again
Even thought she's very old
Always asking if you hear me
Now when I say I love you
Now it really means I love you
When I say I want you I can only give you pain
I can only bring you sorrow
I will always be the same
When I say I love you I can only speak your name
I can only take your number
If I ask you don't deny me one more time
Now when I say I love you
Now it really means I love you
There'll be many more to love you
All of the world is falling in love
The sound of love is in the air
Think of the love that we have to give
The world as one and let live
For love is the reason
And now is the season
All of the world is falling in love
The sound of love is in the air
Look at the world that we call our own
The children sing out alone
All of the world is falling in love
They take me back to the place
All of the world is falling in love
The sound of love is in the air
All of the world is falling in love
All of the world is falling in love
All of the world is falling in love
Ride up to the tenth floor where the mannequins are high
Taking their erection with your eye.
I had a dream when I started out
Get out of school and buy a guitar
I had a band with a thousand names
And people said that I was star.
I gotta get up on the stage
And get myself on the hit parade.
And it's the only thing that I understand
And now I've got someone to give me a hand.
Play in a rock and roll band.
The band rehearsed every day and night
And everything was coming on strong
Played Anaheim when the time was right
And all I had to play was this song.
And I could feel electricity
The lights so bright I could hardly see.
And it's the only thing that I understand
And now I've got someone to give me a hand.
Play in a rock and roll band.
It started out so long ago
A kid in school into rock and roll
You couldn't get it out of your head
You heard a voice and all it said was ...
You wanna rock and roll all night.
Playing in a rock and roll band
And it's the only thing that I understand
And now I've got someone to give me a hand.
Play in a rock and roll band
Play in a rock and roll band
That was a time to remember
When loving was free and all I could see
I've been out there on the road for some time now
No woman ever loved me like you do now.
Hello and welcome home
You bring me love so real
Love you like I always have
Hello and welcome home
The way I feel tonight I love you
But when you were gone like the end of a song
I was fading for you but all I could do was hold on
I thought of you as someone to confide in
And those nights alone were never something quite like this
Hello and welcome home
You bring me love so real
Love you like I always have
Hello and welcome home
You bring me love so real
Hello and welcome home
You bring me love so real
When I started out the band
I wasn't even a teenage man
You should have seen us standing by the gear
And the funny clothes we'd wear
Playing records by the score of other bands
We had started out to make it big
You should have seen our first gig
Now there was all of us at school
And we were fighting every rule
We were young and we won
And so the band began to play
And we were playing every day
And so soon we got a PA and what a day
And the drummer got his drums so he could play
We had started out to make it big
Another line and it's another show
Then off to London but I don't really care.
I hear the sound of the stoned houses
I hear the sound of the stoned houses
Feel the sound of the broken glass.
You pay your dues and that's all that you get
Some other crashed out suicide call
Some other mother with his back against the wall.
Just a quick exchange
Inside the sound of the stoned houses
Inside the sound of the stoned houses
Feel the sound of the broken glass.
It's just the sound of the broken glass
Make an early air ride then you crash your car
Tripping out on Sunday when you find you're a star
New York on Monday when your LA was fine
So you take another jet stream and get lost in your wine
Everybody wants to be somebody but nobody wants to give the time
Down the line East 65th Street on my mind
There's love in the air
It's just the price you have to pay
For your ride on Saturday
It's just the price you have to pay
Well standing on the corner when she catches your eye
Offers twenty twenty dollars for a twin it's on your mind
Everybody wants to give the time
There's loving in the air
The smoke gets in your eyes
It's only you in disguise
But it's the price you have to pay
There's loving in the air
It's just the price you have to pay
For your ride on Saturday
Some other red man turned another screw.
Some other poor boy watch him fade away.
It's all in the night of instant relay.
I'll love you forever
Every moment I'm in you
Each time we're together
Every thing you say or do.
Till the morning turns the day
Every movement that you make.
I'll love you forever
Driving around in a racing car
Talking on the telephone
Sitting in the back of a limousine
Driving to my plastic home.
Feeling down then get high and get higher.
Finally find a place in St. George's drive
But too far from the Hollywood Bowl
Got a meeting with the band at the office at one
But I put it down as rock and roll.
See a girl in a crowd and I love her.
Woman time drinking wine
Every night doing fine
Spend my life making out in a limousine
Checking out all the bars and the mezzanines
Won't someone throw me a line
Let me out let me make it this time
Another city but they all just look the same
Hand me down my backstage pass
Another gig and it's another blast
Pack my bags and I'm on my way
I'm working out on a twelve bar day
And it looks as if it ain't gonna end
And I think I've got a touch of the bends
Won't someone throw me a line
Back on the road again
Through all the years have passed you by
Your boy has gone out for the day
He tried to call on his anniversary.
And he wishes he could be with you this day.
And he wishes he could be with you this day
And the time is soon when you will pass this way.
Getting everybody together
We gotta get you down to the show
Yet they always say your music's too loud
But as long as we got the people
I'm trying hard to sleep in the open
With nothing else but guitars and mike
Have to find a job tomorrow
But you with all your cover of good love
I'm working for the people
I'm working for the people
I'm working for the people
I'm working for the people
I'm working for the people
I'm working for the people
I'm working for the people
I'm working for the people
I'm working for the people
I'm working for the people
I'm Working for the people
I'm working for the people
I'm working for the people
Did you walk down the imaginary lover
Were you there on the right down on the backstreet guys
So it's a left on the right side of the litter
It was last night in SOHO I was dancing
Last night in Soho you were there
Then the light comes down and you hear the sound
It was last night in Soho I was dancing
Last night in Soho I was dancing
Last night in Soho you were there
I don't care what you say
So you can take your choice
When my hands fall down you just turn around
And you take the blame you just play that game
It was last night in SOHO I was dancing
Last night in Soho you were there
Then the light goes down and you hear the sound
It was last night in Soho I was dancing
Last night in Soho you were there
Don't bring your troubles back to me
And I don't need your love
One man all the times
Doesn't give you the best of my love
The day the circus came to town
To find that their hero was the clown.
One man all the times
Doesn't give you the best of my love
The day the circus came to town
To find that their hero was the clown.
With just one answer I'd blow him away
So how's the weather boy
You look so cold there
They walk right through you now
You need some fresh air
Don't cut on me this time
What will you be if you're still alive
I always said that you could be some fashion
I always wanted you to take some action
For when I think of it and what you do there
I wish that I could change the time
And let you change some
What will you be if you're still alive
What will you be if you're still alive
Yes what I can tell you now
So I come to play the love in New York
Still said it was new to me
And it was good to be there
It was like a fantasy
Though I was in it going to California
So I packed my bags again
To see the warmer day than we had seen in New York
Like I'd come to stay
I met a friend of mine who took me on home
Driving till the other end
This lonely race that you're in
You're just a lonely rider looking for something to ride
After hitching a ride into Hollywood
Just to see the famous scene I understood
Spent the nights with the girl that I knew
I knew that I was getting to know
With all the things we knew
So I got into her and she got into me
I got a feeling that came right through to me
When that woman took me by the hand
Driving till the other end
This lonely race that you're in
You're just a lonely rider looking for something to ride
Driving till the other end
This lonely race that you're in
You're just a lonely rider looking for something to ride
You're just a lonely rider looking for something to ride
Oh here I am after all these years
In a little hole in New York City
It's a little room up there
To cover me up by this snow as it falls outside
Out to all sweets of the pavement city
Will I ever feel the cold miles and miles away from home
And haven't found a snow on Forty Second street
See the hough pretending how they want you
Still I never paid for it miles and miles away from home
Could it ever break you
Could it ever make you in New York
Does it make a difference on the other side
She may well be sleeping now
So cover me up with the dreams we share
If we could sleep tonight
In this heated carpet magic city
Could it ever break you
Could it ever make you in New York
Did anybody tell you how high the sky
You say your life ain't easy
Your strength is in the knowing
That there is another way
It's clear to me that you are still sleeping
Did anybody hear you when you said there's more
Journey through the high now
The present was tomorrow
It's so easy if you see
But only the young die old
And time is a passing phase
Got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe your hair's all right
Rebel rebel put on your dress
Rebel rebel how could they know
Hot tramp I love you so
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they play it hard
You want more and you want it fast
Rebel rebel put on your dress
Rebel rebel how could they know
Hot tramp I love you so
Hot tramp I love you so
You can't get enough but enough ain't the test
Transmission and live wire
You try a vibration and a handful of loot
You want a DJ when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Yeah I'm feeling down
It's such a blow I feel the clown
That I'll come out well
Now I've had it rough
Yeah I took this stuff
Doors and bars and metal
Doors and Bars and metal
There's mega bars and no guitars
Now now when I'm free
With no fairy tale lies
No more lies no more lies
Doors and Bars and Metal
Doors and Bars and metal
All my life all my life
Doors and Bars and Metal
Doors and bars and Metal
Anytime at all you call me
If you're feeling down just call me
Find a way to hide your sorrow
Let it wait until tomorrow
We could tune away together
I don't know what it is about you
There's something special in your way
Yeah every time that I'm around you
I feel it when you're there
I fell it anywhere in the world that you are
Where we're hanging so low
I've been around so many lovers
So many faces in my time
You've got that something I ain't had yet
If you want me I will say
If it's right then I'll say
Never had love so fine
Say what is yours will be mine
Cause there's no doubt in my mind
I heard you call my name
Till you made your play
Wasn't really trying to make it with you
Wasn't really trying to make it with you
I can't believe my eyes
But look at your face
There's no messing around
Again gone off to easy
Oh I will tell you to your face
Wasn't really trying to make it with you
Wasn't really trying to make it with you
Wasn't really trying to make it with you
Wasn't really trying to make it with you
Caroline must have faced trying to smile
And when she comes round
She often turns to me
To bring on her laugh for a season
So won't you come home with me
Can you hang around with me
Won't you come home with me
Won't you come home with me
Can you hang around with me
Won't you come home with me
Caroline gets it off against the wall
When she flies along with her feelings
And the summertime days the wall can turn to fog
So won't you come home with me
Can you hang around with me
Won't you come home with me
So won't you come home with me
Can you hang around with me
Won't you come home with me
So won't you come home with me
Can you hang around with me
Won't you come home with me
Won't you come home with me
Can you hang around with me
I want you any way you are
And take it oh so far
You're tearing my mind apart
When something you grab hold of me
Oh girl I'm right beside you now
You gotta ride oh girl I need some of you
Cause you are what you are
Yes in loving you're a superstar
And drive you oh so far
Oh girl I'm right beside you now
Oh girl ride it from you
Yes ride ride on to my love
Yeah ride ride ride ride ride on to my love
You never wanted to ride
I ain't gonna lose out a second this time
Taking it high leaving it low
Make it the fast lane I'm taking this time
Friends and lovers soon discover
That no matter what your strata
What was yours is mine
For putting your love on the line
I ain't gonna scream ain't gonna lose
All this tension is driving me high
Taking a crash I'm gonna win
I'm gonna lose her I'll never say die
Watch me feel me leave the rest behind
Trust no body know what's mine
I will break your mind
Now carry your love on the line
You can't take your loving on time
Carry your love on the line
Take all my chances this time
Carry your love on the line
I'm gonna break out this passion of crime
And what was once yours will be mine
Watch me feel me leave the rest behind
And no matter what your strength
I won't hide this time
If you lay your love on the line
Now can't lay your love on the line
Can't take your love out of time
Carry your love on the line
Take all my chances this time
Now carry your love on the line
Can't take you love out of time
Carry your love on the line
I like to be where the boys are
A cabaret plastic dolls where the boys are
Where the boys are I will go
Where the boys are in the show
Where the boys are blue
That's where the boys are
Where the girls will tear you all
Where the girls are strong and tall
Where the boys are blue
That's where the boys are
A pretty face tries to live
The stars for the night
Where the boys are I will sway
Where the boys are apt to play
Where the boys are blue
That's where the boys are
Where the girls are dressed to kill
Where the girls that always will
Where the boys are blue
That's where the boys are
Where the boys are I will go
Where the boys are in the show
Where the boys are blue
That's where the boys are
Where the boys are I'll go
Where the boys are in the show
Where the boys are blue
Where the girls will tear you all
Where the girls are strong and tall
Where the boys are blue
That's where the boys are
You don't understand me you tell me I'm wrong
But I fell you're OK and all right
You're living every moment in your make believe
And you're telling me something ain't right
But I've been lost in your bed
Cause you and me ain't going ahead
You know the fashion words that you said
Are torn out louder than passion
Set the fashion rising again
Set the fashion jiving again
The main attraction driving to you
Set the fashion things that we do
Fashion set the fashion
It's a body or gig or a lover
You say it easy when it's going your way
So you don't need a rock and roller
But you get lost in your head
When you remember the things that we said and all
The fashion words that you read
Were often lost inside of your passion
Set the fashion rising again
Set the fashion jiving again
The main attraction driving to you
Set the fashion the things that we do
Fashion set the fashion
I was always second class
You're always in command
You seldom ever dream
You live alone far too long
Someday soon you'll hear our song
Do you find the photograph
On the back of every magazine
And you'll see that the Beverly Hills
And you'll see a bunch of thrills
When you're there look at me
You know you're never out of your life
Roll it over and lay it down
And we ran with the gang
We were all in the news
With our blue suede shoes
And we ran with the gang
That music like ours couldn't die
And we ran with the gang
We were all in the news
With our blue suede shoes
And we ran with the gang
That music like ours couldn't die
And we ran with the gang
That music like ours couldn't die
And we ran with the gang
We were all in the news
With our blue suede shoes
The summer sun sitting high in the sky
And love that's in everyone's eye
You feel loose and get out in the sun
Summer's here and we're gonna have fun
Two weeks are past and at last
We can really feel free
And you can run in the sun
Walk in the sand hand in hand
With the boy that you met on vacation
And on a warm summer night it's all right
And you're right on the down of the sea
On the beach where the gang's gonna be
We can stay there all day
Until the fall is over over over
In the evening he's waiting for you
And you go to the beach barbecue
I used to sing to you
We used to kiss hello
And then we said goodbye
And made each other cry
Remember all the little things
I wonder why we ever had to say goodbye
We used to sing along
The sparkle in your eyes
Was like the starry skies
To the beat of the drum
And the band began to play
Remember all the little things
If you hate me after what I say
Can't pull it off any longer
Just gotta tell her anyway
You're the one girl in town I'd marry
Wish I never had known you better
Wish I knew you before I met her
Should have told her that I can't linger
There's a wedding ring on my finger
It's a teenage dream to be seventeen
And to find you're all wrapped up in love
And I found that you made a dream come true
Now I do believe in what I say
You've got to give a little love take a little love
Be prepared to forsake a little love
And when the sun comes shining through
We'll know what to do
Give a little love take a little love
Be prepared to forsake a little love
And when the sun comes shining through
We'll know what to do.
When I walk with you there is just we two
And the world goes by but I just don't care
And I know one day that I'll find the way
To be safe and sound within your heart
So until I do I'm gonna give a little love take a little love
Money can't make you turn your head now
Money can't get you into bed now
Can't give more than you get now
Living like a princess with a frown
Giving I can't afford a crown
You better ask your daddy for the caddy
Jive on baby we're in Carolina
On a rock and roll honeymoon
Rock and roll honeymoon
Better get a preacher
And I'll meet you when the school bell ring
We ain't got the money for a twenty carat diamond ring
But what do you think about a midnight rider
You know we can do it too
On a rock and roll honeymoon
Rock and roll honeymoon
On a rock and roll honeymoon
Rock and roll honeymoon
You know we can do it too
On a rock and roll honeymoon
I get my kicks from rock and roll
A 12 bar boogie gonna bless my soul
Wanna dance to that rhythm
I don't wanna play no heavy jazz
With high class music
And its stuffed shirt nights
And rock the night away
And rock the night away
I don't wanna play no Memphis soul
Make my name in the headline news
I'll play my music just as fast as I can
Yes I'm a rock and roller
When the morning comes exciting like a forgot about melody
You will be a person of loneliness
Doesn't matter now much to me
And I'm gonna feel right in my moment of freedom
Being better life when I forget about you
Like I get with only you
It was easier pretending that I was happier than before
Telling everybody I sleep at night
I never think about you any more
And I'm gonna feel right in my moment of freedom
Being better life when I forget about you
Like I get with only you
And I'm gonna feel right in my moment of freedom
Being better life when I forget about you
Like I get with only you
I phoned the local station
I kinda like the things they're playing
So I settled down to listen nice and easy.
The DJ plays our kind of music
He's asked us folk to choose it
But it all adds up to another
And anyone who's feeling lonely
And make a little conversation
And in the night there's music playing
Soft behind the words he's saying
Would I like to make a dedication
This song I wanna dedicate to you
And to everyone who feels the way we do
As long as you're a part of me
The song will play on endlessly
I hope my dedication's getting through
I'm standing in this lonely city
There's not enough to keep me busy
And we can't meet till I can take
You'll never know how much I love you
Lying here thinking of you
And all I got is a late night music station
This song I wanna dedicate to you
And to everyone who feels the way we do
As long as you're a part of me
I hope my dedication's getting through
Dedication playing just for you.
This song I wanna dedicate to you
And to everyone who feels the way we do
As long as you're a part of me
The song will play on endlessly
I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only know I never want to let you go
Ever since we met you've had a hold on me
It happens to be true
I only want to be with you
It doesn't matter where you go or what you do
I want to spend each moment of the day with you
Look what has happened with just one kiss
I never knew that I could be in love like this
It's crazy but it's true
I only want to be with you
You stopped you smiled at me
And asked me if I cared to dance
I fell into your open arms
I didn't stand a chance
I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together honey I don't care
Ever since we met you've had a hold on me
It's crazy but it's true
I only want to be with you
It's crazy but it's true
I only want be with you
You stopped you smiled at me
And asked me if I cared to dance
I fell into your open arms
I didn't stand a chance
I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together honey I don't care
I never thought that I could be in love like this
It's crazy but it's true
I only want to be with you
No matter what you do
I only want to be with you
It's crazy but it's true
Yeah I'd like a chance
Come on get up get on the floor
Trying to keep this cool
I'm much too shy to be afraid
Funky music a funky song
Funky music it feels so fine
You've found the way you stole my heart
Once you've made the grade
I'll have to leave you now and fly
Funky music a funky song
Funky music it feels so fine
I wanna see you dance
Funky music a funky song
Funky music it feels so fine
See the way you dance
See the way you dance
The clown came down to meet me
With a smile upon his face
He fired his starting pistol
And began the human race
There were faces all around me
They were running everywhere
But everywhere is nowhere
And nowhere isn't there
A game that we're playing
I don't mind but I don't make the rules
A game that we're playing
Just a game for lovers and fools
There's snakes upon your ladder
And there's dice upon your skirt
There's lipstick on my collar
And there's sweat upon my shirt
But you know that I don't care
And nowhere isn't there
Let me see you in the glow.
In the fire light you are shining...
If this love I feel will grow.
Let's take tonight to start out finding...
Everything will be all right.
I will keep your candle burning.
Open up your heart to me.
I can see your love light glowing.
Let us taste each other's wine.
Till the cup is overflowing...
Everything will be all right.
I will keep your candle burning.
I believed all love has gone
I've no strength to carry on
Thought my world was upside down
Then you walked on to my life
Went to work to set things right
What's the secret that you use
You made me believe in magic
You know that I can be true to your love
You made me believe in magic
Your love's put magic into my life
Now I'm filled with new sense to be
You gave my life harmony
Loving you is all I need
You made me believe in magic
You know that I can be true to your love
You made me believe in magic
Sail across horizons as the ocean sails towards the Eastern Sun
Then a voice called out for love and I was gone
Like a child yeah I was hooked on love
Those Eastern eyes were made to torment a guy
Like a child yeah I was hooked on love
Like a child yeah I was hooked on love
Baby it's good to see your face again
It's been some time I've missed you so
Those lonely years go by and look how much you've changed
And you know what love is for
You say you don't need me you're not a little girl anymore
Oh you're a woman I can see it in your eyes
So I'll turn and walk out through the door
Can't stand to hear your woman lies no more.
Those lonely nights I'd lie and think of you
I know that I was wrong
And look how much I've changed
And you know what love is for
I'm thinking now of you
I know you think of me
And all the things we do
And when I think of the times
We acted so blindly I see
We played out our plays
I'm thinking now of love
And how it used to be
Just like a hand in glove
And not a ship at sea
And when I think of the times
We acted so blindly I see
We played out our plays
La la la la la la la la la la
I'm thinking of the pain
We put each other through
Well I can take the blame
For how could I blame you
And when I think of the times
We acted so blindly I see
We played out our plays
La la la la la la la la la la
We've been hanging on
And I really miss you now
You're only a phone call away
And I'll be home any day to my
And I know you're mine
Someone take my place
I'll hold you at last
That would ease my mind
I've been hurting you.
You've been loving me
And I'd gladly pay the price
Yes I'd gladly pay it twice
You're only a phone call away
And I'll be home any day to my
Oh I really miss you now
How I long to hold you now
You're only a phone call away
And I'll be home any day to my
You're only a phone call away
And I'll be home any day to my
Make an early air ride then you crash your car
Tripping out on Sunday when you find you're a star
New York on Monday when your LA was fine
So you take another jet stream and get lost in your wine
Everybody wants to be somebody but nobody wants to give the time
Down the line East 65th Street on my mind
There's love in the air
It's just the price you have to pay
For your ride on Saturday
It's just the price you have to pay
Well standing on the corner when she catches your eye
Offers twenty twenty dollars for a twin it's on your mind
Everybody wants to give the time
There's loving in the air
The smoke gets in your eyes
It's only you in disguise
But it's the price you have to pay
There's loving in the air
It's just the price you have to pay
For your ride on Saturday
I don't know what it is about you
There's something special in your way
Yeah every time that I'm around you
I feel it when you're there
I fell it anywhere in the world that you are
Where we're hanging so low
I've been around so many lovers
So many faces in my time
You've got that something I ain't had yet
If you want me I will say
If it's right then I'll say
Never had love so fine
Say what is yours will be mine
Cause there's no doubt in my mind
When life gets too hot to handle
I know a place where the people feel the same
I'm going underground
Never has to ask your name
I'm going underground
And I know I'll never make her cry
I'm gonna make her mine
I'm gonna go underground
To find a world to make my own
I'm gonna go underground
To find a girl to call my own
To find a world to make my own
I'm gonna go underground
To find a girl to call my own
I'm going underground
That young one there by the subway door
Her dark red hair and her eyes of misty blue
I'm going underground
Singing need you coming more
I'm going underground
I don't ever wanna lose her
I don't ever wanna make her cry
But I know I'm gonna lose her
To find a world to make my own
I'm gonna go underground
To find a girl to call my own
To find a world to make my own
I'm gonna go underground
To find a girl to call my own
And I know I'll never make her cry
I'm gonna make her mine
To find a world to make my own
I'm gonna go underground
Going to London again
To find me some old friend
And in time I'll be there
Now I'm living in my own domain
Still I'll go to London
I feel so lonely when I'm left at home
With all the other boys in town
Why am I the only one
I'm a first class loser
That you don't wanna have around
I keep calling in the dead of night
Until you say your gonna start
And well I know it's sounds funny
But I don't wanna be in love
Just want a piece of the action
And there's no amount of money
That could ever be too much
To get a piece of the action
To get a piece of the action
To get a piece of the action
Little by little I'm beginning to learn
That you're a many man woman
And it's heavy on my mind
Anytime you wanted love
You just snap your fingers
And it's not very hard to find
I don't want to tie you down
But it'd be so good with you around
And well I know it's sounds funny
But I don't wanna be in love
Just want a piece of the action
And there's no amount of money
That could ever be too much
To get a piece of the action
To get a piece of the action
To get a piece of the action
I don't wanna be the life of the party
I just want a little excitement laying it down
Well I know it's sounds funny
But I don't wanna be in love
Just want a piece of the action
And there's no amount of money
That could ever be too much
To get a piece of the action
Well I know it's sounds funny
But I don't wanna be in love
Just want a piece of the action
And there's no amount of money
That could ever be too much
To get a piece of the action
Well I know it's sounds funny
But I don't wanna be in love
Just want a piece of the action
And there's no amount of money
That could ever be too much
To get a piece of the action
These tears that words are
Make me wanna be with you
But I need to spend my body
And no page can release it
Like this amplifier can
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
God I must be crazy to express myself this way
And electricity's a devil with a twenty amp fuse
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
In a man's genetic code
Till my genes explode
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
Yesterday when I was young
I played the game and never won
Thought rock and roll would bless
Songs of love and ecstasy
Remind me how it used to be
I thought those days would never end
But now it seems I need a friend
I remember all those days gone by
I remember all their faces
The old familiar places
No our song could last forever
Don't let the music die
Don't let the music die
I played the clown and Pantomime
Or was it just a dream that's gone
Echoed voices from the past
Recall the songs I thought would last
And the love we share's the reason why
I remember all those days gone by
The old familiar places
No our song could last forever
Don't let the music die
Don't let the music die
When we were young we had our time
But now that it's over
All the songs sound out of rhyme
No our song could last forever
Don't let the music die
After midnight everyone likes the light in the city
You do what you like all the people
Move about the floor in the shadow
One has to meet at the party you came to seek
There is just one thing I'd like know
How can I ever let you go
How can I ever let you know
How can I ever let you go
How can I ever let you know
I don't want to breakout
I just want to make love
I don't want to breakout
After midnight tonight everyone likes the light of the city
How can I ever let you go
How can I ever let you know
How can I ever let you go
How can I ever let you know
I don't want to breakout
I just want to make love
I don't want to breakout
I just wanna make love
I don't wanna breakout
I just wanna make love
I don't wanna breakout
I just wanna make love
I don't wanna breakout
I just wanna make love
I don't wanna breakout
I just wanna make love
It's a long time since I dreamed of you
I'm sorry I can't scene
Doesn't mean that much to you
Times are hard I've braved my lines
I'm lost without your love
Hey baby how you've strayed from me
The things that you make me through
Tell me baby why do you do this to me
How could you do this to me
Your love is all that I need
What could you make me believe
The time is set for me
I'll beg I'll steal I'll borrow
To have you next to me
Tell me baby how could you do this to me
How could you do this to me
Your love is all that I need
How could you make me believe
With what you say and what you see
I work all night to see your face like a fool I never win
Things run around going through my head
I'm so scared of what you'll do
Can you picture I'm in love with you
Paradise is something new
It's like I'm dreaming today I'm in love with you
I work all night to see your face like a fool I never seem to win
Things run around going through my head
I'm so scared of what you gonna do
Its does something nice to me
Hit the right spot on me
You do something nice to me
With what you say and what you see
It feels real nice when you're close to me
Cuddle up real tight babe what you do to me
I work all night to see your face like a fool I never ever win
Things run around going through my head
I'm so scared of what you gonna do
Its does something nice to me
Hit the right spot on me
You do something nice to me
Its does something nice to me something nice
It's a physical world
Love is a gun it's a shot of the flame
Touch my body release my crime
It's a passionate thing
It's a crime of the heart
Love in action it's a chain reaction
Touch my body release my crime
Come on Come on Come on Come on
All alone at night I sit and wonder
If your the girl that's really meant for me
I cry at night alone I sit to wonder
Cause everyone they tell me what they see
Oh lady you take me higher
Oh lady you're crazy for me now
You tell me there is nothing I can do
Without your love I'm sure that I'll go crazy
I'll never stop no matter what you do
Oh lady you take me higher
Oh lady you're crazy for me now
How can I let you know that your loving me
How can I let you know that I want you to say
There's something inside the spirit of the things you say
What can I do to love you just another way
We have no fear of love no fear of women
No fear of love no fear of giving
There's something inside the things you say
Now that I love you more there's no other way
We'll make it through the storm
And all you got to say is
This could be love do you get enough
This could be love I can't get enough
Oh baby could this be love
This could be love do you get enough
This could be love I can't get enough
Oh lady this could be love
Just maybe it's me your thinking of
Oh I need you don't wait too long
Could this be love what I'm thinking of
Could this be love could this be love could this be love
There's magic in the air
And this night belongs to us
Things I said to you I want need you
Oh lady this could be love
Just maybe it's me your thinking of
Oh I need you don't wait too long
Could this be love what I'm thinking of
I feel it when your near
Every moment when we touch
And when get to loving It's only you I need
Oh you lady could this be love
I need you don't waste your time with other guys
Could this be love could this be love
Could this be love could this be love
Could this be love could this be love love
Could this be love could this be love
I want to be around you and play your game
But every time I see you as still the same
I see your eyes they wander carefully
And looking everywhere but into me
It's all a state of illusion that's come my way
And only you can realize just what to say
Was It a love experience that we had
It's emotion that your giving to me
It's emotion that you want me to see
It's emotion that your giving to me
It's emotion that you want me to see
It's emotion that your giving to me
It's emotion that you want me to see
I bought my baby a red radio
He liked to dance to it down in the streets
He said he loved me but he loved the beat
But when I switch on I rotate the dial
I could see it there driving him so wild
I bought my baby a red radio
He said he loved me but he had to go
It's just the same old show on my radio
It's just the same old show on my radio
It's just the same old show on my radio
It's just the same old show on my radio
On my radio on my radio on my radio
I bought my baby a red radio
He liked to dance to it down in the streets
He said he loved me but he loved the beat
It's just the same old show on my radio
It's just the same old show on my radio
It's just the same old show on my radio
It's just the same old show on my radio...
I bought my baby a red radio
A red radio I rotate the dial
A red radio driving him so wild
It's just a Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
Gonna dance with my baby till the
Tell her all the little things I'm
It's just a Saturday night
I can't take it no more
Until you're back here baby
You are the one and I can't let you go
This is where my heart belongs
Until you're back here baby
You are the one and I can't let you go
Until you're back here baby
Until you're back here baby yeah
You are the one and I can't...
Until you're back here baby
Until you're back here baby
Until you're back here baby
You are the one and I can't...
Until you're back here baby
Until you're back here baby
Until you're back here baby
Until you're back here baby
Until you're back here baby
Until you're back here baby
Don't think that you got me girl
Don't think you can tame me and change me
Don't think that it's all because of you
Just because I don't run around
Just because we're forever together
Don't you think of a four letter word to use
So what if I just don't want anybody else but you
So what if you're all that I ever really wanna do
I know what you're thinking but that doesn't make it true
What if I just can't sleep at night
I see your face in the starry skies
Don't think that you got it made
Don't think it's so easy to keep me
Never know it could all just fade away
So what if I just don't want anybody else but you
So what if you're all that I ever really wanna do
I know what you're thinking but that doesn't make it true
So if my heart just skips a beat
That I can't make it without her
I can't forget the day
And I'm still dreaming about her
The next time you see my girl
I would die to hold her
The next time you see my girl
The next time you see my girl
I walk the streets and I
See lovers passing by
And it's all a reminder
Of what it used to be
When she was here with me
I only wish I could find her
The next time you see my girl
I would die to hold her
The next time you see my girl
The next time you see my girl
I see her face and I realize
So next time you see my girl
And tell her that I love her
The next time you see my girl
I would die to hold her
The next time you see my girl
How can I convince you
That you're really not alone
And I know exactly what you're going through
Nothing is for certain
But there's one thing that I know
Never underestimate what love can do
Even though there are no guarantees
Love can do most anything
It can take you to the highest high
Make you sacrifice it all
Love is unpredictable
It can change your life forever
It may never hear your call
Love is unpredictable
Love is unpredictable
Love is unpredictable
We don't need to justify
And we don't need to wait
If you intellectualize the meaning of this fate
You may never know what we could find
Don't keep me waiting
You won't know what love can do
It can take you to the highest high
Make you sacrifice it all
Love is unpredictable
It can change your life forever
It may never hear your call
Love is unpredictable
Love is unpredictable
What am I supposed to do
Haunting me everywhere
Watching the candle flicker out
When will the night be over
I didn't mean to fall in love with you
And baby there's a name
For what you put me through
I'm sleeping with the ghost of you and me
Seen a lot of broken hearts
Phantom ships lost at sea
And one of them is mine
I sing a toast to the midnight sky
The stars don't seem to guide me
I didn't mean to fall in love with you
And baby there's a name
For what you put me through
I'm sleeping with the ghost of you and me
The ghost of you and me
When will it set me free
I hear the voices call
Following footsteps down the hall
Trying to save what's left
Watching the candle flicker out
When will the night be over
I didn't mean to fall in love with you
And baby there's a name
For what you put me through
It's in the way you caress my face
Like you always used to but differently
We can smile to hide the shame
Here in the pouring rain waiting for the sun
I'm crying here all alone standing next to you
You have done your best to see it through
By the way that you love me
That the fire's burning out
By the way that you hold me
That the fire's burning out
Moving down an open road
Asking our hearts for direction
I can see the faded signs
Leading to the same destinations
We're dancing to the music
You've done everything that you can do
By the way that you love me
That the fire's burning out
By the way that you hold me
That the fire's burning out
My heart is in the wind
I've done everything that I can do
By the way that you love me
That the fire's burning out
By the way that you hold me
There were times I knew
But I found it hard to say
You were special in my life
Never thought you'd go away
Without you in my life
I can see through your lies
I never found your love
And you don't want me anymore
Why should I even try
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Someone else I will find
A memory I've left behind
If I ever made you cry
Any reason I can't find
It was lonely by your side
Like a fool I stood by you
Without you in my life
I can see through your lies
I never found your love
And you don't want me anymore
Why should I even try
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Someone else I will find
A memory I've left behind
Is there something I could do
Is there something I should say
Is there someone else
To keep you from me now
And you don't want me anymore
Why should I even try
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Someone else I will find
God knows I've been hurt before
You know what I've been through
Time helps but it doesn't cure
The scars will never heal
Said your love was never ending
But it slowly disappeared
I know you want my heart
But a friend is all I need
Love on the outside is all I can give
But this love on the inside needs some place to live
I know that you love me
You said a million times
You know that it's hard for me
Been told a million lies
Said your love was never ending
But it slowly disappeared
I know you want my heart
But a friend is all I need
Love on the outside is all I can give
But this love on the inside needs some place to live
It's love forever and a day
Love on the outside is all I can give
But this love on the inside needs some place to live
I'm still on your side
You found a place where you belong
New friends that can do no wrong
That's what you believe
But who is going to be there when you fall
To build up when you're feeling small
Give you love that you need
When the whole world turns against you
Don't you know that I will stand up for you
No matter what you're going through
I'm still on your side
Don't care if it's wrong or right
I'm still on your side
You want to run you want to break free
What you want ain't what you need
Can't you see that I care
I know I'm hard on you sometimes
But when you are looking for the things you can't find
Don't you know who'll be there
When it's more than you can handle
Don't you know that I will stand up for you
No matter what you're going through
I'm still on your side
Don't care if it's wrong or right
I'm still on your side
I'll be there when you need me
Don't you know that I will stand up for you
No matter what you're going through
I'm still on your side
Don't care if it's wrong or right
I'm still on your side
I will be around when the others let you down
I'm still on your side
Anytime you need help and you can't find nobody else
And now your face lights up the sky
Somehow I feel that's you're close by
And when I'm happy you can see
And everything that I can do every wish I make for you
In the end it all came true and I
Couldn't live without you
Everything you give to me feels as though it's meant to be
If you ever ask me how I feel
Now I'm thinking of you when I can't explain the feeling
But I know that it's real when I hold you
I knew I couldn't live without
Without you ever in my life
Everything you give to me feels as though it's meant to be
So if you ever asked me how I feel
Can you help me ease the pain
Can I hold you once again
You know that they often say that love is blind
The reason why you left our love behind is hurting me
Is there a chance that we can be again
Hold my head up wipe the tears
I'm not crying for you no more
Now the rain has gone and the sun has come to shine
Nothing can get me down today
Got my mind made up as I'm driving through the fields
Nothing can get me down again
I've gotta make a get away
And in my mind you're with me once again
And inside my heart there's a place for you
And in my mind I'm with you once again
From the rain that's gonna come
Hope I make it all the way
Trying to find my way
But the rain keeps falling down
Doesn't matter anyway
I've gotta make a getaway
And in my mind you're with me once again
And inside my heart there's a place for you
And in my mind I'm with you once again
Take a look at the sky
And in my mind you're with me once again
And inside my heart there's a place for you
And in my mind I'm with you once again
Take this world and all it's become
I wanna get out of this place
When we're just staring into space
Give yourself a chance to be free
You gotta give yourself a break
In the end the love you receive is equal to the love you take
In the park smell the freshly cut grass
And it seems like yesterday
Take this world and all it's become
I wanna get out of this place
When we're just staring into space
Give yourself a chance to be free
You gotta give yourself a break
In the end the love you receive is equal to the love you take
But that was yesterday
I don't know what you are I don't know what you are
I don't know where you are I don't know where you are
Take this world and all it's become
I wanna get out of this place
When we're just staring into space
Give yourself a chance to be free
You gotta give yourself a break
But all I've got is the time it takes me to hurt you
Without something to believe in
Now all I've given is all I've got
But all she had to say...
Give me anything you want
Will only get you through the night
Give me anything you want
Will only get you through the night
So I don't ask no questions
Then I've got no objections
We can handle situation
And all you've given is all you've gained
So all I've got to say
Give me anything you want
Will only get you through the night
Give me anything you want
Will only get you through the night
Give me anything you want
Will only get you through the night
Give me anything you want
Will only get you through the night
Give me anything you want
Will only get you through the night
Give me anything you want
I thought that you were working late
But that was when I made my first mistake
As you walked into the hall and saw all the clothes upon the floor
She said she didn't understand
And as she cried she took the ring from off her hand
Then I knew it was over as she turned to me and said
After all is said and done
I know I'm not the only one
To have had it all and thrown it all away
We're all alone under the sun
I know what I did was wrong
But you don't know what you've got until it's gone
If there were something I could say to you to make you change your mind
After all is said and done
I know I'm not only one
To have had it all and thrown it all away
We're all alone under the sun
I'm not to live without you
Cause all I got is here with now
But I don't wanna live without
After all is said and done
I know I'm not the only one
To have had it all and thrown it all away
We're all alone under the sun
Every day just seems so long
Every minute that I'm here without you
Will tomorrow ever come
Will I ever get a chance to feel you
I need you so much...
You're out of reach but you're so close
You're out of reach but you're so close
You're out of reach but you're so close
But you're out of reach
Another rumor I can't hide
Another night without you here beside me
I need you so much...
You're out of reach but you're so close
You're out of reach but you're so close
You're out of reach but you're so close
But you're out of reach
I need you so much...
You're out of reach but you're so close
You're out of reach but you're so close
You're out of reach but you're so close
But you're out of reach
If you let me be a part of you
If you tell me what I gotta do
I don't wanna see another day
If I ever let you walk away from
And here I can see why
I need her close to me...
Everything that I ever wanted here
And I don't wanna make believe
Never needed anyone before
Never knew you could give me more than
I don't wanna be afraid again
You're the one that saves me when
And here I can see why
I need her close to me
Everything that I ever wanted here
And I don't wanna make believe
If there's a way to make you mine
Everything that I ever wanted here
And I don't wanna make believe
Everything that I ever wanted here
And I don't wanna make believe
And tell me what you see
And nothing in between
And run away with me...
To all the tears you cry
That you could never hide
I can make you believe
I'll always be there by your side
I'll show you what he means
Just run away with me
I can make you believe
I'll always be there by your side
You've heard it all before
But there's nothing I want more
I can make you believe
I'll always be there by your side
Yes I'll always be there by your side
I don't need your touch
I don't want your lies
Burning deep inside of me
I don't want your sympathy
I should have known that it was over
It was different than before
As the love was turning colder
You didn't need me anymore
So I think I'm giving up
I don't want your lies
Burning deep inside of me
I should have known that it was over
It was different than before
As the love was turning colder
You didn't need me anymore
I don't want your sympathy
I don't need you here with me
I don't want your sympathy
I can't take it anymore
Because I've heard it all before
I should have known that it was over
It was different than before
As the love was turning colder
You didn't need me anymore
When the world didn't know where to run
I've been watching the world as it passed me by
Trying to climb but I just can't find my feet
Doesn't matter what life you lead
Lost in the world as it passes by
Trying to smile but you just can't hide your tears
That we can live together in a land of broken dreams
If we put our hands together and pray for all our hopes and dreams
Watching the love as it passes by
Trying to smile but I just can't hide my tears
That we can live together in a land of broken dreams
If we put our hands together and pray for all our hopes and dreams
Floating on your own star
That's always sent to break your heart
And put it back together once again
That we can live together in a land of broken dreams
If we put our hands together and pray for all our hopes and dreams
That we can live together in a land of broken dreams
If we put our hands together and pray for all our hopes and dreams
You don't know what it's like
To be there when it's over
If love was like a battlefield
Would you put me on your shoulder
Time don't mend broken hearts
And this one's getting colder
And as the seasons fall apart
And I feel a little older
To leave me where I'm standing
That its only the beginning of the end
This love is like an open door
And I'm tired of just pretending
That its only the beginning of the end
When I gave my heart to you
I didn't know what love could do
To all the pain it'd put me through
That its only the beginning of the end
There were times I knew
But I found it hard to say
You were special in my life
Never thought you'd go away
Without you in my life
I can see through your lies
I never found your love
And you don't want me anymore
Why should I even try
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Someone else I will find
A memory I've left behind
If I ever made you cry
Any reason I can't find
It was lonely by your side
Like a fool I stood by you
Without you in my life
I can see through your lies
I never found your love
And you don't want me anymore
Why should I even try
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Someone else I will find
A memory I've left behind
Is there something I could do
Is there something I should say
Is there someone else
To keep you from me now
And you don't want me anymore
Why should I even try
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Someone else I will find
You will always be the one that I adore
Means so much to me but dreams you were before
It's you Emily to me but dreams you were before
It's you Emily that makes me write this song
All that's new to you seems so old to me
Now I'm far away a minute seems so long
It's just another day without you
It's just another day when I'm not there
I'm going to find a way to be so close to you
You've got to know how much I care
It's just another day without you
It's just another day when I'm not there
All this I'll give to you I swear
Longing to hold you feel you in my arms
Never let you go far from me for long
Girl I promise you my feelings are so strong
Eyes are open wide but still so much to see
All that's new to you seems so old to me
When I'm far away a minute seems so long
If only you could read what's on my mind
See right through my eyes
And now your face lights up the sky
Somehow I feel that's you're close by
And when I'm happy you can see
You and I go way up high
Not to heed the crowd
Love is a high wire act
We've got to get our balance back
And I know we can still do that
We've already lost our way
The memory of yesterday
Is still strong enough to light the way
Whatever may lie ahead
Keep your eyes on me now
Is all we need to fortify
I wanna end all this suffering
A second chance is coming
Love is a high wire act
And I know you can still be that
We've already lost our way
The memory of yesterday
Is still strong enough to light the way
Don't listen to the crowd
I know it's hard to find real shelter here
We've already lost our way
The memory of yesterday
Is still strong enough to light the way
Whatever may lie ahead
Keep your eyes on me now
There's so many reasons that I find
In my life now I'm away
Nothing good comes easily
And we both know that it's wrong
Till I'm back where I belong
There's a feeling inside
It just won't go away
Having to face each night alone
Knowing you are the one
With the love that I need
And I miss you more each day
Emotions running away with me
And our love that runs so deep
And we both know that it's wrong
Now I keep on waiting
Till I'm back where I belong
There's a feeling inside
It just won't go away
Having to face each night alone
Knowing you are the one
With the love that I need
And I miss you more each day
Till I'm back where I belong
There's a feeling inside
It just won't go away
Having to face each night alone
Knowing you are the one
With the love that I need
Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen it'll start with a smile
It won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping and you can't seem to find
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
Believe in the magic of rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Do you believe like I believe Do you believe in magic
Do you believe like I believe Do you believe in magic
This place I never thought would feel like home.
Far away and I always thought I'd end up here alone.
Somehow the world has changed me.
To give back the things they took from you.
I'll always know where you are.
Except to thank who's watching over me.
But somehow I feel so strong.
To be the one I never thought I'd be.
I'll always know where you are.
There's something I've been keeping from you
I've been fighting with my feelings lately
Although I may seem distracted
There's no need to feel neglected
I've been wanting to tell you how I'm feeling
I've waited for this moment all my life
And I wondered if it's what you wanted to hear
But I've made up mind
I know I've taken my time
Now I know there's no doubt anymore
So now I've told you my intentions
Or are you feeling mixed emotions
Are we gonna stay together
For more than just a brief encounter
Are you gonna make my life complete
I've been wanting to tell you how I'm feeling
I've waited for this moment all my life
And I wondered if it's what you wanted to hear
But I've made up mind
I know I've taken my time
Now I know there's no doubt anymore
Are we gonna stay together
For more than just a brief encounter
Are you gonna make my life complete
I've been wanting to tell you how I'm feeling
I've waited for this moment all my life
And I wondered if it's what you wanted to hear
But I've made up mind
I know I've taken my time
Now I know there's no doubt anymore
If I could touch your body
Has got a body like you
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
And when that love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showing you the door
I gotta have... Faith
You say I'm giving you the blues
Maybe you mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
But I'll wait for something more.
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
I've reconsidered my foolish notion
But I'll wait for something more...
I thought we were going somewhere
You needed time on your own
That you had your chance
I've been waiting for you
I can't go on like this
No longer can I resist
And I... feel like it's going away
What did I do that was wrong
I wanna know... Oh...
As though we were drifting apart
That you had your chance
I've been waiting for you
I can't go on like this
No longer can I resist
And I... feel like it's going away
When I gave my heart to you
You can't deny that you said that you loved me
It was never meant to be
I can't go on like this
No longer can I resist
And I... feel like it's going away
I can't go on like this
No longer can I resist
And I... feel like it's going away
I can't go on like this
And I... feel like it's going away
Imagine we are all alone
Shining high up in the sky
And getting deeper every day
But not as deep as my heart
I'd fly into your arms
Baby if you could fly
Time it slowly slips away
Soon I'll have your love
Girl you know that I can stay
One kiss is just enough
Are getting deeper everyday
But not as deep as my heart
I'd fly into your arms
Baby if you could fly
We've got to spread our wings
We've got to fly away
I'd fly into your arms
Baby if you could fly
I've never seen you but I know that you exist
I'm just trying to save us time
I'm back on the lonely road...
Cause come tomorrow I'll be gone
You know that I did not lie
Out on that lonely road
Cause come tomorrow I'll be gone
Cause come tomorrow I'll be gone
Cause come tomorrow I'll be gone
You came to watch the band
To see us play our parts
You hoped we'd dress like tarts
But back stage we stand naked
My poet sheds his pretty skin
And turns to face the day
This morning I feel dead
Like time machines...
Like voices on the winds
But someone made it worthwhile
They gave me full attention
And took me by surprise...
Today the feeling's gone.
This morning there's no hope
And the words that I sung so clear
Are now clouded by my tears
Open to none but the strange and the wild
Envelopes marked for the personal life
Echoed words spoken by token romantics
That love is swift arrows my dear
Dressed you in blue jeans this year
Odes to be written by passions sick hand
Ends and beginnings that never quite meet
That love is swift arrows my dear
Dressed you in blue jeans this year
Out across the heavens
Floating out your window
Wrapped in your dressing gown
Jet Silver and the Dolls of Venus
Span the space between us with a tune
Jet Silver and the Dolls of Venus
Change your faces slowly
But to be reborn all has to die...
Children of past summers
It's time to tune the band
Jet Silver and the Dolls of Venus
Span the space between us with a tune
Jet Silver and the Dolls of Venus
Someone had called him queer
But he's finally saved enough to pay another call
She can do him twice nightly and an encore
Leave your money on the shelf
Pretend you're someone else
She will really lay it down
She will break your heart
She will break your heart
You go and tell him he's not the only one
Night creatures on your heels so high
Burning the film behind his eyes
Night creatures on your heels so high
She gave me such a fright
Well all her jewels were phony
But they looked as nice as ice
Freezing the light behind the stairs
White faces and painted eyes
Night creatures on your heels so high
Night creatures on your heels so high
My airship dreams had found a clearer sky
I've been thinking about the state I'm in
I started sinking a bottle of gin
In this rocket cathedral pointing to the sky
In this rocket cathedral pointing to the sky
In a rocket cathedral pointing to the sky
And get rebounded down the Milky Way
In a rocket cathedral pointing to the stars.
In this rocket cathedral pointing to the sky
Bridges and rivers and buildings pulled down
Time spent in places my footsteps had found
Walking with November mists
Pathways and windows and movies in May
Quiet old ladies who'll soon pass away
Paintings and songs that I'd done in a day
Fires on spires and chimneys of black
Fields on horizons with pylons that crack
With singing sad wires for council house mystics
To apply their statistics
The radio was singing love songs
Saw the smiles upon the soldiers
Coming home across the fields
The calendar said first of August
Romance and promises of summer days
I strolled unclothed into your garden
To feel the warm sun on my face
The saving of the human race
Who down below hang the washing out to dry
Frilly briefs and flying helmets in a line
Above the cities and the towns
Flying high across the sea beyond the clouds
Said goodbye to the others
The old musicians of the past
Said hello to the young things
Drank the wine of the new vine
Growing wild inside my heart
Time to see beyond the dark
Who down below hang the washing out to dry
Frilly briefs and flying helmets in a line
Above the cities and the towns
Flying high across the sea beyond the clouds
On which no house may stand
I'm painting pictures
On walls across the land
Burn down the prisons
In which your children grow
The truth behind the show
No martyrs and no kings
The kingdom lies within
There's no trains to heaven
Disarmer of every tide
That swept the beaches clean of starfish
You're with me most every night
You're with me most every night
No fashionable disguise
A sleeping kiss and my demon twin lays dreaming
Beating pinioned wings against the skies
They are searching there
And they are searching there
Came to me one rainy evening
Warmer then the setting sun
She laughed at my fears
Said now love don't you worry
Make everything so clear
She's all right she's all right
She's all right she's all right
She's got piece of mine
She's all right she's all right
She's got piece of mine
Smiles like the Mona Lisa
Kisses like the greatest lover
The world has ever known
Dance like Ginger Rogers
Sing like a nightingale
Makes love like an angel
Cause my soul to wail
She's all right she's all right
She's all right she's all right
She's got piece of mine
She's all right she's all right
Behind the gasworks after midnight
Mad Jane she holds a sweaty hand
She dreams she hears the gasworks band
Somewhere cathedral bells are screaming
As someone's dog answers a call
The phantom of the bingo hall
Meanwhile the miners on the night shift
You know to them it feels like gold
A neon sign bleeds in the darkness
A thousand clubs for working men
But crazy Jane she's just a mill girl
Bridges and rivers and buildings pulled down
Time spent in places my footsteps had found
Walking with November mists
Pathways and windows and movies in May
Quiet old ladies who'll soon pass away
Paintings and songs that I'd done in a day
Fires on spires and chimneys of black
Fields on horizons with pylons that crack
With singing sad wires for council house mystics
To apply their statistics
Well I'm waiting in the wings
With all the strings and things
That help me make the music
Just another curtain call
Before I fall into your arms
This guitar does not lie
The great deception is not my
Who sings of love and acts so cool
I play the crown and hero torn
Between darkness and the girl
This guitar does not lie
The great deception is not my
Who knows the shape of things to come
The thrills that I have won
The kiss that time's begun
Piano keys don't please me they're so dark
And it's so easy to forgive them
And violins still scream from every room
You've ever passed your presence through
For love with the madman is a sad affair
A long long way to fall
By the baton you conducted
In this symphony of trouble and confusion
She's a maid in heaven
He's a knight on the tiles
It's just a question of style...
It's a time for giving
Is just the price of a smile...
It's not easy to live this way
Just an hour and a fleeting kiss
Silent night of wonders
Day breaks through the door
Two shadows thrown on the floor.
Hold me now go lightly
Take the rough with the smooth
Feel so dizzy underneath your open skies
And it's strange the games we play to hide the crime
I am a prisoner who has thrown away the key
My soul has vanished with a bird who flies so free
And wings of change have strapped themselves o'er me
I am waiting here for the tide to turn
And the byways of the air to open
I am a changeling like the wind across the waves
Though in the end there will be nothing left to save
I will return one day with all the time you gave
Past our fading window's eyes
And the panes are pains inside
All the glories fast unfold
All the joys lo and behold
Bold children of the air
Swoop and fighting feathers fly
Leave the hue and cry
In the room behind the door
Like a ghost who walks the floor
I go searching for a trace
And feel so weak for a while
From your passionate smile
Hear the wind beneath the trees
It's the soundtrack of my dreams
And the song it sings
Is of the earth and sky
All the sleepers who awake
Know too well the poisoned taste
Cold fountains in the dark
Pass beneath your shining arc
Oh part of me is crystal too
In the marble mausoleum
In the shadows I can see them
Blue bed spread they give me head
When they said that the rose had no thorns
Past our fading windows eyes
And the panes are pains inside
Standing by the old car
Listening to the bluebirds
Praying for a sunrise
Maybe we'll make music in dreamland tonight
Someone in the garden
Walking through the moonlight
Sailing in the silence
Hoping for an insight
I know we'll make music in dreamland tonight
Maybe we'll go waltzing in dreamland tonight
I paint them in my sleep
Sometimes they make me weep
You are in my pictures too
Portraits of the moon in silver and blue
Ringing in the changes
Chiming like a church bell
Laughing in the mirror
Phantoms of the hotel
Oh well we'll make music in dreamland tonight
Driving like a madman
Trying to make a fast time
Waiting for a new rhyme
No crime to make music in dreamland tonight
It's time to make music in dreamland tonight
Sometimes a photograph
Sometimes a looking glass
Your dreams still unfold
Your dreams still unfold
Sign your name with a star
Your dreams still unfold
Between the worlds are pearls
Around your lily white neck
I'll silver and steel you away to my island of sea jade
All the girls declare it so
Between the worlds I go I go
Between the girls are worlds
So proud the shroud has fallen to my knees
I know the sway of your charms like a snake
I'll give you my head
In a casket of silver and sea jade
Life is a love affair
All the girls declare it so
Between the worlds I go I go
With our bodies on fire and our heads in a spin
We pressed close to the moment
So we lay soul to soul
As the archer of the night
While the company derided me
Tie me up in your hair
Sink me deep in your oceans
Lock me up in your bedroom
Oh won't you lose that key
Let me show you a sign
Pure as the virgin snow
Sail awhile with me through my dreams
Hear the many enchanted themes
In several keys of blue
Sing for you my swan song
Oh strange strange harmony
Oh such a sad refrain
Feels like a thorn in the heart for me
Feels like I'm dying again
With our bodies on fire and our heads in a spin
We pressed close to the moment
Let me give you the time
We can bathe in the wine and the honey sublime
Till the last curtain call
Till the curtain calls
Like the moon and the sun united as one
Like the nearly insane
When the game is all done
Take me up for a ride
Far from the stony ground
Glide the skies with me in my dreams
Hear the secrets of the themes
In several shades of blue
Sing for you my swan song
Just give me your money and I'll give you my pain
Looks in the mirror and pukes on the floor
Tries to remember the cause of it all
He just gave her a drink so she gave him a ball
But I expect you expect a lot from me
I can feel your burning need
To make my young heart bleed
For you and your pubescent blues
About your boyfriend Stan
And he'll get you if he can
Another fool on the stage with a traveling band
She lays in the gutter with a knife in her throat
She gave you a thrill so you gave her a grope
The show goes on despite the wrong
The strong still rise
And the weak still fall
The stars are burning
The world is turning underneath
This canopy of night ...
Somewhere tomorrow warms the distance
The dawn must come although we will deny it ...
I'd like to hold you here
Beneath these clouds of darkest blue ...
It could be a million years
Let the moonshine shine
You know that in the end it all comes true ...
Heavenly thoughts in heavenly minds
Like a square peg in a round hole ...
Like a harp without it's strings ...
Like a sailor who sails no oceans ...
Like a bird that has no wings ...
Sailing away and forever our pleasure is blue ...
Like a cloud without a sky ...
Like a mother without a child ...
Searching for a silver lining
Hoping that the clouds I'm climbing aren't hiding rain.
For every show now disappoints me.
Still the ghost of love lost haunts me till my dying day.
Over the river of tears.
To face all my troubles and fight like a man.
Praying on the holy mountain that it won't rain.
Follow the Sun and the Moon
But that would be a lie.
My heart's in your hand
And I'm leading a band full of blues
Searching for a silver lining
I've got a sleep that burns ... a sleep that burns ...
Got a sleep that burns all night.
I'm locked in your dark world
I've got a sleep that burns ... a sleep that burns ...
Got a sleep that burns all night.
So hold me while I'm screaming ...
Your youth is a mask but it's not made to last
For we all have a past to out run
When the mask comes undone
And we race on and on
Go and tell all your friends
That you've witnessed the end
Of the world in a dream ...
I wake in a cold sweat
I've got a sleep that burns ... a sleep that burns ...
Got a sleep that burns all night.
Exhausted and reeling ... all heartbeats and sighs ...
Got a sleep that burns all night ...
I have appointments that I must keep with my past ...
The demon is on the phone ...
Orchestrations of a different nature ...
Arrangements that I made to end it all ...
Dancing at the old musician's ball.
And these beauty secrets that I've kept so long
But read them now because before too long
They could fall apart at every seam ...
We can pretend there's a stage ...
I'll be your hero only as long as I'm paid.
Drink up and let's go home ...
The demon is on the phone ...
He's playing a dialing tone ...
Beneath the stars there are the bars that serve the bitter drink.
But I'd dearly love to go back to my own time.
Isn't all the brochures say.
It's too dangerous to stay.
Airships crashing every day into the bay.
It's all highways in the sky.
All the oceans have run dry.
Those pictures you said were strange ...
You always put the blame on me ...
Going out of style and it's not worthwhile anymore ...
Looking at you and the way you shine.
Like a sharp knife ...
It's time I took a stab at a new life ...
There's nothing left for me to lose ...
Going out of style and it's not worthwhile anymore ...
You're having a ball with the men of the law ...
But the poet and his pen are free
And there's nothing you can do
That will ever bring me to my knees ...
Calling me names ... You make me feel like I'm crazy ...
Nothing left for me to do ...
The man who owned the heartache
That lived on the stairs
For fear my eyes shone a light
On the darkness he drew like a cloak
All around his shoulders ...
And the church on the corner
Marked the time for the mother
Who was giving birth to a child across the hall ...
For an answer to the call for help
I had written on the wall.
And the rain fell like jewels
On the heads of all the fools
Who wandered crazed with their souls ablaze for me ...
And the blessing of the hour
Was the twilight and the tower
With its golden bell from the bottom of the sea ...
And the moon through the window of the bedroom
Made a silver dance of such dust beneath the bed ...
Listening to their hearts
Messengers of the fall.
The phone number's on the wall.
Salvation brings a badge to wear
On the glad rags of your soul.
Just keep up with the payments
And we'll make your misery whole.
We've got albums of redemption
From the following address
South Revelation Row.
It's a wonderful place to go.
It's a wonderful place to go.
Posters make a prophet if you've got a soul to sell.
Messengers of the fall.
If you see me smiling
It's just the speed of the wind
If you want me laughing
It's just the speed of the wind
It's just the speed of the wind
It's just the speed of the wind
If you hear the ringing bells
It's just the speed of the wind
If you fear your secret
It's just the speed of the wind
It's just the speed of the wind
It's just the speed of the wind
There's too much shadow in your room tonight
This time before time begins
We'll touch the sky with our tragic wings
Your world's a sinking place
We'll sink the night on maiden names
See what a fortnight brings
With the speed of the wind
With the speed of the wind
If you see me smiling
It's just the speed of the wind
If you want me laughing
It's just the speed of the wind
It's just the speed of the wind
It's just the speed of the wind
If you hear the ringing bells
It's just the speed of the wind
If you fear your private
It's just the speed of the wind
It's just the speed of the wind
There's a crystal at the heart of every tear
On reflection making love affection clear
And she is blue as jewel
There's a silence at the edge of every sigh
There's a light that haunts the corners of her eyes
And she's blue as a jewel
There's a moon deep within her girlish breast
There's a rose that blooms with every warm caress
And she's blue as a jewel
She makes her moves and they suit me fine
She's nobody's fool but word gets out
I can't dispel the glimpse of hell
There are stories that she tells when she's asleep
There are secrets that she shares but stills he keeps
And she's blue as a jewel
There's a picture that she paints without a brush
There are times when all her silver turns to rust
And she's blue as a jewel
And she's blue as a jewel
My mind has been set free
The airships cross the sky in sight of you
They fly their message high to read the daily news
Nothing here for certain
Hid behind the curtain
Go put your nylons on
The airships cross the sky in sight of you
Nothing here for certain
Leave behind the curtain
Rob you of your youth
We are the chosen ones
We'll do what no one's done tonight
So kiss the truth goodbye
We'll climb upon your lies
Shot through the heart by dear devoted passion
And the falling stars that never fall
Still call the guilty to heaven
They starve their souls with murder proud
Hangs a man of hollow leather
See the clouds form without sound...
That scream around in the heads
You can find us again in paradise
The curse that binding
We are the light in the lantern
Your blindness brought you
We are the dazzling phantoms
The woman of moon flew into my room last night
She tortured my body and made me feel sorry
Though I though I was right
Gave me the kiss of light ... Gave me the kiss of light ...
Gave me the kiss of light ... Gave me the kiss of
I'm grinning like a fool
Spread your love around my head
I'm feeling rather cruel
Alone in the dance hall we spoke of her next incarnation...
I asked what it took and she gave me a look
Needing no explanation
Gave me the kiss of light ... Gave me the kiss of light ...
Gave me the kiss of light ... Gave me the kiss of
Love is such a thrill
She gives me the kiss on light
And all my mirrors are windows
She gives me the kiss of light
And I don't know where the time goes
And mine is to be her taste of the sea this morning...
We caused a sensation
The future was changed as we stood in the rain
At the back of the station...
Gave me the kiss of light ...
Gave me the kiss of light ...
Gave me the kiss of light ...
A young man waiting for the snow...
The cup of sorrow overflows...
But my soul is all at sea
The night has had it's way with me
This game is growing rather grim
And some of us must sink or swim
But I'll play the sailor brave
From the cradle to my grave
The ghost with the silver smile
You're the gold at the end of my rainbow
Our enemies are at the gate
Well armed with jealousy and hate
But my sword is in my hand
And I will fight at your command
The storm is raging in my head
The ghost with the silver smile
You're the gold at the end of my rainbow
I've been up all night
It's been down so long
There's a fire in my heart
Won't you feed my flame
You can help bring back the spark
You can bring it back
You can bring it back
You've been killing time
I can't even see the scars
You can help bring back the spark
You can bring it back
You can bring it back
There's a star in the sky in morning
I keep thinking it's some kind of warning
They say the end of the world is near
They say no one survives but have no fear it's not this year
Nightmares in the sun
I hear voices in the dark
Won't you ease my pain
You can help bring back the spark
You can bring it back
Modern music on my radio
Another station and another show
If only I could let my feelings flow to you...
When you're lonely and you're far away
When those steel guitars begin to play
Please don't let them steal your heart away from me...
I hear the rhythm of the rain begin
A shining broadcast on the silver wind
The moon is melting in the blazing sky
I hear the flames sing but I don't know why
I hope that only shadows see me cry for you...
I feel like I'm falling
You know that I'm needing all the love that I'm leaving
I wonder if you're all alone
Beneath those diamond stars
Tonight this desert world is ours
I'll meet you by the towers
For cocktails in the bar
We're going out there in July
We'll watch the plastic shell roll by
I feel I'm half a universe away
I left my home some time ago
To fight the creatures of the USA
You tell me that this neon world is free
Say this is the place I ought to be
The time has come for me to go
Modern music on my radio
Another station and another show
If only I could let my feelings flow
When you're lonely and you're far away
When those steel guitars begin to play
Please don't let them steal your heart away
Please don't let them steal your heart away from me
We hid our hearts beneath the stars
In midnight rooms and shining cars
We're both insane on this crazy night
A secret message on the phone
It's all the same when you sell your soul
And we will sail thee off together
For you can help me clear my fame
Wake up in a strange bed
Pearly whites and cloud web
Photograph my wild head
Shoot me to the stars
Shoot me to the stars
We walk in silence through the void
For only darkness knows the choice
A pleasure grand and a deep delight
We cruise the highways of desire
Above you heads and climbing higher
And angels hide on the demon's shore
And we will sail thee off together
For you can help me clear my fame
Wake up in a strange bed
Pearly whites and cloud wed
Photograph my wild head
Shoot me to the stars
I took a walk down terminal street last night
To see the ancient faces living there
I saw the sunken eyes of agony
And saw the desperate stations of despair
The madman waiting for the spirit girls to come
In a song well written but unsung
I saw the smiling wardens cracking down the noose
In which my drowning head was hung
Who glide the alleys searching for their lair
I heard a voice like winter call my name
Said very soon that I would join them there
And all the creatures born of ink and rage and lies
Crawled off my pen and ran across the page to die
Fascination was the germ of their disease
Degradation is the term of their release
Like angels in flight
Like bells in the night
Light shining so bright
Like bells in the night
Like bells in the night
Nevermore days astonishing
Happening with tapes and anything 1962
Power beyond years are endings
Science as uncontrollable anxiety
Even more than international
Perhaps inside our different events
No more years of this emphasis
Direct purposes and artificial songs
Hang on your metal tongue
Watch those royal and cheery blue storms
The curve of time time against unsung knowledge
The curving of piano dancing
The ticking of clocks against the window
Against the window a face invisible
Many dimensions critical variations
Life doing roller coaster
But first play a wakening celebration or inspection
The beautiful stars ringing clear
Many dreams have vanished from my view
But there has been no answer
My innocence and laughter
I'm feeling older now
But what comes after this is through
Time had traced its maps across my face
Sign and lines for you to navigate
There will be no returning
No regrets and no yearnings
Could keep and fill your heart
If all you've got to what you do
The ancient quest for meaning calls me now
Over the edge of my horizon
And all the fields of green that I must plow
To reap the harvest of the stars
I see the isle of Avalon
By thinking words I feel
The broken beat of holy drums
Flashing eyes of suns
The chalice fills and overflows
Then ancient day's begun
On tides of blessed faith
Here in this land of Albion
Two thousand years from you
Two thousand years from you
The highway's leading
Screaming like a jet tonight
Don't know what I'm after
But my wheels are going faster
Than the speed of light
Thunder screams thunder
I think I'm going under
With my streamlined thrill
Got a psycho desperate German
Beneath the stars there are the bars that serve the bitter drink.
But I'd dearly love to go back to my own time.
Isn't all the brochures say.
It's too dangerous to stay.
Airships crashing every day into the bay.
It's all highways in the sky.
All the oceans have run dry.
Like a square peg in a round hole ...
Like a harp without it's strings ...
Like a sailor who sails no oceans ...
Like a bird that has no wings ...
Sailing away and forever our pleasure is blue ...
Like a cloud without a sky ...
Like a mother without a child ...
Came to me one rainy evening
Warmer then the setting sun
She laughed at my fears
Said now love don't you worry
Make everything so clear
She's all right she's all right
She's all right she's all right
She's got piece of mine
She's all right she's all right
She's got piece of mine
Smiles like the Mona Lisa
Kisses like the greatest lover
The world has ever known
Dance like Ginger Rogers
Sing like a nightingale
Makes love like an angel
Cause my soul to wail
She's all right she's all right
She's all right she's all right
She's got piece of mine
She's all right she's all right
Just give me your money and I'll give you my pain
Looks in the mirror and pukes on the floor
Tries to remember the cause of it all
He just gave her a drink so she gave him a ball
But I expect you expect a lot from me
I can feel your burning need
To make my young heart bleed
For you and your pubescent blues
About your boyfriend Stan
And he'll get you if he can
Another fool on the stage with a traveling band
She lays in the gutter with a knife in her throat
She gave you a thrill so you gave her a grope
The show goes on despite the wrong
The strong still rise
And the weak still fall
Behind the gasworks after midnight
Mad Jane she holds a sweaty hand
She dreams she hears the gasworks band
Somewhere cathedral bells are screaming
As someone's dog answers a call
The phantom of the bingo hall
Meanwhile the miners on the night shift
You know to them it feels like gold
A neon sign bleeds in the darkness
A thousand clubs for working men
But crazy Jane she's just a mill girl
Bridges and rivers and buildings pulled down
Time spent in places my footsteps had found
Walking with November mists
Pathways and windows and movies in May
Quiet old ladies who'll soon pass away
Paintings and songs that I'd done in a day
Fires on spires and chimneys of black
Fields on horizons with pylons that crack
With singing sad wires for council house mystics
To apply their statistics
Messengers of the fall.
The phone number's on the wall.
Salvation brings a badge to wear
On the glad rags of your soul.
Just keep up with the payments
And we'll make your misery whole.
We've got albums of redemption
From the following address
South Revelation Row.
It's a wonderful place to go.
It's a wonderful place to go.
Posters make a prophet if you've got a soul to sell.
Messengers of the fall.
Feel so dizzy underneath your open skies
And it's strange the games we play to hide the crime
I am a prisoner who has thrown away the key
My soul has vanished with a bird who flies so free
And wings of change have strapped themselves o'er me
I am waiting here for the tide to turn
And the byways of the air to open
I am a changeling like the wind across the waves
Though in the end there will be nothing left to save
I will return one day with all the time you gave
She's a maid in heaven
He's a knight on the tiles
It's just a question of style...
It's a time for giving
Is just the price of a smile...
It's not easy to live this way
Just an hour and a fleeting kiss
Silent night of wonders
Day breaks through the door
Two shadows thrown on the floor.
Hold me now go lightly
Take the rough with the smooth
I speak to you through electrical language
Sometimes you hear me when our frequencies meet
You try to listen but you don't understand it
With new precision the golden days return
The program for tonight to send my senses reeling
Let's walk into the sea
Let's walk into the sea
Let's walk into the sea
Let's walk into the sea
There's mystery in the air
The kind I never share.
Beating on your bleeding heart
Wrecked beyond repair.
The shadow of the stars
In black and silver cars.
Speeding through your heart
Pricking like a poison dart
Cutting to the quick.
There's mystery in the air
There's mystery everywhere.
A whisper in your ear
A touch so light when no one's there
The face you cannot see.
It rains inside your room
You will be drowning soon.
Breathing in and breathing out
A river through your soul.
I bought you surreal estate
Hanging gardens for your gate
You said that I could stay
See you through to another day.
That day became a year
Time flies in this atmosphere
Automatic in the head my dreams of you.
Bring telescopes and read the stars
They say the future's ours to penetrate
The city dwellers drop like flies
Delirium and madness in their eyes
Accept no fake surreal estate
I bought you surreal estate
Hanging gardens for your gate
Ancient orchards in the rain
Magnetic fields and railway trains.
Here beneath our haunted moon
In a room of green we disappear
Invisible to all the world we practice sleeping
Keeping time by nothing clear.
Accept no fake surreal estate
I love you with a fever
I love you like a fire
Everything is burning
With the flames of my desire
I love you like the movies
And I love you when you're sleazy
I want to be your camera
I want to be your dancer
I want to be your question
And I want to be your answer
I want to be your mystic
I want to be your gypsy
I want to be your target
Anytime you want to hit me
And there's nothing in the world that can cure the fever
And there's nothing I can do to put out the fire
And there's nothing I can take that could take me higher
In the cities there is talk of rain and fire
For they had raped both body and soul
The taste was much too hard to swallow
We ran naked through the cold
The clouds they bled like open wounds across the sky
Trying oh so hard to die
We'll lock our hearts and throw the keys into the sea
It's thunder storms over the hill
There's panic in the world
There's panic in the world
There's panic in the world
There's panic in the world
It's after midnight in the city of broken dreams
Over the river by the old hotel
There's a big car coming like a bat out of Hell
It's the dangerous stranger in his ghostly limousine.
You get the feeling that he's running in an endless race
Driving through the city like a razor across its face
Stops on the corner in a flash of flame
He's the stranger with a danger if you ever get to play his game.
I want to go for a ride
To see what lies on the other side
With the dangerous stranger from a station on the other side.
I want to go for a ride
To see what lies on the other side
The night is black and the stars no longer burn
The radio says that we're past the point of no return
I scream at the driver but he says
He's the dangerous stranger on a highway to the end of time
And it's getting all ecstatic cause it goes on automatic
When the lights go out.
There's one in the TV and it's waiting there to please me
When the lights go out.
Sometimes I wish I could make it go away.
When the lights went out.
I know it seems outspoken but I'd love to see them broken
When the lights go out.
Sometimes I wish I could make them go away.
And they're trying to get me at it
There's such a beautiful mess up in my room
My thoughts are tangled in the legs of chairs
I like to think that it's my token of genius
But then again perhaps I just don't care.
I'm going crazy with the speed of living
I'm leaving parts of me all over the place
I think I've found a piece that looks like my heart
But then again maybe it's just my face.
I charge my dreams up with the cheapest batteries
The light goes out and everything looks dim
Doing fine until the truth breaks in.
I think machines and clocks have secret motives
I paint my shirt with all the latest outrages
Just like I did so many years before
It drives me to the brink of pink disaster
Come with me to the fire festival
Let us burn each other blind
Dance till the end of time.
Come with me to the islands of the dead
To smoke and ash of laughter in your head
Pack up all your mortal memories
Cloak your soul in sleep
The moon is in the window
And the wind is in the trees
These things are yours to keep.
Oh come with me to the islands of the dead
Let us sail sail sail sail away
To smoke and ash of laughter in your head
In the islands of the dead
In the islands of the dead
In the islands of the dead
In the islands of the dead
In the back of your car
Where the light from the stars
Caught our eyes in a moment of blue
It was then that I knew
All my feelings were true
And what lovers like us have to do
And the time ran so fast
Like an arrow that flies to the heart
And I thought that a lifetime
Would not be enough time
To delight in this pleasure so dark
Their hearts are the size of night clouds
Their actions are jealous and proud
And who knows the bruises they bear
For lovers are mortal
As frail as the breath that they share
In the shadows of doorways
Where lovers are always
The victims of torches and chance
I would hold you so near
Till the scent of your hair
Sent me reeling my mind in a trance
Oh I still can recall
The soft music of rain falling
Silver and cool in the night
And it washed through our love
Like a river in flood
Like an ocean of tears shining bright
And I like to believe
That the memories we weave
Are the bittersweet echoes of dreams
In the evening their call strays
From yesterdays hallways
Like the faraway chimes on the breeze
Their hearts are the size of night clouds
Their actions are jealous and proud
And who knows the bruises they bear
For lovers are mortal
Shadows move across the faces
Of the people we once knew
And though their hearts are full of sorrow
The sun inside can still shine through
In the factories and the stations
In the house of the poor
In the darkest of all places
There is still an open door
In the factories and the stations
In the house of the poor
In the darkest of all places
There is still an open door
When you lose the smile your smiling
When the blues stare down on you
You are still the lamp that's shining
So let the sun inside shine through
So let the sun inside shine through
So let the sun inside shine through
Let the sun inside shine through
And John Wayne and Mark Twain
And you and Michael Caine
The ones we all adore
And Mendelssohn and Paul and John
The ones we all adore
The ones we all adore
Welcome to the only place where I can reign supreme.
Please stay a while and see just what I mean.
To places you have never been before.
Stay with me and I'll show you so much more.
Where hate and conflict languish side by side.
So don't forget what you have left behind.
I only know that you've seen inside my mind.
Welcome to the only place where I can reign supreme.
I am a friend indeed.
Out to the furthest star
That you can see on high.
We can fly wherever you're wanting to go
And all of your dreams can come true
In the space of a minute or two.
Days can blend into hours.
The sight and the scent of the flowers
Invade everything you do
And all of your dreams can come true
In the space of a minute or two.
Here is one of the ways
That you can still command
I see the torches burning bright
Marching out into the night...
I turn my horse towards the sun.
They say the movement has begun
An end to sorrow and despair.
I turn my horse towards the sun.
To find the peace I know I want.
We turned our horses to the sun.
They say the movement has begun
An end to sorrow and despair.
We turned our horses to the sun.
What the community could do
When they saw what had been won
And what the Soviet had done...
They turned their horses to the sun.
They say the movement has begun
An end to sorrow and despair.
General in the field of responsibility.
Do you ever wonder if the fight must still go on
You don't drive the tanks or fire the gun.
Don't explain the feeling that's inside your very soul.
The enemy must perish one by one.
As I looked around I could hear no sound
There was just my boat and me.
The sun was shining down like a bright new pin.
I pulled myself over the side
And suddenly I espied
Breaking the surface foam was a fish's fin.
As I looked around I could hear no sound
There was just my boat and me.
I played him for half a day.
And then as soon as he tired I began to pull him in
And when I got back to shore
A dozen people or more
Cane to see this fearsome fish that I'd brought in...
What a time to fall in
As I looked around I could hear no sound
There was just my boat and me...
Brush up the pieces of the vase that's on the floor
And I will tell you stories that the vase can tell no more.
And painted by an artist who lived down south in Kent.
Over the years it has become part of the family.
It held the aspidistra that my grandma used to grow.
When the wills were read in the early spring of 1943.
So please pick up the pieces of the vase that's on the floor...
And it could stand them all again.
You've been a pillar of economy
But now this mill is closing down.
And through those years of industrial strife
And it could stand them all again.
You've been a pillar of economy
But now this mill is closing down.
The lonely streets are dark and bare.
Its walls are damp and overgrown.
You've been a pillar of economy
Roaring out its battle cry
Thunders forth to do or die
Accept their orders and obey
And some will cry whilst others pray.
It happens now as yesterday
Once more the lie that told you God was on your side
Is just another nation's pride. The promises
That they would never charge again
Have proven true for many men
Whose sun will never rise again
Accept their orders and obey
And some will cry whilst others pray.
It happens now as yesterday
In a chaos of refracted light
The silent fish swim day and night
Watched by the ever prying eyes
As up above the fire will rise
And through the fire you meet the stare
The rainbow bridge across the skies
There stalks the silent living soul
Witness you the Northern Lights
Showing you and showing me
The supple choreography
Which replenishes that which has gone to the air
Since the water you had is now floating up there.
Then the rain will come tumbling out of the skies.
It will come back again in an equal supply
It will come back again in an equal supply
As the morning sun will pass.
Oh morning sun can you see me
Oh morning sun can you see me
Bow their heads to the wind.
Float the leaves on the wind.
Composed by the wind.
Have gone with the wind.
And the tall pine trees shivered
As the freezing wind blew through.
Held their courses straight and true.
And the lumberjack leaned on his log
And watched as though he knew
And the clear blue sky was covered
By a layer of fleecy cloud.
And the snow fell through the trees
Like a falling mourning shroud.
And the wind up in the conifers exalted clear and loud
And the snow was falling thick
He turned his face up to the shy
And slowly shook his head.
And he wandered through the pines
Down the steep and twisting track.
He never could attack
But don't forget what you have left behind.
The blackened chimneys rise above the town below.
Deep in the factories the furnaces still glow.
As it has done so many times.
The church clock might just as well have been asleep.
But with the dawn there comes the day.
Alarm bells ring and people wake.
They say goodbye to a world they'll never see.
Consists of hours and days and weeks and years.
Consists of loneliness and emptiness and tears.
Time is passing by relentlessly
Both for you and for me.
To the fact that when this universe just disappears
The many many years will pass on into time...
Consists of hours and days and weeks and years.
Consists of loneliness and emptiness and tears.
Time is passing by relentlessly
Both for you and for me.
But it can never return
When you describe the sun
Not in the words you use
But in the way your smiling eyes convey the meaning.
When you discuss the stars
Not in the words you use
But in the way you hold your cloak about your body.
And love is appreciation
And understanding of value.
When you describe the cold
Not in the words you use
But in the way your face reflects the warmth within you.
When you discuss the night
Not in the words you use
But in the way the rain is falling on your window.
And love is appreciation
And understanding of value.
When you describe the world
Not in the words you use
But in the way we sing our tuneless songs together.
When you discuss your dreams
Not in the words you use
But in the way you know no fear when you awaken.
And love is appreciation
A certain modicum of fame.
The much reported legacy
As left to her by Aunt Marie
The swirling dust around the feet
Of children playing in the street
Was swirling round the rubber wheels
Around the supermarket door
Where left for not a second more
Than takes the strength the stranger lacks
To break the thread that holds her back.
With something to be living for.
To satisfy the crying need
Commit the crime that the police
They took the child and in its place
They left a feeling of disgrace.
Untainted by the clink of ice
But side by side with scent of spice
Came poems from the flashing pen.
The wine was sweeter then.
The longer summers went their way
To sing a drunken roundelay
To sing the poem once again
With gaiety remembering when
The skies were bluer then.
The firelight flickers playing games
Went dancing on the window panes
As winter's daylight slowly wanes.
And shadows that are soft and warm
Kept flickering as they performed
Mazurkas in the winter's night.
The fire flickers bright.
For something somewhere lingers on
That conjured by nostalgia's wand
From pastures where the grass grew high
And green within the memories eye.
Were soaked by the deluge of rain.
The neon and sodium lights reflected brightly from the polished pavements.
With no movement save that of the rain itself
And then the rats came.
They came from the sewers that overflowed
The main thoroughfares and the precincts
All were filled with the scurrying of feet
And the dull sound of the rain hammering
On and on they came to take shelter and to feed
At the feet of Christ who hung upon the cross
And here in their hundreds of thousands they ate
And having done so slipped away into the night
Unchanged except to those whose early journey
Took them past the Church of the Sacred Heart
And who noticed in passing that the eyes of the hanging Christ
Like she'll never sing again.
In the crystal cold of dawn
She will sing her lonely tune.
The earth beneath the surface dust
Is cold and damp and raw
Can almost be forgiven
For remembering the dream
Of the wall of stones around the homes
The carriers with their loads
Were leaving for the northern towns
And also leaving far behind
The plague of London town.
George Vicars was the tailor
And to his house a case of clothes
From London town was seen
To be delivered one fine day
And never more was tailor Vicars
The scars upon his face and chest
And from the bell upon the church
The knell of death was rung.
Buried in their graves
As Thomas Stanley stood above
The differences between the men
That were so very wide
Were shattered by the desperate need
And rudely cast aside.
The forces of the two were joined.
Their words were not in vain.
Agreed to stay and die.
But high enough that they should know
The plague must stay behind the wall
For six long months the wall did stand
Never more were heard.
All buried in the ground.
The Coopers and the Vicars
Never made another sound.
The dawn that rang the final bell
The villagers rebuilt their lives
With those who still remained.
But it ran between the fingers of my hand.
The heaviest stone that the Devil could throw at Man.
And a sense to both imagine and to dream.
The heaviest stone that the Devil could throw at Man.
The heaviest stone that the Devil could throw at Man.
The heaviest stone that the Devil could throw at Man.
They gave me strength and the will to survive.
The heaviest stone that the Devil could throw at Man.
John Ridges saw the dull reflected glowing panel light.
And the time was 4.03.
The flying sparks before the eyes that wouldn't see again
And Driver Ridges felt the cooling wind upon his face.
And some survivors still maintain it was all the driver's fault.
Of the smiling face of the one who placed the rocks upon the lines.
Or at least she believed she remembered they had said
She was something they had never seen before.
Refusing to give to the curious wandering eyes
The pleasures of remembering the face they knew.
For she had believed in the days when she was young
A thing of which she had to be ashamed.
She never guessed it could appear so far away.
She had to take a look to see her hair was straight
Or at least she believed she remembered they had said
Silken spittle tracing out a net
Wavering a second here and there
To make some small repair
As countless years have led
That she might take her breath
Through countless million years she flew
Towards her final fateful destiny.
Uncharted wastes of cosmic void
The outward reaching atmosphere
Will burn the final grains of astral dust.
This atmosphere we trust
A day in time is little
Meaning nothing save the daylight
In the hours before the sunset
The noise between the shadows
Of the silence of the starlight
From day to day transcending.
And yet a day can follow
That can change with every hour
The sun will change the flower.
The flower will grow from nothing
And its perfume fill your senses.
Another life commences.
Another life to lead the path
Where other beings follow
The footsteps of a chosen friend
Which lead to their tomorrow.
Another life to hold you tight
Within the web it's weaving.
You're sad that you are leaving.
Its negative identity
Earth to be its name.
Wherein the germs of life are massed
So Earth began to form.
He who drinks the wine shall perish never.
He who understands the light within
Can now begin to know the reason.
Seeing his lasting peace upon the thunder
Clouds. A perfect dream in silence rides
And woe betides the poor believer.
He who sees the vision where his dream lies
Merely follows on towards the glow
As long ago he was commanded.
He who drinks the wine drinks to confusion.
The memories had begun to fade
Until the story was relayed
By someone whom I chanced to meet
Of what he'd seen of Ferris Street.
And so it was that I returned
To see the street that I had spurned
From Ferris Street where I was born.
A hundred years the wind has blown
The dust across the cobblestones.
It even blew their hopes aside
For here they stayed and here they died.
The stonework lying in the dust...
There's only me and the caresses
Of the waters of my brain
That rise and fall in me again
So my inadequacy shows
As I fight against the pain
On the bed where I have lain
Behind the charity charade
There lies the gleaming silver blade
That treats my body with disdain
That evermore it shall remain
To be amongst the fold again
And to no longer be insane
The search for the key to a life to succeed them
Which soon turns into sand.
A prayer to be borne on the wings of their blindness
A reason to cry at the moment of breaking
With nothing left at all...
Wishing for something the world is denying.
Someone to lean on and someone to trust.
To give or to take. To make or to break
Here you greet a stranger in this early dawn
As many more have yet to come.
The generation yet unborn
Will arise before it has begun
To see the Smoke of Eden.
But only gain and gather in.
The body where all souls are fused
Can call to all from that wherein
There lies the Smoke of Eden.
And you try to take me.
Here you break a vow you never meant to keep
But only wait and take your turn.
While darkened cities lie asleep
Will you fire a world so often burned
And free the Smoke of Eden.
Here you greet a stranger in this early dawn
As many more have yet to come.
The generation yet unborn
Will arise before it has begun
A dancing woman leaps
And as this apparition sweeps
Reflected from her eyes
Upon the tear she held so near
The words she cannot say
Though scream as hard she may.
The deep consuming blackness
That exists behind the light
Is beckoning the dancer
In the stillness of the night.
And she asks of those who see her dance
That they might understand
The movement of the twisting feet
And the waving of the hand.
She asks her audience to live
And the dancing mind translates.
The Musical Director brings
The consummating chords
The moment it applauds.
And the ballerina's body lies
So silent on the ground.
And protected from the world.
So that no one else may see
The light that shines so brightly
On the island that is me...
My star... my star...
Something that remained
Something that my eyes
And mine alone have ever seen.
Momentary freedom from
Her silver hiding place...
My star... my star...
My luminous deliverer
Is there to understand
To show me in the dark
A little light from far away...
My star... my star...
And may she always glimmer
In the darkness of my night
And through the gloomy days
Through the clouds of morning
And across the poison sea
The island that is me...
When the narrow streets were ringing
As the frozen fist of famine
And down across the valley floor
Came the hand and the heart
She carried from the bakery
Of the castle on the hill
Against her husband's hard command
She took the manna still
And gave it with the heart
Again and yet again she came
Carrying the bread of life
To lives so nearly lost
Until the hour her husband
Of giving with the heart
For I believe you carry bread
And crimson roses fell upon the highway.
For I believe you carry bread
And the thunder came from behind the hill
And the congregation watched the golden cross
Begin to crust in golden blisters.
And the church bell fell from within the flames
And the frightened children there within
Lifted up their eyes to stare at Him...
And He came with little more
But his eyes were bright from behind the smile
That carried him from deep in the foundations.
Then He raised his hand
And the children laughed and the people sang
And their golden minds were flying free
There amidst the falling masonry...
For although He stood amid the congregation
There was no one standing near him.
Then He spoke The Word
And the Father's voice alone was heard
A believable tango on the roadway to France
Out of the windows of the Bristol Museum.
The handles that power the stately machines
Are held by the killers who sweep the latrines.
The rows of medallions that hang on the chest
His jeep and his driver the law contravene
A Bavarian accent intoning commands
The motorboat complement never got through.
Now the ship of state is sailing
On a cold tempestuous sea.
She's far out on the ocean
And she's crewed by you and me.
And we haul on the mainsail halyard
The billowed sails are quickly reefed
And no one tells us why.
And he will never tell us
That our fate is in the hand
We've sailed for seven years
And only ocean have we seen
And the singing of the rigging
But we never heard a word
And now the sun is rising
And we gaze upon the yardarm
And then we turn and see his face.
The silk and gold and lace
And the light shines all around him
And then he points a blinding finger
As the oil below the ocean
Forms a fountain in the sky
Beckoned through the leaded panes
Standing silent on the stones
Without recourse to bit or reins.
All the jewels flashed together.
There upon the stones lay strewn
A hundred ears of golden grain.
Once again now tight secured.
The other three behind their leader
Confident in life assured.
Lanterns to dispel the gloom
Lit the loaves and sacks of grain
Echoes of the drunken laughter
Coming from the room.
Naked in the freezing night.
Disappearing out of sight.
The truck there on the skyline was waiting to explode
As angels sang in harmony on our side of the road.
Found Negroes in the woodpile with keys to all their locks.
Encouraged those with aerosols to turn their pressure can.
Both through a sense of justice and also being shy.
The desolate Commander who sees his force has flown
To ultimate dimensions far greater than they knew
Studying the Sergeant and peering down his throat.
Trying to find the secrets that the shoreline tries to hide.
The exercise is futile if your face is turning blue.
I watched him stick his neck out and I judged the end results.
The sickness in the hospital was carefully detailed.
Stands beneath the interchange the engineers have made.
As quietly I drove my car across the soldier's eyes.
But with a cry of victory that nothing else could bring
The butcher stole the audience and turned his veins to string.
Always makes the surgery a second before me.
His words possess a beauty in the way that they prescribe...
The monkeys in the circus up on the high trapeze
Come flying through the spotlight to where the safety net
Catches all the ashes from the monkey's cigarette.
The shining Iron Maiden with her undemanding games
Plays with anybody but will never ask their names
The doorman bows politely in his mink and ermine suit.
He passes out the papers the visitors must see
But carefully disguises the copies on his knee.
Became condemned for breathing and the creaking of my shoes.
Seeks to disassociate the eunuch in the fold.
In deference to the wishes of those that he defiled.
It has passed as the vein that brings the blood
It is yours. Is the mine so full of gold
Can you not see there is something there for you...
Now the time draws the closing of my day and of yours.
That it has gone and that you are next to go
And the broken remains of a Cherokee plane
Lie shivering out in the cold mountain rain
And no one appears to be hearing.
The radio crackles with pure white noise
Dancing around the Flowers of the Sea...
Such a dangerous scent is the perfume of hate
That infiltrates down through the chancery gate
And wafts through the window a moment too late
For anyone there to prevent it.
Even though it may resent it
When perfumed like the Flowers of the Sea.
With the one mistake that the cruiser made.
For you were only Flowers of the Sea.
The Welsh medallion dangled and hung.
Was sweating the way its mother had done
She came to rest upon a Guardsman's chest
Another tender Flower of the Sea.
All the light that comes from the spotlight's beam
Is sometimes so diffuse it seems
If indeed it cares a beanpole.
And the moon is but a keyhole
Peering at the Flowers of the Sea.
All the wild mosaic in Pharaoh's tomb
Kissed the economic boom
And placed a crown on he for whom
The broken stones were scattered.
For Pharaoh was a man who could
Commanding all the Flowers of the Sea.
But then Mahomet's greatest fan
Turned him into a heathen.
His car became a mobile tomb
And now the odds are even.
And John has joined the Flowers of the Sea...
But with no power to stop them come
The Sun turned tail in terror.
But still some light is left to see
Up on the High Sierra
Come you who ask of me
Your singers and your dancers
Unfolding in the alleys
Leading to the greater scandal...
A song of a million wings...
Follows the lemming...
The starling in your reason
That makes you follow blindly
On the leader of the season
Will take you through the blackness
And take you through your senses
And land you where you did not wish to go...
And talk to you in words you do not know...
Follows the lemming...
Come you who light the candles
Who fashion cloaks for guilty men
Whose guarantee of profit
Cruelty and violence.
Let he who goes guiltless throw the stone.
But slowly day by day she worked and year by year it grew
To a pattern even she could not define.
The break came in a flash the day she saw
There finishing a puzzle on the floor.
As another thousand pieces quickly tumbled from her hand
At the window in the door appeared a face.
An air of deep contentment came to pass.
Though perhaps it might exaggerate the truth.
The mirror never jokes about the news
When asked about the face that it reviews.
But if it shows up signs it traces in the lines
If you are wise there will be no surprise.
Rejecting all responsibilities.
The mirror never twists and never bends.
It shows you almost all that it intends.
You can't select what to reject.
The sick defeats and sad retreats
And guarantees that the mirror never cheats.
It freezes for you only what is there.
The mirror never smiles to ease your mind.
It never knew the meaning of unkind.
You are shown something unknown.
And it's unfair that the mirror never hates.
The children sitting at my feet
And listen to my tales of life
That they were taught in school.
The vision of an older man
As through the fog of failing sight
The cannon fodder. Sharp and short
Was death upon the poppy fields
That ever after grew.
I also cried for peace.
With a pointed hat and a gypsy caravan.
All through his early years at his father's knee
Would be a fool as his father was a fool
As his grandfather had been before him.
Not to end his days on a damp bed of straw.
He would be a fool as his father was a fool
As his grandfather had been before him.
And the Ladies of the Court would adore him.
He took his tricks and songs and his old caravan
And he ate all the scraps of the venison they gave.
As his grandfather had been before him.
All his tricks and songs to the notice of the King.
As his grandfather has been before him.
And he stayed through the years till his eyes were growing dim
And the King knew all the tricks and grew tired of all the jokes... and tired of him.
As your grandfather has been before you.
Always a fool with the tricks and with your songs
Or even this world might cease to spin...
And even the horse might talk...
And are marching out in front of me.
Calling in the distance through the early morning mist.
And are marching out in front of me.
The ship is big and rusty and it smells of cattle
We sing songs of England bound to temper every sword
And are marching out in front of me.
When they called for money for the water we did drink.
Then we drank his water and we didn't even blink
And are marching out in front of me.
And are marching out in front of me.
And they stood me on the dockside in my tattered uniform.
They put me to a man who sat me on a sofa
And are marching out in front of me.
And are marching out in front of me.
And the eagle takes the lamb
And carries her to distant crags
From where the flight began.
She travels straight and true
And crushes from the gaping breast
The blood that runs in you...
And the Mercedes coughs its way to life
You are to satisfy desires...
The wicked man remembers
What most of us forget.
Are how much greater is the good
To give than to receive...
And the Mercedes coughs its way to life
You are to satisfy desires...
You neither understand nor see.
Is ground into a powder dust
And the Mercedes coughs its way to life
You are to satisfy desires...
John Ridges saw the dull reflected glowing panel light.
And the time was 4.03.
The flying sparks before the eyes that wouldn't see again
And Driver Ridges felt the cooling wind upon his face.
And some survivors still maintain it was all the driver's fault.
Of the smiling face of the one who placed the rocks upon the lines.
Or at least she believed she remembered they had said
She was something they had never seen before.
Refusing to give to the curious wandering eyes
The pleasures of remembering the face they knew.
For she had believed in the days when she was young
A thing of which she had to be ashamed.
She never guessed it could appear so far away.
She had to take a look to see her hair was straight
Or at least she believed she remembered they had said
Silken spittle tracing out a net
Wavering a second here and there
To make some small repair
As countless years have led
That she might take her breath
Through countless million years she flew
Towards her final fateful destiny.
Uncharted wastes of cosmic void
The outward reaching atmosphere
Will burn the final grains of astral dust.
This atmosphere we trust
A day in time is little
Meaning nothing save the daylight
In the hours before the sunset
The noise between the shadows
Of the silence of the starlight
From day to day transcending.
And yet a day can follow
That can change with every hour
The sun will change the flower.
The flower will grow from nothing
And its perfume fill your senses.
Another life commences.
Another life to lead the path
Where other beings follow
The footsteps of a chosen friend
Which lead to their tomorrow.
Another life to hold you tight
Within the web it's weaving.
You're sad that you are leaving.
Its negative identity
Earth to be its name.
Wherein the germs of life are massed
So Earth began to form.
He who drinks the wine shall perish never.
He who understands the light within
Can now begin to know the reason.
Seeing his lasting peace upon the thunder
Clouds. A perfect dream in silence rides
And woe betides the poor believer.
He who sees the vision where his dream lies
Merely follows on towards the glow
As long ago he was commanded.
He who drinks the wine drinks to confusion.
The memories had begun to fade
Until the story was relayed
By someone whom I chanced to meet
Of what he'd seen of Ferris Street.
And so it was that I returned
To see the street that I had spurned
From Ferris Street where I was born.
A hundred years the wind has blown
The dust across the cobblestones.
It even blew their hopes aside
For here they stayed and here they died.
The stonework lying in the dust...
There's only me and the caresses
Of the waters of my brain
That rise and fall in me again
So my inadequacy shows
As I fight against the pain
On the bed where I have lain
Behind the charity charade
There lies the gleaming silver blade
That treats my body with disdain
That evermore it shall remain
To be amongst the fold again
And to no longer be insane
The search for the key to a life to succeed them
Which soon turns into sand.
A prayer to be borne on the wings of their blindness
A reason to cry at the moment of breaking
With nothing left at all...
Wishing for something the world is denying.
Someone to lean on and someone to trust.
To give or to take. To make or to break
Its gold and red and black display
Disappears and paves the way
For the pure white reflected light
Floating slowly across the spangled velvet screen
With no life to live.
Plods its lonely path into eternity
So contrast to the searing Sun
Taken in a wilderness
With no life to live.
Plods its lonely path into eternity
When your dreaming seems like ending
And you've nothing more to say
From the shelter of the silence
Then you take your last solution
In the twinkling of an eye
And you place it in your children's hands
That's when you lift it to the sun
And you don't see where it's landed
When your children's hands lie bleeding
You magnify your discontent
And you cannot let it pass.
So you take a stone in your good hand
And you throw it at the sky
And your cause is riding on that stone
That's when you lift it to the sun
And you don't see where it's landed
When your dreaming seems like ending
And you've nothing more to say
From the shelter of the silence
Then you take your last solution
In the twinkling of an eye
And you place it in your children's hands
That's when you lift it to the sun
And you don't see where it's landed
When your children's hands lie bleeding
You magnify your discontent
And you cannot let it pass.
So you take a stone in your good hand
And you throw it at the sky
And your cause is riding on that stone
That's when you lift it to the sun
And you don't see where it's landed
The rock that stood against the night
Its inorganic innocence
A lamp that led the little sister
The stave they placed within her hands
She held aloft above the stones
And fell as it was meant to be.
Could smile as in the last ascent
She stumbled on the hill.
And stemmed the tears behind her eyes.
Were bringing in the cirrus clouds
Its light the light that lives within.
The memory of any sin
Was taken on the smallest cloud
To thee my country I bequeath
Wherein the conquerors of schemes
That only can improve this life
Shall evermore be banned.
To thee my children I release
Thy spirit which is thine to keep
Until this land be wakened from
That it may never die.
To thee my brethren I request
That you may place the gift of time
That everyone might understand
And what a day this would be.
And what a day this would be.
As everything that man had touched he'd managed to degrade.
Leaving nothing to condemn and leaving nothing to forgive...
Yet this cannot protect them for like gossamer they hang.
All of the lakes lie still and waiting in the valleys of the strong.
To dwarf the rusty streets which lie below.
The heart that once was oak is dead
And buried by the iron plates
That cross the ribs of steel.
Cremated by the burning torch
And welded into steel.
Can hold the mountain hard and fast
To those themselves who must be held
Bolts of blue lightning burned the heart of the moon.
Whispering sounds that deaf ears could only desire.
Fading into nothing...
Kissing the future with its legends and its lies and its deceit.
Giving Joshua Jericho...
Out in the ether another sun began to rise.
He likes to keep ahead and has a hell of a tale.
He once came in a packet from Zanzibar
And steered his way home by the Northern Star...
He suffers from a war wound he will never discuss.
He caught it in the packet from Zanzibar
Where he steered his way home by the Northern Star...
And the clothes I wore were nothing more
I watched the seasons fly like a lullaby
That keeps you drowsy till the day you die
Both awake and in bed and if somebody said
And I learned to advance by the seat of my pants
And those that I passed were staggered how fast it was.
And I ran for miles past the trudging hordes
On an endless road over splintered boards
That slowed their feet but showed me how neat it was.
Through the roadway's end with a raging thirst
And a neon sign will show me how first it was.
And all that's left that's left alive
Will land at the end of a long low dive
And to all those who complain that his justice is unfair
The night the servant is punishing the dove.
As he drinks the blood
That they offer at the feast.
From high upon the hill into the depths he has sunk.
His cast and his Company have bundled up the trunk
They pray not for religion but they cry for the priest.
It's a bitter smoke that rises where only anger burns.
To lay before the beast
The changes from the Minster's spires
Draw soldiers in from encampment fires
By the light of every soldier's torch
The proclamation from the porch
Gives each his reason for debauch.
The streets within the fortress throng.
Laments from where their hearts belong.
The taverns there to take their gold
At early light the fortress gate
Is trundled open to await
The garrison becomes aware
The enemy is standing there...
Their horses on the street obey
And crush the skulls where still they lay
The Bishop's door at midnight groans.
The silver pieces and the bones.
I remember when the long ships sailed across the eastern sound
Toward the western skyline where the greenest hills are found.
And I remember when they stormed the cliffs along our jagged coasts
And the sentries in the villages who huddled at their posts
And didn't seem to know which way to go
Today began a thousand years ago.
And I remember when King Richard rode out on the great crusade.
A light of freedom shining from below.
Today began a thousand years ago.
Today began a thousand years ago.
Now the stones will tell their stories when the moss is peeled away.
The sun will shine as brightly when tomorrow is today.
But the flowers on the heath will always grow
Throughout the night of troubled sleep
Of gold and silver buried deep
Inside the clay outside the keep
Under the pillars of the gates of Prague.
Across a barren land he came
Until he saw upon a hill
A soldier trained to maim and kill
Guarding the pillars of the gates of Prague.
It took a lifetime to explain
But nothing moved the iron breast
And laughter echoed from the jest
Between the pillars of the gates of Prague.
There is no gold or silver leaf
Beneath the pillars of the gates of Prague.
Who found a royal crown at least
So scoffed the soldier at the gates of Prague.
The old man turned against the cold
Yet faster came his weary tread
When thinking what that soldier said
Beside the pillars of the gates of Prague.
The diadem that David crowned.
Burns for the Rabbi at the gates of Prague...
Blood streams from the nails on your fingers.
And you are on the outside
And I am on the inside and
And I am on the inside and
And you are on the outside
And I am on the inside and
And I am on the inside and
Shouting loud your long farewell should you not return again.
I didn't know you were alive and now I see you standing there.
You'd never be the one to die unless you had a reason to.
It's useless trying to get away when there are wolves among the trees.
Until you came in through that door and I can see you once again.
For those who live remember well the ones who wore the crimson star
The days of you and I.
Kiss me with your eyes.
Kiss me with your eyes.
If I reach out in my dreams
There are no goodbyes.
Kiss me with your eyes.
Don't give me goodbyes.
Through the web of tangled reason
There's nowhere in this prison
No doors or walls or windows
But I am walled inside...
And tears overflow on the sidewalks below
And the gutters are full.
And we work and work for money
Then someone runs out of ideas
And everyone gets fired.
And when you lose the feeling
And tears overflow on the sidewalks below
And the gutters are full.
So here's to the vultures
They're in everybody's way.
So please forgive this moment
That shines a light upon
The web of tangled reason
That keeps us keeping on...
And tears overflow on the sidewalks below
On the 14th night of April in the year of 1912
The North Atlantic sun had slowly drowned.
The orders which on taking watch they found.
The lookout Frederick Fleet did surely think
The ship that God himself could never sink.
For an endless 30 seconds she bore down upon the ice
Gliding on a mirror sea so cold it could entice
An iceberg of a hundred feet or more.
At 23 hours 40 by the watch.
And as the great Titanic's bow did surely start to dip
In disbelief from Andrews he did learn
The water in the bow had come too high.
Now out there on the ocean on this lonely freezing night
He learned his last command was doomed to die.
For looking round for lifeboats they saw relatively few
To carry off so many in the night.
Whilst the boats were launched and those who could did leave.
With scotch and soda flowing as the players asked for more
The widows in the boats began to grieve.
This April night when fifteen hundred died.
The saved could only sit and watch their husbands and their friends
Slip slow below the early morning tide.
The talented were hungry as they struggled to improve.
The talentless were quietly rehearsing every move
We all knew the part we had to play.
We all know the part we have to play.
We all knew the part we had to play.
And now the wind is blowing in the tragedy of death.
The cardboard castle still maintains the story of Macbeth.
Who knows not the part he has to play.
You cannot understand the funny feeling we were fools.
And they never know we are listening there.
Like blood on the cross on our old battlefield.
Came from our own Captain's gun.
Remembering Ginger and Albie and me.
But none of us ever joined up to be killed.
We volunteered proudly and died in our hosts.
Now armies of ageless battalions of ghosts
I listen to the songs you sing
Both written down and those unheard
They're always there to comfort me.
I listen to the songs you sing.
An ear you never can deceive.
Are played and heard a thousand times
In different ways by different minds
That ponder every word you say.
I listen to your music play.
The metronomes are keeping time
I listen to the songs you sing
Both written down and those unheard
They're always there to comfort me.
Trying to follow me...
Resolving to stand to defeat the unjust.
Trying to follow me...
As he rose to shake my hand and waved me onto his settee.
He laughed and showed those even teeth and eyes of smiling brown.
I'd like to know for number one the problems you perceive
And hardly had the Lord sat down than Christ came through the door.
But Dad and I and the Holy Ghost who we always keep outside
On the edges of silence somewhere in the rain
And the damp velvet drizzle there echoes again the dog.
From the white city mansions of high level sound
As the decibel pushes project once again the dog.
No loneliness greater than that which befell the dog.
Only the echoing whimpers remain
On the edges of silence somewhere in the rain
When that which we all rightly fear
Is first examined and revised
And neatly sanitized.
Strange how little filters past
The violence from the lens.
Stranger how restraint is urged
Where smell and hell are deftly purged
The filters come between.
It all must be written before it's too late.
The half of my memory that can't concentrate
The tied paw of the red setter or
The wide jaw of the fed heifer or
The tried law of the sled fetter or
The side door of the bred debtor or
I'm sure it's one of these.
So forgive my confusion if I talk aloud
In training the powers of which I am proud.
The tied paw of the red setter or
The wide jaw of the fed heifer or
The tried law of the sled fetter or
The side door of the bred debtor or
I'm sure it's one of these.
In thereby remembering all of your needs.
The tied paw of the red setter or
The wide jaw of the fed heifer or
The tried law of the sled fetter or
The side door of the bred debtor or
The fried claw of the dead leper or
The fighting began after hours of waiting
Ready and willing to move on the order
The message came over the line.
I nearly feel really alive.
I nearly feel really alive
Now the order to go has arrived.
No calculation for when I am older.
The battle is raging and I am the soldier
With only a moment to go.
With only a moment to go
The overtures herald the show.
The orders command and I shall...
The orders command and I shall
Head on down the canal.
Affirms my position and worth...
Affirms my position and worth...
The oppressing silence weighing down
Makes sleep an impossible dream.
I vaguely hear the cars passing by through the dull damp air
Suspended in my limbo.
So I must occupy my mind.
I vaguely hear the church clock chiming its regular chime
I would hear except that a merciful unconsciousness
But those who follow in my steps
Across the frozen winter ground.
The echo of their clarion sound
Is deafening my ears.
The quickened pulse and gasping breath
My blood is pure adrenalin.
Across the day the hunter moves
As close behind the flailing hooves
Still thunder in my wake.
And so it is these towering trees
Salute the one about to fall.
The mist is growing colder now.
The running eyes and gasping breath
Are quickened in the jaws of death
That slaver as they bay
And they were there in their summer clothes
And the dancing shoes took to the high roads
They were all the same whether they were from
And they were there in their summer clothes
But do what you're wanting to do.
You know the land on your right
And the land on your left hand
But see what you're wanting to see.
You know the sea and the sand
That you see on your right hand
And call what you're wanting to call.
You know the sun up in the blue
And the moon up on the black sky
The sun and the moon that you're holding in between and
With the cold eye of the soldier and
The cold hand of the surgeon and
The cold and calculating mind of
I walk along the city street
But they can never pierce the heart
And kill the way a deftly wielded
For words will never make you bleed
But that was when my uniform
When my words so clear
And dripped into the waiting ear
Another fool had found defeat
And still my hands were soft and
Even sweet inside the glove that played
The drumsticks on the soft and kind.
It took the military mind
To sentence silence as the blind
A hundred of them gone since darkness fell.
The messenger was looking out for someone he could trust
And the dark remained unbroken in the early hours of day
As vainly on the highway he did search
Until a chink of light appeared to point itself his way
Was still the door that framed the flickering light.
But if you will confide in me I'll see what can be done
And suddenly the courtyard was alight with blazing flares.
The Prince that he had served so faithfully
Though proud will be the tale of how you came.
And everybody learns it
And there's no room for cruelty in Haiti.
From the green of the mountains
From the chain and the collar
To that final severed hand
And there's no room for cruelty in Haiti.
And she carries the elite
And there's no room for cruelty in Haiti.
Forget about the justice
That is long overdue.
And it really might be true
That it's a blue horizon upon a Caribbean Sea
And there's no room for cruelty in Haiti.
And everybody learns it
When something or someone gave me the idea
To write down the words that turned into the song
Called The Rocking Machine...
Where the salt of the earth will return from the sea
To the land from which it was driven of old...
Glide like a fish on the floor of the sea.
To the Rocking Machine...
Where the salt of the earth will return from the sea
To the land from which it was driven of old...
Think as you've never considered before.
When you find the key you will open the door
To the Rocking Machine...
Sombre decisions will take on the guise
Of simple pronouncements of what you believe.
In the Rocking Machine...
Where the salt of the earth will return from the sea
To the land from which it was driven of old.
Where the salt of the earth will return from the sea
The mists are always swirling
Where the castle wall is cold.
The night is not for dreamers
For they cannot escape from
In fear or frustration
All the discontented crews
Gather in the glowing
And there are no surprises
Finding they themselves accused before The Wall.
Unmatched in unimportance
Crackling with images
The paradox is heightened
There is no need to advertise upon The Wall.
But they cannot pierce my makeup
Or break up my disguise.
They mate me with their flies.
They took your picture
Close beside the classical illusions they've collected.
They took your number
Hung between the mythical and puzzles they've neglected.
They took your address
Hard against the library of cards they have selected.
How hard the mighty fall from their pinnacles of fame
When we and our friends push them over.
On the throne sits another King.
As they fight for the right to be King.
In the night for our power and glory.
They're as true as they ever have been...
On the throne sits another King...
The cook sent the lad from the galley informing
The fires had died and the ovens were cold.
The Fires of St. Elmo so freely bestowed
Did sweep through her sails and dance in her rigging.
We all are dancing like there is no end.
Burning bright no matter how fast the dances play.
We all are dancing through a purple sky
And when the world is but a memory that's past and gone
We all are dancing little points of light
We will be dancing on and on and on.
When you describe the sun
Not in the words you use
But in the way your smiling eyes convey the meaning.
When you discuss the stars
Not in the words you use
But in the way you hold your cloak about your body.
And love is appreciation
And understanding of value.
When you describe the cold
Not in the words you use
But in the way your face reflects the warmth within you.
When you discuss the night
Not in the words you use
But in the way the rain is falling on your window.
And love is appreciation
And understanding of value.
When you describe the world
Not in the words you use
But in the way we sing our tuneless songs together.
When you discuss your dreams
Not in the words you use
But in the way you know no fear when you awaken.
And love is appreciation
The earth beneath the surface dust
Is cold and damp and raw
Can almost be forgiven
For remembering the dream
Of the wall of stones around the homes
The carriers with their loads
Were leaving for the northern towns
And also leaving far behind
The plague of London town.
George Vicars was the tailor
And to his house a case of clothes
From London town was seen
To be delivered one fine day
And never more was tailor Vicars
The scars upon his face and chest
And from the bell upon the church
The knell of death was rung.
Buried in their graves
As Thomas Stanley stood above
The differences between the men
That were so very wide
Were shattered by the desperate need
And rudely cast aside.
The forces of the two were joined.
Their words were not in vain.
Agreed to stay and die.
But high enough that they should know
The plague must stay behind the wall
For six long months the wall did stand
Never more were heard.
All buried in the ground.
The Coopers and the Vicars
Never made another sound.
The dawn that rang the final bell
The villagers rebuilt their lives
With those who still remained.
A certain modicum of fame.
The much reported legacy
As left to her by Aunt Marie
The swirling dust around the feet
Of children playing in the street
Was swirling round the rubber wheels
Around the supermarket door
Where left for not a second more
Than takes the strength the stranger lacks
To break the thread that holds her back.
With something to be living for.
To satisfy the crying need
Commit the crime that the police
They took the child and in its place
They left a feeling of disgrace.
Beckoned through the leaded panes
Standing silent on the stones
Without recourse to bit or reins.
All the jewels flashed together.
There upon the stones lay strewn
A hundred ears of golden grain.
Once again now tight secured.
The other three behind their leader
Confident in life assured.
Lanterns to dispel the gloom
Lit the loaves and sacks of grain
Echoes of the drunken laughter
Coming from the room.
Naked in the freezing night.
Disappearing out of sight.
Now the ship of state is sailing
On a cold tempestuous sea.
She's far out on the ocean
And she's crewed by you and me.
And we haul on the mainsail halyard
The billowed sails are quickly reefed
And no one tells us why.
And he will never tell us
That our fate is in the hand
We've sailed for seven years
And only ocean have we seen
And the singing of the rigging
But we never heard a word
And now the sun is rising
And we gaze upon the yardarm
And then we turn and see his face.
The silk and gold and lace
And the light shines all around him
And then he points a blinding finger
As the oil below the ocean
Forms a fountain in the sky
A believable tango on the roadway to France
Out of the windows of the Bristol Museum.
The handles that power the stately machines
Are held by the killers who sweep the latrines.
The rows of medallions that hang on the chest
His jeep and his driver the law contravene
A Bavarian accent intoning commands
The motorboat complement never got through.
Untainted by the clink of ice
But side by side with scent of spice
Came poems from the flashing pen.
The wine was sweeter then.
The longer summers went their way
To sing a drunken roundelay
To sing the poem once again
With gaiety remembering when
The skies were bluer then.
The firelight flickers playing games
Went dancing on the window panes
As winter's daylight slowly wanes.
And shadows that are soft and warm
Kept flickering as they performed
Mazurkas in the winter's night.
The fire flickers bright.
For something somewhere lingers on
That conjured by nostalgia's wand
From pastures where the grass grew high
And green within the memories eye.
Were soaked by the deluge of rain.
The neon and sodium lights reflected brightly from the polished pavements.
With no movement save that of the rain itself
And then the rats came.
They came from the sewers that overflowed
The main thoroughfares and the precincts
All were filled with the scurrying of feet
And the dull sound of the rain hammering
On and on they came to take shelter and to feed
At the feet of Christ who hung upon the cross
And here in their hundreds of thousands they ate
And having done so slipped away into the night
Unchanged except to those whose early journey
Took them past the Church of the Sacred Heart
And who noticed in passing that the eyes of the hanging Christ
Like she'll never sing again.
In the crystal cold of dawn
She will sing her lonely tune.
The truck there on the skyline was waiting to explode
As angels sang in harmony on our side of the road.
Found Negroes in the woodpile with keys to all their locks.
Encouraged those with aerosols to turn their pressure can.
Both through a sense of justice and also being shy.
The desolate Commander who sees his force has flown
To ultimate dimensions far greater than they knew
Studying the Sergeant and peering down his throat.
Trying to find the secrets that the shoreline tries to hide.
The exercise is futile if your face is turning blue.
I watched him stick his neck out and I judged the end results.
The sickness in the hospital was carefully detailed.
Stands beneath the interchange the engineers have made.
As quietly I drove my car across the soldier's eyes.
But with a cry of victory that nothing else could bring
The butcher stole the audience and turned his veins to string.
Always makes the surgery a second before me.
His words possess a beauty in the way that they prescribe...
The monkeys in the circus up on the high trapeze
Come flying through the spotlight to where the safety net
Catches all the ashes from the monkey's cigarette.
The shining Iron Maiden with her undemanding games
Plays with anybody but will never ask their names
The doorman bows politely in his mink and ermine suit.
He passes out the papers the visitors must see
But carefully disguises the copies on his knee.
Became condemned for breathing and the creaking of my shoes.
Seeks to disassociate the eunuch in the fold.
In deference to the wishes of those that he defiled.
To dwarf the rusty streets which lie below.
The heart that once was oak is dead
And buried by the iron plates
That cross the ribs of steel.
Cremated by the burning torch
And welded into steel.
Can hold the mountain hard and fast
To those themselves who must be held
Yet this cannot protect them for like gossamer they hang.
All of the lakes lie still and waiting in the valleys of the strong.
Bolts of blue lightning burned the heart of the moon.
Whispering sounds that deaf ears could only desire.
Fading into nothing...
Kissing the future with its legends and its lies and its deceit.
Giving Joshua Jericho...
Out in the ether another sun began to rise.
It has passed as the vein that brings the blood
It is yours. Is the mine so full of gold
Can you not see there is something there for you...
Now the time draws the closing of my day and of yours.
That it has gone and that you are next to go
So slow the whip will lash.
So high will fly the bluebird.
So far as I can tell.
So high will fly the bluebird.
So strange to be so young.
So high will fly the bluebird.
So strange to be so young.
So high will fly the bluebird.
So slow the whip will lash.
It's the depth of the winter and out of the darkness
An eye that is streaming that snow has blown into
For friends who look forward and friends who remember.
The fire once that flared is now but an ember
And some of us wander the valley of shadows
And as yesterday's hero lies deep in the sand
It's the death of an old year as I leave the station
Erupting in fire. And over the wire
The orbit of the oranges as down upon his knees
The light plays with the images that everybody sees
As higher in the night they fly with ever growing ease
To Lenin in his frozen tomb.
The talent and the genius that now accepts the rose
To kneel and never more to search.
Now crystal chandeliers reflect on walls of inlaid gold
The ruby stars are shining and like Bethlehem of old
He was maybe too stupid or even too proud.
He talked of his life and of people he'd known.
He told of the things his experience had shown.
It seemed to get lost in the circular smoke
And silence was bought in the passage of time.
And the wolves on the hills howled for the forsaken
Stood shackled and shambling and nailed to the vine
Like old friends of mine.
When criminal corporals stood spitting out pips.
And the rain pounded down on a sergeant whose dreaming
Seemed only to stretch to the stutter and screaming
From the smile on his lips.
All the mirth and the mercy in slumber were sleeping
Lie drowned in the sound of the blue lightning leaping
Out from the dark of the Judge's blue eyes
That all mercy defies.
So the circus parades in its bells and its leather.
Its clowns and its jugglers ride the trapeze.
And all that is heard is the buzz of the bees
In their high galleries.
A few weighted words in the balance of trade.
On the solid gold statues and the dirges they muttered.
The rooks and the ravens stayed hard to define
I salted the earth with a handful of beans
And planted them out on the ledge.
All the way down the line what's mine is mine.
I give of the wine when the choirboys ask
For hammering down on the wedge
All the way down the line what's mine is mine.
To ring for the future and all it foretells.
The chimes clatter over the edge.
All the way down the line what's mine is mine.
With all of the good and the evil they bring.
They all join the carol to chorus and sing
All the way down the line what's mine is mine.
An unclear recollection and a memory that seems
To be carved on the sky and to float on the sea
But when rhetoric ends in a silent decree
Then Gabriel turns on me.
The softest caress of my partner in crime
Explains to the furtherest limits of mime
Is lost when a pipe falls and shatters its knee
As Gabriel turns on me...
It's taken outside and nailed to a tree.
He leaves it suspended for morning to see
Then Gabriel turns on me.
Return from the fires where forever they burn.
They'll squeak and they'll squirm as perception degrades
To explode in your eyes like a hundred grenades.
This treacherous torment of constant charades
Wherever the firelight fades...
With their bayonets fixed and their rifles at the slope.
The daughters and the sons fly the planes and fire the guns
March along to the beat of the drum
Through the mud and through the rain. Will you ever see again
The broken youth and the battle burns.
There are words of sympathetic pride
And memorials to those who died...
Excepting for the few for whom the bugle blew
The broken youth and the battle burns.
There are words of sympathetic pride
And memorials to those who died...
Excepting for the few for whom the bugle blew
Their status encased in a Mercedes Beast.
Where the poor find it harder to scream.
You could say to a man they know what it's like
To swirl in a poverty mist
And why the poor find it hard to resist.
Where the poor find it harder to breathe.
But I want no part of the empires built
On a patch with a permanent seep
And where the poor find it harder to sleep.
Samaritans all pass you by
Where the poor find it easier to die.
Their status encased in a Mercedes Beast.
As midnight kissed a sighing Singapore.
Of spluttering champagne
And let the wind have all that it reveals.
Let the whispered silver
She's seen the sky and now she needs her comb.
Take me back to Raffles
I smile into the camera's eye from underneath the light.
For I have never contemplated opening that silver door
Whilst in the dark that silver door is glowing brighter than before
As I look out past the studio lights I know I am alone.
When they come in the night with their lamps burning bright
The cries burrow deep to the depths of my sleep
Of the roots being wrenched from the clay.
In the darkness I turn away.
The Baptists are easy to find.
At the point of a gun they force them to run
And they leave not a one left behind.
In its lightness I am blind.
When they scour the lanes and find the remains
The word and the word disappears.
But I cannot decipher what
Out late on the street I hear on its beat
The growl of a Doberman dog.
The red of its eyes destroys my disguise
As slowly it searches the smog.
They cast adrift this useless cog
In company so often seen
It takes an act of charity
For your serving grace
Your energies are cracked and dry
Yet somehow always force the pace.
But somewhere there's a saving grace...
There's a saving grace.
And yet is somehow lightly laced
With something really quite absurd.
You turn and as you slowly fall
The diamond that has turned to paste
Becomes your saving grace.
So the tidal flow will come and go
And images you will replace.
Out there in the open space.
For temples tall and all will fall
Will I float high and free without earth to bind
And so these wings will carry me
There to land on the sand and be sleeping still
And so these wings will carry me
There to land on the sand and be sleeping still
There to land on the sand and be sleeping still
Battened down the memories
The purple veins across his cheeks
The Eskimo had settled down
His rifle and his crucifix
He tied and tethered to his fears.
Had perished in the frozen mire.
He'd learned the hunter's homily
The peasant squatted in the mud
His lifted eyes and leather lines
Appeasing every gathered cloud.
The sun bled through the thorns and said
So we became discourteous.
The peasants and the sailors and
The hunters and the rest of us
Took aim as they approached the flame
Uncle Joe crossed the northern river.
Uncle Joe had searched for silver.
Time and again had he been jailed.
Uncle Joe was at the end of the line.
He would never own a silver mine
Then he went to the river and he dipped his pan
With riches that remain untold.
And God blessed Uncle Joe.
One minute he was a poor man
And then he looked into his pan.
He saw his future clear and bright.
He celebrated hard that night.
God blessed Uncle Joe.
He bought a departmental store.
He bought a railway company.
He wanted all the world to see
How God blessed Uncle Joe.
And no one mourned on his funeral day
That Uncle Joe had passed away.
And God blessed Uncle Joe.
Now I don't know if Joe made a will
In a golden coffin he does lie.
The river is running dry.
Talking of the avalanche will surely bring it down
Trying to break the embrace of the Oyster and the Pearl.
The flashlight finds the darkness in the doorway and reveals
A casual acquaintance of the Oyster and the Pearl...
When the history committee meets to draft its treasury
They'll mean absolutely nothing to the Oyster and the Pearl.
They'll reduce his double helix to a sagging crinkled curl.
Nobody gets the picture but the Oyster and the Pearl...
Will only give you ulcers
If you find your heart is beating
Don't let them take you away.
Don't let them take you away.
Don't let them take you away.
Not even for a day...
And try to look upon the bright side
Of your hypertension.
Don't let them take you away.
Don't let them take you away.
Don't let them take you away.
Not even for a day...
Are they murmuring your name
Whilst the monitor is beeping
There is no one grimly reaping.
Don't let them take you away.
Don't let them take you away.
Don't let them take you away.
Not even for a day...
Or in the cardiac unit.
With a modicum of good advice
To take your time and take it easy.
Don't let them take you away.
Don't let them take you away.
Don't let them take you away.
Not even for a day...
Don't let them take you away.
Don't let them take you away.
The masks are worn on summer nights
When the young are dancing.
The masks are worn on summer nights
When the dance is young.
Behind her mask a princess dreams
Behind her mask a princess dreams
Of some other song...
Where the street musician's music played
To the streets where no one seeks to ask
The masks which hide a thousand eyes
The masks which hide a thousand eyes
And all their tears...
And the street musician's music played
To the streets where no one seeks to ask
I watched the protagonists stumble across
The field of bright diamonds and hills of white moss.
On the shadowy mountain they'd lighted upon.
But all their temptations were listed and learned
Whose silence is simply a stain of conceit
It's what you expect and it's what you deserve
From all of your servants and those you're called to serve.
Remember the tallow you burned in the night
And the strength from your muscles that ebbed by the hour
Keep an eye to the future that settles your fate.
See you fill in the spaces between every shred
Of remaining ideas on which you have been fed.
But don't plead for bandage to cover the hint
Guarded by the Deacon.
Down along the dusty road
The stagecoach is expected.
Nothing is neglected...
With the grinding wheels and rattling chains
Sweat of hours driving.
Through the gate the Coachman wheels
To halt below the lamplight
To hand the plate in to the church
Upon the stroke of midnight.
Refusing all assistance.
And when the lamps upon the coach
The Deacon leads his saddled horse
From where it has been tethered.
Upon its back the chest is tied
As minutes tick past midnight.
The Deacon climbs up on the mare
The wind begins it banging.
And from the chapel gallery
Cradling his Kalashnikov and polishing his Gatling gun...
Polishing his Gatling gun.
Friends will sit and tell their tales to anyone who wants to hear
Of puppetry and power and the rattle of the musketeer...
The rattle of the musketeer.
Flashing to celestial trumpets backed by a thousand steel guitars.
Here's where the ghostly angels play their games of solitaire
You really are too cold to care.
This icy wind from way up North will petrify whatever breathes.
A blast that howls through every pore is stripping bare the summer leaves.
Relentlessly the tree of life is rising through the acid rain.
The things you've done throughout the day can once again be seen.
And flashing through your mind will come a pattern...
This is your dream... this is your dream...
The highlights of your day are filtered through from way down deep
The world of fantasy within the framework of your brain
And flashing through your mind will come a pattern...
This is your dream... this is your dream...
To gather more material by living through the day
And flashing through your mind will come a pattern...
A gypsy with a heart of gold
Knowing the trinkets that he sold
Is grateful even to be fed
A little from the hands of the
And Wonders of the World.
Agreeing as indeed he should
His wealth should see the plates of the Guardians.
The day he lost the will to fight
And cast it in the palms of the
And Wonders of the World.
Left spinning still and wondering how
The sap that climbs to every bough
Is salted for the sake of the Guardians.
Not only how but also why
The dust blanketing the eye of the
And Wonders of the World.
Over the leaves now tinged with brown.
Over the leaves now tinged with brown.
Fly to the south where the sun still beckons
From behind the eye of the mind.
Wings that lift them into the sunrise
Wings that lift them into the sunrise
Up to the cold of the morning air
From behind the eye of the mind.
Some will fall below their comrades
Some will fall below their comrades
From behind the eye of the mind.
Will light in the dust of his summer home
Hanging from the slender silken threads
Are tiny jingling bells
That you hear as you venture near
The water chimes bewitching sounds
Sail on a sympathetic tune
Between the mountains and the moon
As they play through the night and the day
Through the misty clouds.
And across the streams of melody
The crashing cymbals crash into eternity...
Listen to the ringing bells appeal
With all that they reveal
As chimes reflect the times
Through the misty clouds.
And across the streams of melody
The crashing cymbals crash into eternity...
Listen to the ringing bells appeal
With all that they reveal
As chimes reflect the times
They tell me there is nothing that can't be bought or sold.
Nothing that you can't convert into a pot of gold.
Somewhere on the trail
In Harvard and in Yale
You really cannot fail.
The hookers out on Broadway and the ladies of Des Moines
Offer up a platter of their tasty tenderloin.
As plain there in the makeup as it is MacDonald's fries.
The very thing you love is the thing you most despise
Coming at you through the mail
The words are inscribed as the stories are told.
And so we explain what lies under the stone.
Let Y be the question and X the unknown.
Let light fall upon us
And there with the flock as I listened and heard
I stood and relinquished
That faith is belief that is tempered with need.
Faith is belief that is tempered with need.
Please stand while the jury is told of the charge.
In the act and in charge of original thought.
These fancies are worse than the sins of the flesh.
It was George Bernard Shaw that he'd looked to embrace.
Of proving my lack of original thought.
He'd tell of the brand new embalming technique
My client was seeking the day he was caught.
This was nothing to do with original thought.
And those that can risk undermining the State.
Has had an original thought in his life.
I humbly submit to this merciful Court
The tears of the jury were flowing and free.
This is the moment to stand up and say
That nothing has shown we should lock him away.
And we on the jury are pleased to report
He never has had an original thought.
He never has had an original thought.
That everything comes by design.
So many like Machiavelli believe
That no price is ever too high.
The patriot never asks why.
So there in a clearing on midsummer's eve
I offer to die for the things they believe.
And something we've known all along.
Is ever conceivably wrong.
We're grateful for what we're about to receive.
Defending imposing our creed.
I think I'll apply for compassionate leave...
The dust is unacceptable
And the ancient bus is coughing
As it splutters up the hill.
And buzzards wheel and wait
For all the animals to die.
The scene moves to the mountain top
From the left and from the right
Are passed along down passageways
Info packs for the hungry hacks
And the waiting party troops.
They talk of how the failing rains
Have been getting out of hand
And of regret they haven't yet
Produced the Promised Land.
The steepness of that hill
And of the rush there is to push
Their Transportation Bill.
They ask me how it feels.
I say I think they're missing out
That maybe they should take a glance
At the buzzards in the sky.
They shake my hand and say
I've been a really helpful guy.
So we offer up our precious votes
With all those hopes and dreams.
Or that's the way it seems.
When once they used to lead.
Yet the dust is unexplainable
Though the air is deathly still.
The ancient bus still coughs
And struggles gamely on the hill.
Across a frightened sky.
The buzzards wheel and wait
His is a story of men who were heroes
But wouldn't have seen it that way.
It began with the news of a ship in distress
That ship came around and then ran aground
But no one knew then what eight lifeboat men
Were paying so dearly for.
It was 7.29 on the 17th March
The Coastguard had put in the call.
The storm had been rated a vicious Force Nine
With waves that were sixty foot high.
The lifeboat set out to defy.
As she had done so often before.
We know that she battled through fifty knot winds
For a full ninety minutes or more.
She disappeared into the night.
Seven of the lifeboat men still at their posts
But all of them sadly had drowned.
Capsized in the night's long ordeal.
The Cox was still strapped to the wheel.
The father of John and of Dan.
She took with her every man.
Lifeboat men doing their job.
So this is the story of men who were heroes
That began with the news of a ship in distress
The ship came around and then ran aground
But no one knew then what eight lifeboat men
I feel reassured and you could say relieved
In patrolling the paths that the martyrs have trod
He's fortunately mastered the thinking of God.
How often the Lord and His servant agree.
At least till they've mastered the thinking of God.
Addresses and readings and Sermons on Mounts
Safely convince us it's our God that counts.
Excepting of course for that poor little sod
Who hasn't quite mastered the thinking of God.
To someone who's mastered the thinking of God.
For those who'll untangle what can't be explained.
You are what you are and it's all you will be
While the Chaplain still blesses the firing squad.
But all that he had was a mangy old goat
And he went to a friend who heard his appeals
And a sailor man suddenly pricked up his ears.
Then an old friend from Chinatown came to his aid.
Was guaranteed over a million sales.
But each of them had to be copied by hand.
In Victorian times of malodorous drains.
We'll never know whether it was fortune or fate
Brought Alex G. Bell stepping up to the plate.
A remarkable thing he'd pulled out of the box
And guaranteed finally to sort out the pox.
He whispered it quietly over the line
It's a long twisting road. There are turnings and bends
But believe it or not I have many more friends
With a million ideas. They're keen and they're mean
And still as inventive as they've ever been.
With thoughts and ideas that will truly astound.
The Rolling Stones had opened and the Beatles were in tears.
To countless fans around the world and never falling short
Stars of television and of course the silver screen.
The audience was in their palm in seven seconds flat.
They even had Madonna with them in a backup role.
The Trotter Sisters shifted up and out of cruise control...
The rubber hood in Hollywood the night they played the Bowl.
But everybody seemed to like the dog that got its bone
The Trotter Sisters finally withdrew from the applause.
Despite all of appearances no animals were harmed.
All the way down to the Cape
On a Union Castle ship.
Mary looked for a brand new life
Which finally she found
Some way into the hinterland
On a patch of broken ground.
She cried into the rain.
She knew that she would never see
But a new world waited out across
Of adventures and intrigues.
Through hot and dusty summers
When every bluster made her feel
When fever struck and crops had failed
Still Mary raised a family
And somehow she survived.
They moved her from that patch of land
To leave her dispossessed.
She found another just the same
A few miles to the west.
She took it on the chin.
She'd never given in.
She never made the trip
Back to the port of Liverpool
On a Union Castle ship.
When a frail voice cracked through.
I guess it's always been the same
And should you ever raise your eyes
It's a controversial thing to say
But I'm going to say it anyway.
The quest for which must never cease
A peace that's bad can be worse than war.
No road to peace is a single track.
It's vulnerable to attack
Chanting mantras makes you blind
To everything that's gone before.
A peace that's bad can be worse than war.
Cast your mind back to Versailles.
Fifty million had to die
For that was where the seeds were sown
But a peace that's bad can be worse than war.
Peace that's seen to be unjust
Fuels conflict and distrust.
Grenades left lying in the road
Are always waiting to explode.
A peace that's bad can be worse than war.
I'd guess that it would take two hands
To make a register of those
This is what we answer for.
A peace that's bad can be worse than war.
That old men speak and young men die.
To parley for a breathing space
Someone has to keep the score.
A peace that's bad can be worse than war.
This isn't new. It's history.
Someone else out on a limb.
A peace that's bad can be worse than war.
This is what we answer for.
Sometimes it's quite Kafkaesque
And they couldn't be keener
Arrives on the Editor's desk.
That's when the skeletons dance.
At the end of the day
That's when the skeletons dance.
A Minister has to explore
That's when the skeletons dance.
At the end of the day
That's when the skeletons dance.
And now you are beaten
That's when the skeletons dance.
At the end of the day
That's when the skeletons dance.
You're deserving of all you will get
That's when the skeletons dance.
At the end of the day
That's when the skeletons dance.
You must keep it under your hat
At the end of the day
At the end of the day
The winds caress the mountain top
And every day it rains
Each day a thousand grains
The mountain disappears.
It's gone before the world awakes
And little by little is all it takes.
The frog can be forgiven if
For certainly his trust has been
How easily that little frog
Is brought up to the boil.
And little by little is all it takes.
They say that Adolph Hitler once
Not if they are taken
In a thousand tiny shards.
But then he can't apply the brakes.
And reassured my mobile phone
And by the great benevolence
Of those whom we anoint.
Made a very valid point.
For little by little is all it takes...
And I know that he had a tattoo on his neck.
But I can only tell you what I've said to the press.
His hair was all straggly and it got in the way.
I think it was maybe that stupid tattoo.
It's really turned into one hell of a mess.
It was like a red star and it grew by degrees
They used DNA and they looked at his teeth.
And he'd look up and down and he'd shuffle his feet.
But I can only tell you what I've said to the press.
And a guy up in his conning tower
Who's always speaking truth to power.
It matters little who says what
And that hope will be the last to die.
So the property tycoon acquired
The graveyard of the uninspired.
But probably his greatest trick
Was playing the body politic
Till everyone was in cahoots.
The building blocks that underlie
Why hope will be the last to die.
And maybe that's a reason why
Hope will be the last to die.
Conspiring like a Devil's bride.
Demand will always beat supply
But hope will be the last to die.
Everything can be exchanged.
I think that that was Thomas Paine.
Just close your eyes and sing along.
As the storms fell upon us and the maelstrom swirled.
Everybody quickly realigning their sights
Reminded me of Moses and those Israelites
Believing they were leaving all the plagues behind.
There's nothing like an optimistic state of mind
Who pays the ferryman
Let me think a minute...
We ducked and dissembled when the venom flew forth
And all that we're asking as we gird up our loins
To see us to safety and across the abyss.
Who pays the ferryman
Let me think about it...
Democracy always being greatly admired.
Nobody resisted irresistible force.
Who pays the ferryman
The night out there was blacker than Lucifer's soul.
Those who had the pennies were all waiting to cross.
Repenting at leisure for their indecent haste.
Who pays the ferryman
Who pays the ferryman
When all is said and done...
Came a butterfly's scream...
He kicked the dog that kept on getting underneath his feet.
We're back to all the good times and the old days in Berlin
Of a butterfly's scream.
It's best for you if we assume your hearing's on the blink.
In around about an hour from now the roadway will be clear
That swept out through and past the Gerrymander Street blockade.
It all comes down to balancing on both sides of the beam
When butterflies scream...
There surely was never a worthier call.
For someone with tact and discretion in spades.
The pox doctor's clerk.
Went into the booklet that served me so well.
They'd sally so sheepishly in through the door
His Worship the Mayor was a notable first.
A lady I'd known from an earlier time
Had techniques that verged on the truly sublime.
Metaphorically kicked his balls out of the park
The pox doctor's clerk.
It would be remiss for me here to disclose
The matter resolved diplomatically when
The Cabinet Secretary called Number Ten.
Had cause to remember the pox doctor's clerk...
The pox doctor's clerk.
Here in the Department of Foreign Affairs
We all have a maxim that each of us shares.
We understand Ministers must make their mark.
It can't have been more than a minute or so
Before he returned with the choir in tow.
There must have been forty or fifty or more
And each of them had their own personal score.
Some tell how the sound made the angels rejoice.
The choir was truly in wonderful voice.
And though we agree that we might intercede
Alas we can't claim to be wholly immune
How often we reap from the seeds that we sow.
It wasn't the sound of the bar being trashed
That finally persuaded the Lance Bombardier
To get up and get off of his knees.
That's what he remembered...
That's what he recalled...
The service was something secure.
For a second and then a third tour.
They'd put that in his dossier.
That's what he remembered...
That's what he recalled...
And found him a way to survive.
Just one of them made it alive.
And crushed some significant nerve
Was medically unfit to serve.
That's what he remembered...
That's what he recalled...
And all that remained was a shirt on his back
And the ribbons he steadfastly wore.
That's what he remembered...
That's what he recalled...
Had pushed himself onto TV.
And nobody would disagree
The legend he wanted to be.
That's what he remembered...
That's what he recalled...
Then an inquest was called on a dearly departed
The life boatmen pulled from the waves.
And of course how the media behaves.
And that's what the court record showed
That's what was remembered...
Where grandpa once saw Buffalo Bill in 1892.
Crash Donovan appearing with his Motorcycle Show.
The champion that no one ever managed to remove.
With Billy revving hard and standing high on the machine.
Then a silence fell. The engine snarled. The Tiger gathered speed
As everybody hoped he'd have the impetus he'd need.
To everyone's surprise above the tumult of the throng
A roaring came from deep within that blazing stack of straw.
No one there that night had come prepared for what they saw.
Security is paramount. Orders are unsealed.
His hand moved to his mouth and he popped a Benzedrine.
Skittered tales of armaments and altitude and time.
The fireball arriving above the speed of sound.
Those who've walked along this path and seen it all before
Sitting on the tinder box and trying not to start
The Matron is busy connecting the wires.
She smiles in the way that so often they do
When they know that a treatment is long overdue.
It seems it defies all applicable laws
It's the nightmare... the nightmare...
When you're sleepwalking into a parallel zone
And biting down hard on that suicide pill.
We're all here and with you to carry the weight.
And that's all that anyone ever can say.
She fixes his fetters and shackles his wrists
And wipes off the sweat of his brow on her sleeve.
Believe at all costs that we're getting it right
For some it's worth trying defying the odds
The sunlight be lost to the shivering cold
Of the nightmare... the nightmare...
The sunlight be lost to the shivering cold
I said to Genghis Khan once in the thirteenth century.
That winter night in Dresden back in 1945.
This time there was absolutely no necessity.
Bhopal seemed a likely place to try some new techniques.
And so the story of my life unveils its twists and turns.
I interest myself in many different concerns
And where I can I try to keep disruption to the max.
I'm grateful to the many who have helped along the way
In running up the debt that no one ever will repay.
We went out in search of whatever remained.
When we knew beyond doubt we had killed The Idea.
That something descended from somewhere in space.
For possible traces of after effect.
As a Notion that nobody ever could mind.
But something important had happened that day.
Into different shapes that were harder to shift.
Of the Sentiment seeming so chillingly clear.
Back with a new and compelling belief.
Through can't and corruption and everyday lies.
Something was surely about to arise.
His wife and his daughters were raped and then killed
And blood ran in rivers wherever it spilled.
And finally left him for dying or dead.
He finally made it to sparser terrain
From the mass executions and the genocide rapes
Always avoiding the frontier posts.
The refugees searched in the local bazaars
For clothing to hopefully cover their scars.
And that's where they came across owners of boats
Highly conveniently left undefined...
The vessel set out to a freshening breeze.
It's even worth paying a black marketeer
When sheer desperation is all you can find
In the dark and the deep of a crucified mind.
Day upon day spent appeasing their Lord
As dead and as dying were thrown overboard.
But somehow the vessel still kept them afloat
A military plane passing high to the west
Sent out a message to detain and arrest.
She landed them up on a faraway coast
Where men in dark glasses were looking askance
At the desolate outcasts who'd taken their chance.
And counted them in by a kerosene lamp.
Stories about an elaborate charade
And how many migrants were being betrayed.
The Illegal got lucky this once in his life.
The instinct he'd so much depended upon
It seemed by the earliest glimmer of light
The Illegal was literally fading from sight.
Maybe the strings are growing old now.
Maybe the guitar's lost its ring.
Maybe the fingers are growing old now.
Maybe the voice has lost its ring.
Maybe the throat is growing dry now.
Maybe the shadows are growing long now.
Maybe the seasons dulled the string.
Maybe the harmony lies broken.
Poor old thing... poor old thing.
Even the last elusive ring
Seeming to wend away for ever.
It shakes me on the phone
Friends shine down like stars
I need to know I'm home
And plays with my skin
Happiness flickers like a flame
Hold on a while longer
And shade in all the doubt
Tales just get taller
I will not go without...
You caught me out today
I was looking the other way
But knew it was all too late
You can't take the hat
You can't bring up love
When we're in this state
You caught me out today
I was looking the other way
As the words would make off
You can't take the hate
We can't bring up love when
You caught me out today
All the time we spend so fruitless
And the loneliness kills and spills
I feel like I'm drowning
But I'm washing my hair
Such a conversation killer
But I'm glad that you're there
I tried to look inside
But change brings on change
I wish my words had been more brave
But change brings on change
How much longer can we spend the days
I feel awkward and don't fit into your life
Only a few more hearts to break
Only the pressure and the wait
As it slowly digs into our hands
When it's not planned
Just wish the walls would give way
Only a few more hearts to break
Only the pressure and the wait
As it slowly digs into our hands
When it's not planned
Just wish the walls would give way
When you've seen the light
You know what's right
And what's wrong for you
So don't count the days
These are the desperate times
You could hear a pin drop
Down to my knees I fell
Gorgeous to the very core
All these good intentions
Left to fend for themselves
Down to my knees I fell
Gorgeous to the very core
Blackens in the shade
So you wish on crooked stars
And who you wrap around your heart
Might just go off course for a while
But I won't go far...
And as I lick my wounds
And cower in the gloom
And when you find me there you'll search no more
I would give it all I would sacrifice
Look at me way up high
I must be a sight lovely to see
Nothing will stop me now
Look how far I've risen
High over the moon higher I fly
Heading far out of sight
Second star to the right
Follow all the arrows
I'm about to disappear
I built my house from barley rice
Green pepper walls and water ice
And everything emptying into white.
With everything emptying into white.
A sad blue eyed drummer rehearses outside
A black spider dancing on top of his eye
Red legged chicken stands ready to strike
And everything emptying into white.
I built my house from barley rice
Green pepper walls and water ice...
Someday you'll come back to me.
But spring seems like eternity.
In your kiss it wasn't goodbye.
You were still the reason why.
My heart still surrenders like the sun to the moon.
Were the last words you said to me.
My hands still reach out for you.
There is nothing I can do.
I can barely get through the day
Ever since you went away.
My heart still surrenders like the sun to the moon.
Were your last words you said
Heaven help us cross this endless sea
With starlight above to guide you to me.
They're calling our names forever more.
My heart still surrenders like the sun to the moon.
Who knows when we shall meet again
Keeps flowing like a river
Who knows when we shall meet again
Till it's gone forever
Who knows where we shall meet again
Till it's gone forever
When troubles come and my heart burdened be
Until you come and sit awhile with me.
You raise me up to more than I can be.
You raise me up to more than I can be.
All of the women I knew were my friends
I didn't know I was on the way down
I had a billion or two in the bank
You gave me all that a woman could give
All of the women I knew were my friends
You get your kicks out of watching me cry
Why do you laugh when there are tears in my eyes
My skies are not so sunny
Why don't you make up your mind
Let me put my arms around you
Make rainbows all around you
But I don't know if you are mine
We could be happy till the very day I die
Why do you laugh when there are tears in my eyes
My skies are not so sunny
Why don't you make up your mind
Let me put my arms around you
Make rainbows all around you
But I don't know if you are mine
My skies are not so sunny
Why don't you make up your mind
Let me put my arms around you
Make rainbows all around you
But I don't know if you are mine
But I don't know if you are mine
Ooh. love was true yesterday
I saw you standing there
You gave me cause to stare
You could be mine if you tried
All that you do is tell me lies
You think that love's a game
But I don't feel the same
I should have known that I'll get the pain
I saw you standing there
You gave me cause to stare
Am I gonna have you for me
One little light I saw before
Give me a chance . Make up your mind
Give me romance . Tell me you're mine
Am gonna have you for me
Without you darling I just can't sleep
I'm only happy when we're together
I guess it's time that I told you so
I'll always want to hold you
I wish that you were mine to be forever and ever
Without you darling I just can't sleep
I'm only happy when we're together
I guess it's time that I told you so
I'll always want to hold you
I'd like to be the one to see your loving mind at the start
I'd like to know how far you'd go to use those lips of wine
You practice to deceive
I've got no room to breathe
You practice to deceive
I've got no room to breathe
Too many boys on your mind
I don't know what I'm doing
Ever since I looked at you.
Ever since I saw you in the moonlight
Straighten up the mess in my mind about this place
I can't contain myself anymore
Can't you see it's written all over my face
Why don't you get on your feet
It's about time you got to think
What ever happened to peace
The world and it's corruption and moral decay
Why you're so clean through and through you won't shake hands
You're so blown up with anger about the world
You write the songs about
Yet you don't even know your neighbors name
Now you want to go the the moon and live there
When you know it'll only end up the same
You strive to get ahead
But you leave each other dead
Wine and women and song will only make me sad.
Cars and buses and trams make a lot of noise.
All my women have gone out with other boys.
Wine and women and song will only make me sad.
And don't believe the jealous lies they told to you
Now don't you know I love you more than I can say
And it would mean my life if you should run away
You just won't listen to my pleas
Some may find peace of mind loving a girl like you
You hurt me and you fool around.
You don't even give me a chance.
Well it's over and I'm telling you
It's the end of our romance.
Some may find peace of mind loving a girl like you
You hurt me and you fool around.
You don't even give me a chance.
Well it's over and I'm telling you
It's the end of our romance.
Some may find peace of mind loving a girl like you
Take hold of that star I give to you
And tell me that you love me
Take hold of that star and put it in your locket
And tell me that you love me
I'd give you the moon or the sun
Take hold of that star and put it in your locket
And tell me that you love me
I'd give you the moon or the sun
Or the starlights with a love so true.
Take hold of that star and put it in your locket
And tell me that you love me
Come on and give to me what I have missed
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so
I'm gonna get you or else there will be a big row
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so
Come on and show to me what I have missed
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so
Well I'm telling you now
I'm so weary from holding this load
And the wind will take me hold before the cold
Each flower I have seen
And the wind will take me home where I can dream
I must be on my way for my home is anywhere
As the wind gently blows in my hair
As the wind gently blows in my hair
Is it you my love that I can see
You are my love so baby I'm all right
So what will I do when baby you are gone
How many times must I tell you I love
Tell you I love you times before
Don't believe that I'm worth all your kisses
How many birds will I see high and flying
How many birds will it take till I get you
My love for you will be stronger then truer
I'll look at you and there's no doubt
How many birds will I see high and flying
How many birds will it take till I get you
I only do the best I can
It's just a price that you must pay
So I go from town to town
They all say that I'm a clown
They play high and I play
They play high and I play
So I go from town to town
They all say that I'm a clown
They play high and I play down
They play high and I play
So I go from town to town
They all say that I'm a clown
They play high and I play down
See the cracks upon the wall
We do not know the meaning of it all
Ain't no fire to warm my feet
Ain't got a nickel for a bit to ear
Ain't no mirror to comb my face
Just keep on going from place to place
Ain't got no lights above my head
Don't even bother to leave my bed
But then again you may not take me back
Oh just to put my hat back on your rack
Guess I don't know why I bother with myself
You will find a part of me in someone else
I never argued with the fact that she is mine
I only hurt her and kissed her three times out of nine
You have the edge to talk to men and make them feel at home
You spent that every lasting cent on someone that's not your own
Bear with me there's bound to be a chance
To heal the wound and start back our romance
I gained a heart and part of it is yours
Oh just to see my love walk through these doors
You don't care if rain falls in my room
You won't be there if trouble fills my spoon
I'm just a clown that plays around with misery in my way
People in their pride believe it's easier for them to leave
Lasting love is such a funny thing
When you're in love you're on the wings
When you're high and mighty you'll remember how I loved you
In the night is such a lonely time
I dream of you and that's a sign
It means that I am still a fool
And I am still so much in love with you
And where are the friends
The girl that I loved
She likes to wander and that's why I'm under
The spell of her jingle jangle
We used to cry on each others shoulder
She used to wander and that's why I'm under
The spell of her jingle jangle
It would take a lot to ease my pain from all these chains
I get so angry I could cry
Why do you leave me feeling bad they way I do
Night is day and day is night
Need you girl you re not in sight
Now as my heart lies in pieces of eight
You were a part of my love but too late
This I think that you should know
I'd like to stay but I know you won't play
My daddy put me on his knee and showed me the way to go
I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man
If you got what it takes my boy
You can always choose
Work it out before it's too late my boy
Make sure you never lose
I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man
I remember all the words you were softly saying
I'll be waiting for now and forever
For you to come to me.
I'll be waiting for now and forever
For you to come to me.
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again.
People won't believe me but there's truth in what I say.
Many hearts were broken and a lot of tears were shed.
The sky was black and the battlefield was red.
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again.
There's grapeshot all around us and the field is black with lead.
You better start running boy before you lose your head.
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again.
I fixed my bayonet to my gun and really mowed them down.
The three kisses of love.
Tell me that you really care.
I run your fingers through my hair.
The three kisses of love.
Tell me that you really care.
I run your fingers through my hair.
And to this day when tales are told of pioneers a thousand fold
And to this day when tales are told of pioneers a thousand fold
If this was my love I didn't want to share.
Every day I have to cry.
But if you do it's gonna hurt somebody.
Every day I have to cry.
Every time it's gonna hurt somebody.
I'm going to take you out tonight
I'm going to take you out tonight
I'm going to take you out tonight
Sweeter still when we're alone
Greener still when she's with me
The stars that night shine big and bright for me
She's true to me the way that she will always be
Sweeter still when we're alone
The stars that night shine big and bright for me
She's true to me the way that she will always be
Sweeter still when we're alone
There are times that I should go away
To think of you and I
In the night time when I lie awake
And think of you in my heart
Oh wouldn't you believe me if I told you
When I think of things that ought to be
And I feel your hand in mine
Oh wouldn't you believe if I told you
When I think of things that ought to be
And I feel your hand in mine
I'm the kind of man you can't explain
True love is one thing I've been dreaming of
I give my love to you. And when I do
I'm anything that you want me to be
The shadows in my eyes don't make it good for
Me to see the way I should
I'm anything that you want me to be
I'm the kind of man that you can't explain
All of the women I knew were my friends
I didn't know I was on the way down
I had a billion or two in the bank
You gave me all that a woman could give
All of the women I knew were my friends
Wine and women and song will only make me sad.
Cars and buses and trams make a lot of noise.
All my women have gone out with other boys.
Wine and women and song will only make me sad.

I'm gonna buy myself a time machine
And all those people passing by
And the town crier makes his cry
Big wide hats and men is spats
With those horseless carriages
And there are lots of things to do
On a bicycle built for two
I'm gonna buy myself a time machine
And all those people passing by
And the town crier makes his cry
It's something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Ooh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
Can't think what I've just said
Put the soft pillow on my head
Millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
Yet millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
It's something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Think of something nice
I can feel the speaking sky
It's filling up the air
Grandpa's fairy tales
Red chair round the fire
Rainbows all the time
We're all going higher
I can feel the speaking sky
It's filling up the air
Think of something nice
I can feel the speaking sky
It's filling up the air
Red chair fade away...
One minute woman please
I go down on my knees
To say it to you with a word so true
Why you don't want my hand
I try to find what's on your mind
Why don't you stop and see
Would it hurt to say hello
One minute woman please
I go down on my knees
To say it to you with a word so true
Why don't you stop and see
Would it hurt to say hello
One minute woman please
I go down on my knees
To say it to you with a word so true
That was when I was somebody.
Even when the lights go out.
Still got things to think about.
Memories I can't call mine.
Is thinking of something wild
He smiled and rubbed the stubble on his chin
He sure shall find the weariness and dreariness of life that's growing thin
Yet he didn't have so very far to go
With a pencil in his hand he will travel on as planned
With a mere step in the mountain to a light
Oh they don't know where he is
Even in the morning when he slept
Something odd is missing
There's nothing very much to talk about
And nothing very much to see
Oh they don't know where he is
Talks about the place he'd like to go
And you never see the worrying and hurrying and that makes a person slow
Yet you wouldn't think he'd be so hard to find
Yet he looks so very busy but there's nothing on his mind
And his wavy hair continues not to grow
Oh they don't know where he is
Oh they don't know where he is
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home.
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home.
Yet early that morning was he to receive a surprise.
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home.
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home.
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home.
That never shone on me
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
In my brain I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
Look at me I'm riding high
Don't know what's wrong with me.
Can't you see I'm not the guy
That I pretend to be.
Though I know I will be lonely
But our love will never die
I'd like to run away.
I know that I can't stay.
Though I know I will be lonely
But our love will never die
Though I know I will be lonely
But our love will never die
I used to smile and say hello. Guess I was just a happy guy.
I just can't move myself. I guess it all just had to be.
Mine eyes can only look at you... you.
I watched the falling rain and listened to the sweet birds sing.
Mine eyes can only look at you... you.
Every single word you hear... is coming from this heart of mine.
I never felt like this before... a love like yours so young and fine.
And now as I try to forget you... it doesn't work out any way.
I loved you such a long time ago... but in my eyes you'll always be.
I loved you such a long time ago... don't know why...
And I don't know why... baby...
Mine eyes can only look at you... you.
Many years ago I was a simple man
Maybe I've been lying on your couch too long
I'll stay if you can see me through
And now I'm all alone.
I've sent the children far away
To some obscure unknown.
That age won't bother me.
It all went out to sea
The rain is in my hair.
My home is in my chair.
I'm gonna buy myself a time machine
And all those people passing by
And the town crier makes his cry
Big wide hats and men is spats
With those horseless carriages
And there are lots of things to do
On a bicycle built for two
I'm gonna buy myself a time machine
And all those people passing by
And the town crier makes his cry
One minute woman please
I go down on my knees
To say it to you with a word so true
Why you don't want my hand

One minute woman please
I go down on my knees
To say it to you with a word so true
Stands a man who's feeling very tired
Looking at a song he wrote some time ago
Every day I go away and find ideas
Couldn't I write a song about a man who's dead
Didn't really know if he was off his head
Too bad for gilbert green
We can tell the world that he was right
Sitting in his attic on a sunny day
Mending 50 goblets that are worn
Humming to himself a song of yesteryear
His hearing wasn't good but his eyes were clear
Too bad for gilbert green
We can tell the world that he was right
Now the house is burnt along with gilbert green
Sad to see his sisters stand and cry
And in the basement lies a song that wasn't seen
Tells the tale of laughing men and yellow beans
Too bad for gilbert green
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
I keep straining my ears to hear a sound

The butler henry baker extinguishes the fires
All must be up early to have the morning meal
The maid comes with decanter and to the butler there
It must be good to live in the house of lords
It must be good to live in the house of lords
The house is now in darkness before the coming day
The housemaid drew the curtains and the doctors watched the dawn
It must be sad to live in the house of lords
It must be sad to live in the house of lords
The hall is now in sadness and everybody cried
It must be sad to live in the house of lords
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home.

Mine eyes can only look at you... you.
Watching all the hours
Counting all the flowers that I grow
Sitting on the inside
Watching all the outside people go
Dreaming all around my clock
Dreaming all around my clock... in the night time
Mr. Weeping Willow lazing on my pillow knows my mind deep inside
Tells me all the stories listens to the worries that I tried to keep inside
Dreaming all around my clock
Dreaming all around my clock... in the night time
Dreaming all around my clock
Dreaming all around my clock... in the night time
Think about the sunshine
Thinking of the night I'm on my own
Trying not to harden things that grow
Dreaming all around my clock
Dreaming all around my clock... in the night time
Dreaming all around my clock

And of course it rains everyday.
And of course it rains everyday.
I'd remember all of the times I've gone wrong.
And of course it rains everyday.
You should be here standing so near to me.
But give me time alone to get it out of my mind.
Though say I know it's only the weather.
And the sun will shine if just for you.
Trains walk by and the birds disappear.
But why am I still here without you by my side.
And the rain will fall.
And the clouds will break
And the sun will shine
Incidentally there should be some changes made.
You've got to work if you should have to save.
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget.
You've got to play it cool before they come and throw the net.
Wait a while and straighten out the tie you wear.
You've got to take it easy if you dare.
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget.
You've got to play it cool before they come and throw the net.
Stop the bells that ring so loud.
Just think of everything you've worked so hard to bring.
The lemon sings my song. He's known it all along.

Turn me down. Turn me down
Really and sincerely I've tried.
But I don't hear a sound.
Turn me down. Turn me down.
Really and sincerely.
Birdie told me I must get over you somehow.
And she told me never to think of you right now.
But it's hopeless to say how can I forget the way she used to love me.
Funny faces loving the traces memory.
But it's hopeless to say how can I forget the way she used to love me.

But it's hopeless to say how can I forget the way she used to love me.
I think about her in my time know in my mind it's over.
Nor do I listen to the words you say.
But every promise seems to fade away.
There is no reasoning or asking why.
I love you deeply with the sun in my eyes.
There is no reasoning or asking why.
I love you deeply with the sun in my eyes.

And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own.
Gotta do the things I wanna do.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
They brought me back to see my way with you.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen.
There she goes my daytime girl.
Spreading her wings like a high flying eagle.
All the people will stare as she falls to the ground.
Heaven knows my daytime girl.
Never been kissed she don't know what she's missing.
All the kisses there are to be found.
All the wisdom of people she used.
She took advantage of this.
Taking time to remember the past.
Remembering all she has missed.
What a dream this place has been.
All the wisdom of people she used.
She took advantage of this.
Taking time to remember the past.
Remembering all she has missed.
There she goes my daytime girl.
Spreading her wings like a high flying eagle.
I've got no reason to try.
You did it to me and I'm taking a stand.
You've got a reason to cry.
Fairy stories in the penny arcade.
You bought my love and I paid.
I'm not trying to make history.
You could have been good to me.
Fairy stories in the penny arcade.
I'm not trying to make history.
You could have been good to me.
Spent my life making my love to you.
I've got no reason to try.
Got no reason left for making you blue.
You've got a reason to cry.
Fairy stories in the penny arcade.
You bought my love and I paid.
I'm not trying to make history.
You could have been good to me.
You better run just as fast as you can.
Look out my window. I can see tomorrow.
Just a whole way of sorrow when the change is made.
But I got to go on living after the change is made.
I have been lying under a pillow of dreams
And feeling moments of swimming in cream
You are a good friend
Your father wants you to live on his knee
I have been lying under a pillow of dreams
And feeling moments of swimming in cream
Barker sing me a song
There must be something there
There must be something there
Barker sing me a song
Never before have I seen the like
Barker sing me a song
Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
Cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory
Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
To take your heart away
Laughing at people with stars in their eyes
Talking with the lambs who came out of the sky
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
Laughing at people with stars in their eyes
Talking with the lambs who came out of the sky
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
Watching them sail and the sun as sinks in the sea.
Only the eyes of the doomed with a smile on their face.
Take a look inside myself.
Windows that slide up and down with a squeak in the sound.
Though you remember my name.
And if you go away I'll get it off somehow.
Turn me down. Turn me down
Really and sincerely I've tried.
But I don't hear a sound.
Turn me down. Turn me down.
Really and sincerely.
This is my swan song.
This is my swan song.
I fell in love with you I love you well.
My love will build a castle in the air.
A chance to show the world that I am strong.
This is my last dance.
I'm walking off the floor where I belong.
My love will build a castle in the air.
My love will build a castle in the air.
This is my swan song.
Deeply deeply deeply me
Deeply deeply deeply me
Gave my love a diamond ring
Platinum engagement thing
She told me our love can be
Deeply deeply deeply me
Taking thousand footstep drops
I can't live without her now
Ending life I think somehow
Deeply deeply deeply me
Let it happen to me and you
I've got to give you my life
I'm tired of living without your giving
I've got to get you for my wife
Can't hold on much longer
The feeling's getting stronger
And let it be both of us
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can
I see a thousand golden daffodils
I see a million tears in Kitty's eyes
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can
Now Eve is bad and treats me cruel
She loves to see me looking like a fool
I find a way with words I say
To be in love in such a lonely way
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can
Now they are two and I am one
I cannot fall in love with everyone
So I must choose between the two
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can
For the summer of his years.
He would always hear when there was no one near
For the Summer of his years.
Fine Indian Gin and whiskey dry.
All ten lawmen lining up for their handy brandy.
But I've tried and I'm tied to Indian Gin and whiskey dry.
To Indian Gin and whiskey dry
To Indian Gin and whiskey dry
To Indian Gin and whiskey dry
Can you believe that what you see could never ever be so real somehow.
There's some help needed here and you're there.
You can see if you stand on your chair.
That there's millions and millions and
Millions and millions of people like
Could you believe that what you read
One thousand pages couldn't tell you why.
There's some help needed here and you're there.
You can see if you stand on your chair.
That there's millions and millions and
Millions and millions of people like you.
That there's millions and millions and
All that I hear doesn't feel right.
Don't call me till you're all right.
Once in a while he says good night.
I just sat and then I cried.
Have so much fun in my leisure.
The preacher talked to me and he smiled
Now for once in your life you're alone
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I told him I'm in no hurry
And for once in my life I'm alone
And I've got to let her know just in time before I go
I've just go to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I've just got to get a message to her
One more hour and my life will be through
I been thinking sitting on a pole.
I'm getting sick of doing what I'm told.
Just me and the mirror and my brain.
But that was when I got an idea.
Came like a gun and shot in my ear.
Fifteen years I lay down on the ground.
I couldn't feel any noise or hear any sound.
Fifteen million years I spent down the line.
But that was when I got an idea.
Came like a gun and shot in my ear.
Get up and stand alone
That was when I got an idea.
Came like a gun and shot in my ear.
Get up and stand alone.
That's when I got an idea
I wander lonely as a cloud
I keep my head above the crowd
Ain't nobody else as big as me
But I must remember friends
What has to start just has to end
Everybody's got a destiny
And I know when the swallows flies
Then I'll be told what I am
I'll look after number one
I'll forget the beggar's son
Everybody's got to stay alive
I'll keep my head above the crowd
And I know when the swallows flies
Then I'll be told what I am
And I know when the swallows flies
Yes I know when the swallow flies
But I'm going to join the air force today.
Perhaps it's going to drive him to drink.
But I don't care what my father might think.
Alone on the ground. now I find
I've seen my friends and they all agree
That's it's better than joining the army or going to sea
I've seen my friends and they all agree.
That's it's better then joining the army or going to sea.
Which started the whole world crying
That the joke was on me
Which started the whole world laughing
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Which started the whole world living
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Which started the whole world living
That the joke was on me
With my feathers of power I laugh as the hours go slowly by.
I am a street watching the people walk.
As I listen their conversations glisten as they start to talk.
As we sit on the hill and we drink and we swill
As we sit on the hill and we drink and we swill
This is my swan song.
This is my swan song.
I fell in love with you I love you well.
My love will build a castle in the air.
A chance to show the world that I am strong.
This is my last dance.
I'm walking off the floor where I belong.
My love will build a castle in the air.

Tomorrow you can climb a mountain
Sail a sailboat through a fountain
Play no games he'd say to me when the light is gone
So please don't make no hesitation
There will be no recreation
And it's shattering to hear you mustn't listen with your ear
He'd sing his song most every night
Wishing she was there behind the light
The people danced and sang along
On the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong
And the piper played the tune
And the drummer wore his spurs
But the song that the singer sang was for her
Now the singer's song is never heard
And the visions he once saw are disappeared
Now they never dance or sing along
But on the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong
And the piper played the tune
And the drummer wore his spurs
But the song that the singer sang was for her

I've got to give you my life
I'm tired of living without your giving
I've got to get you for my wife
Can't hold on much longer
The feeling's getting stronger
And let it be both of us
Another cold and windy day
And as I feel my mind is turning
And think of times when I were glad
I open up some Coke and smile
And then my minds free for a while
Things go better with Coke
The British ship Veronica was lost without a sign.
Captain Richardson left himself a lonely wife in Hull.
I'm on an iceberg running free
Sailing my way back to your lips
One passing ship gave word that
You have moved out of your old flat
You love the Vicar more then words can say
Tell him to pray that I won't melt away
And I'll see your face again
They haven't got their dog anymore
Can't seem to leave the sea anymore
I just can't understand why you just moved to Finland
You love that Vicar more then words can say
Ask him to pray that I won't melt away
And I'll see your face again
It's much to late to change your ways.
Far too many vows have been broken.
You can't expect a soul to stay.
You think that you can stand and lie.
It makes me laugh . You got no friends.
It took a thousand years to find out why.
You'll never see my face again.
You know that you've been left before this night.
It's come my turn to make it over.
I wish that I could be a rover.
You think that you can stand and lie.

I had a dream of a place far away.
I followed a river where the dead man would play.
And I'm leaving in the morning.
And I'm leaving in the morning.
Those big black diamonds that lie there for me.
By the tall white mountains which lie by the sea.
And you a man who's as tall as the sky
Followed a river where thousands have died.
He was leaving in the morning.
He was leaving in the morning.
If I come home and my women has flown.
Those big black diamonds that lie there for me
By the tall white mountains which lie by the sea
Pulled down the head and looked in the glass just to see if I was in.
Went up the stairs and kissed my women to make her come alive.
I got to go for a Sunday drive.
I got to go for a Sunday drive.
Ten miles and three quarters more I wasn't feeling any more alive.

I sat alone with my thoughts and laughed.
Then saw your face in an old photograph.
Keep on burning while this heart of mine is yearning.
Keep on burning till this love of yours is mine
Come home again dear.
I have waited year after year under the lamp in our old avenue.
See the children play the ball. See them play along the hall.
It makes me cry to see them smile.
I see reflections in my eyes. And there's no one to share my life.
I need a life to go my way.
Just give me someone for my life.
I feel a clown. People try to play me down.
And there's one thing I never found.
See the old man walk the lane. See him walk along in pain.
It makes me cry to see them smile.
I see reflections in my eyes.
And there's no one to share my life.
Just give me someone for my life.

So I laugh in your face. Your only one race.
Yes I laugh in your face and I'm right.
You lie just like the rest. But there's nobody best.
So I laugh in your face and I'm right.
I'll pull out your plug so your small.
You'll slide down the drain.
On the steps of St. Peter's you all look the same.
So I laugh in your face. Your only one race.
Yes I laugh in your face and I'm right.
You lie just like the rest. But there's nobody best.

We used to love while others used to play
Some one else moved in from far away
And you don't ask the time of day
But guess we'll cry come first of May
The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine
And you don't ask the time of day
But guess we'll cry come first of May
Do do do do do do do do do...

Never say never say never again
You said goodbye I declared war on Spain.
Never say never say never again.
Never never never never
We used to love while others used to play
Some one else moved in from far away
And you don't ask the time of day
But guess we'll cry come first of May
The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine
And you don't ask the time of day
But guess we'll cry come first of May
Do do do do do do do do do...
We used to love while others used to play
Some one else moved in from far away
And you don't ask the time of day
But guess we'll cry come first of May
The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine
And you don't ask the time of day
But guess we'll cry come first of May
Do do do do do do do do do...
Cause nobody loves me
And each night I sleep
Your memory haunts me
The shadow is me... the shadow is me
I'm everyone's no one
Cause nobody likes me
That someone will reach me
The shadow is me... the shadow is me... the shadow is me
Cause nobody loves me
And each I sleep the pain is so deep
Your memory haunts me
It's something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Ooh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
Can't think what I've just said
Put the soft pillow on my head
Millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
Yet millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
It's something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
The preacher talked to me and he smiled
Now for once in your life you're alone
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I told him I'm in no hurry
And for once in my life I'm alone
And I've got to let her know just in time before I go
I've just go to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I've just got to get a message to her
One more hour and my life will be through
I used to smile and say hello. Guess I was just a happy guy.
I just can't move myself. I guess it all just had to be.
Mine eyes can only look at you... you.
I watched the falling rain and listened to the sweet birds sing.
Mine eyes can only look at you... you.
Every single word you hear... is coming from this heart of mine.
I never felt like this before... a love like yours so young and fine.
And now as I try to forget you... it doesn't work out any way.
I loved you such a long time ago... but in my eyes you'll always be.
I loved you such a long time ago... don't know why...
And I don't know why... baby...
Mine eyes can only look at you... you.
Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
Cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory
Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
To take your heart away
Which started the whole world crying
That the joke was on me
Which started the whole world laughing
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Which started the whole world living
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Which started the whole world living
That the joke was on me
And where are the friends
The girl that I loved
We used to love while others used to play
Some one else moved in from far away
And you don't ask the time of day
But guess we'll cry come first of May
The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine
And you don't ask the time of day
But guess we'll cry come first of May
Do do do do do do do do do...
And of course it rains everyday.
And of course it rains everyday.
I'd remember all of the times I've gone wrong.
And of course it rains everyday.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own.
Gotta do the things I wanna do.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
They brought me back to see my way with you.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen.
That never shone on me
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
In my brain I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
Is thinking of something wild
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
It's something I thinks worthwhile

I'd want I'd never need.
If I could get the nerve to plant the seed.
I see her face in myself.
If only had my mind on something else.
Captain of the submarine beneath the icebergs never seen.
I keep on pushing never stop.
If I could just forget her name.
I see her face in myself.
If only had my mind on something else.
You know I love getting up in the morning
When the sun first strikes the trees
All the morning birds that sing above
Still bring back memories
Of a girl who stood beside me
When the rights I did were wrong
But she went back down the river
Just when I thought I could be strong
She never told me why she left me
But the letter said goodbye
And my nights to reason why
Why a stranger comes to steal the love
Of a girl I had to hold
But she went back down the river
Just when I thought I could be strong
I never ask for any time from you baby.
I never ask for any lies.
You only hurt the one you love the most baby.
You only had to make me cry.
And I keep thinking of your love.
The things we dreamed about.
How much I love you baby.
We had the world and the stars above.
You left me to stand alone.
You left me to stand alone.
You can believe what you wanna but I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
You can believe what you wanna but I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
You think you live on laughter. But you don't know what's after.
Singing Hallelujah. I can know the Master.
You can believe what you wanna but I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
You can believe what you wanna but I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
When my life is over. Lie in fields of clover.
Waiting for my own girl. Living in a new world . Yeah...
You can believe what you wanna but I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
You can believe what you wanna but I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
You can believe what you wanna but I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
You can believe what you wanna but I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
When I was you we walked to school
But you grew up and said goodbye
I still remember the things that made me cry
For all too soon my story ends
I held your hand and I told you things
Then all too soon my story ends
Only last night when your arms held me tight
I was the one that gave you all the love when I thought
The whole world joins in
And everyone cries as teardrops begin
And when darkness falls
Can't seem right there at all
The whole world joins in
I lay down and die. the teardrops begin.
I lay down and die. and die. and die.
I lay down and die. the whole world joins in
I lay down and die and the teardrops begin
If your heart tells you so that you should leave me
You've forgotten all the words that you once said
Long as I've got you there beside me
Long as you're there to stand and guide me
The love we share no one can ever tear apart
Long as I've got this life I'm living
Long as it's you the love I'm with then
I'll keep on calling you sweetheart
If my love for you can't make you happy
Just open the door and you won't see my anymore
You've forgotten all the words that you once said
Long as I've got you there beside me
Long as you're there to stand and guide me
The love we share no one could ever tear apart
Long as I've got this life I'm living
Long as it's you the love I'm with then
I'll keep on calling you sweetheart
I must have been born in the night
I've done my load and I'll carry my load
And all I own is my life
And stand beneath the hanging tree
Bury me down by the river
Let all the towns people see
Just put me down and set me free
Just put me down and set me free
Bury me down by the river
I see my dog lying under the table
I see him licking my brother's girlfriend's hand
I can't understand those eyes that keep staring at me
I can't understand how you do what you do to me
I keep on looking for you everywhere
I can't get used to the feeling you're giving me
You and me we're both the same
In this life a lonely game
I used to be a happy man
And now I understand just what it's all about
I never had a doubt on the chance of love
As a boy I lived down here
I always saw you near
To be together was happiness
And I just can't forget the moment we first kissed
I'd like to try again on the chance of love
I'll do anything to get you by my side
On the sound of love I will love you girl
All the world would then be free
An apple falls from an apple tree
You and I will be together
And you will understand when I take your hand
What would I say if you should turn away from me
I do not know if there are words that I can see
I only know that I am reaching too high
And who are we to touch the wind
And say our ship is coming in
I don't know if love can last
When time is gone and we are on the roundabout
Would you still laugh and be a clown when love runs out
Or will you say that I am reaching too high
And who are we to touch the wind
And say our ship is coming in
And who are we to touch the the wind
And say our ship is coming in
Oh my heart won't believe that you have left me
I keep telling my self that it's true
I can get over anything you want my love
But I can't get myself over you
Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
Don't forget to remember me my love
On my wall lies a photograph of you girl
Though I try to forget you somehow
You're the mirror of my soul so take me out of my hole
Let me try to go on living right now
Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
People laugh and people cry.
I go to work. I close the gate.
If the clouds get together and talk about the weather
If it's rain they anticipate
Yes the storm will break but never me you see.
Two years on. Two years on.
But only you can see me.
For I am he with something more
It's you and I reality.
If the cloud get together and talk about the weather
If it's rain they anticipate
Yes the storm will break but never me you see
Two years on. Two years on.
But only you can see me
Two years on. Two years on.
Summers come and summers go
But I still need the rain
All your vines will overgrow
And winds will blow insane
And I won't make you cry
You can shelter in my home
And I won't ask you why
Friends will come and friends will go
But you stay on my train
All your wines will overflow
As winds will blow insane
And I won't make you cry
You can shelter in my home
And I won't ask you why
You can shelter in my home
Everybody wants to leave
I have all year to smile
What makes the world go round
My mind is lost and found
And would I pray what makes the world go round
I'm a man for all seasons
I'm a man for all seasons
I'm a man for all seasons
George was born somewhere inside London town
Working as he grew for that extra pound.
Respected by all he married and made a home.
To give his children more then he had known.
But then he died without an explanation.
Years before a fire sent him in the street.
It took him months of work to make ends meet.
But then he died without and explanation.
Took a plane to Cairo
Then a Cessna to Rome
I got hijacked to Tel Aviv
And it's the first time that I've flown
Took a train to Jordan
And to Texas and back
I met Lyndon B. Johnson and I felt his hand on my back
I ain't got no claim to nothing.
I don't mess with anyone.
I walk my way living in a masquerade.
And one day I looked behind me at all the things I've done.
That's the 1st mistake I ever made.
I was born to a lonely women in a town called Buffalo.
Never knew the man who never stayed.
That's the 1st mistake I ever made.
With a million hearts I've broken.
I never kept the score.
Memories of good love hate to stay.
But I still remember someone who loved me so much more.
That's the 1st mistake I ever made.
I know my story ended when I lost my only love.
That's the 1st mistake I ever made.
I was born to a lonely women in a town called Buffalo.
Never knew the man who never stayed.
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
I see you every morning
Outside the restaurants
The music plays so nonchalant
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
The wants you have me for have expired
In all I was a soul you were using
You can't believe the tears that I've shed
I'm on a bound down train
Don't desert me now or I am dead
There's no one there for you to confide in
It's instinct to always to have a shoulder to cry on
Someone there to share and to shine on
You can't believe the tears that I've shed
I'm on a bound down train
Don't desert me now or I am dead
You can't believe the tears that I've shed
I'm on a bound down train
Don't desert me down or I am dead
You can't believe the tears that I've shed
I'm on a bound down train
If you think that you can hurt me and make my cry
And if you think that you can hurt me with lies that cry
Now I've got my reasons for feeling this way
Day after day and as nights go by
All of the world is as lonely as me
Day after day and as nights go by
So if you think my heart is broken and I might die
And I'm proud of that fact as you can plainly see.
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.
I spend my life working up a sweat to be a bad boy.
Going from town to town. Now I tell you I've been around.
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.
Lay it on me ... yeah...
And I'm proud of that fact as you can plainly see.
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.
Send out your invitations
We'll meet you at the station
You know the race has just begun
If you don't know that I was born to hold you
We're gonna climb a mountain
No one is gonna stop me now
My love is like a fountain
I'll take your hand and show you how
If you don't think that I was born to hold you
Send our your invitation
We'll meet you at the station
You know the race has just begun
If you don't know that I was born to hold you
Our house was so cold
And I was still in school and learning
And then I never really got too far
The street where I lived is blown up and gone
And I've had a good day crying
I never really gave much more
You will see me at the time I love the best
In the daytime I will meet you as before.
Building castles in the shifting sands
In the morning of my life the
Minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day
To the top right hand corner of
The ceiling in my room
It is the morning of my life
It is the morning of my life
I love you like nobody else
I love you like nobody else
I love you like nobody else
Put yourself in my place
Take a look at my face
The world I say is you
I love you and nobody else
I love you and nobody else
I love you and nobody else
I love you like nobody else
I love you like nobody else
What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreaming boy
And now I'm lost in a daydream
And even if time ain't really on my side
I'm blowing the day to take a walk in the sun
And fall on my face on somebody's new mowed lawn
I've been having a sweet dream
Been dreaming since I woke up today
It's starring me and my sweet dream
And even if time is passing me by a lot
I couldn't care less about these blues you say I've got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping so low
And you can be sure that if you're feeling right
Tomorrow at breakfast you may perk up your ears
Or you may be daydreaming for a thousand years
What a day for a daydream
Custom made for a daydreaming boy
And now I'm lost in a daydream
It's gonna be a lonely winter.
And leave all the love we've known.
Autumn leaves will fall.
Wish winter would only call you back to me.
It's gonna be a lonely winter.
Till the winter's gone.
And the trees begin to bare.
But I know that you're not here.
You're the reason I don't sleep at night
You're the reason I don't sleep at night
Smoke cigarettes and drink coffee too
You're the reason I don't sleep at night
Come over and keep me company
Strum my guitar and sing out a tune
He's not such a very very old man
He's a soul man and he takes my hand
He makes a man feel good when he's down
Head is touching the ground
He's going to help you if he can
He's a whole man and he treats me nice
He makes a man feel good when he's down
Head is touching the ground
He's going to help you if he can
I need her loving so much the feeling is too much to bear
He's not such a very very old man
He's a soul man and he takes my hand
He makes a man feel good when he's down
Head is touching the ground
He's going to help you if he can
I need her loving so much the feeling is too much to bear
You've got to have somebody when she's not there
He's not such a very very old man
He's a soul man and he takes my hand
He's gonna help you when he's down
When your head is touching the ground
And he'll help you if he can
Green fields where we used to wander
And you left me here to cry
Green fields where we used to wander
We would play there beneath the sky
Is it raining in the sunshine
And the wind blows in my eyes
Lying face down to the hard ground
I can face the cloudy skies
And although I maybe dying I will bide my love
You were my girl in the springtime
With the sunshine in my day
And you touch me but you won't stay
Is it raining in the sunshine
And the wind blows in my eyes
Lying face down to the hard ground
I can face the cloudy skies
And although I may be dying I will bide my love
I been the mayor in this old town
What they really don't know is
I'll be the biggest thing that's happened here
And that's the way it's gonna stay
I'm marrying her today
I'll be the biggest thing that's happened here
And that's the way it's gonna stay
You're nobody till somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares
The world still is the same
You'll never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody till somebody loves you
We have lost the time
That was so hard to find
And I will lost my mind
You should want to hide
But I can't get through
I don't gave much to say
But I can't turn away
You refuse to even listen
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And I just can't go on
You refuse to even listen
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And I just can't go on
You'll find a pot of gold
You'll find it's all been told
But our love has a treasure our hearts always spend
And it has a story without any end
The water stops its flow
But just tell me you love and you are only mine
And our love will go on till the end of time
But just tell me you love and you are only mine
And our love will go on till the end of time
But if you fail . to keep it a tie
And I'll know what to do
You've got to wear that thing indefinitely
And I'll know what to do
Oh I'll know what to do
They always leave me on the shelf
I live my life all by myself
I live my life all by myself
I'm a man who stands alone
So take your hand down off my chair
I live my live all by myself
I live my life all by myself
I'm a man who stands alone
So take your hand down off my chair
And I ain't never seen no wealth
I live my live all by myself
The girl that's driving me mad
She said that living with me
Is bringing her down yeah.
For she would never be free
She ought to do right by me.
She ought to do right by me.
I think it's today yeah.
The girl that's driving me mad
She ought to do right by me.
She ought to do right by me
For she would never be free
Every single thing I try to do
I love you most of all because you're you
No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me
No matter what may be the style or season
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
Based on a novel by a man named Lear
It's the dirty story of a dirty man
And his clinging wife doesn't understand.
I'll be writing more in a week or two.
It could make a million for you overnight.
Somewhere a place for us.
Peace and quiet and open air
There's a time for us.
We'll find a way of forgiving
A time and place for us.
Hold my hand and we're half way there.
Hold my hand and I'll take you there.
You ask how much I need you
I need you oh my darling
You ask how long I'll love you
Until the twelfth of never I'll still be loving you
Melt my heart like April snow
I'll love you till the blue bells forget to bloom
I'll love you till the clover has lost its perfume
I'll love you till the poets run out of rhyme
And that's a long long time
Until the twelfth of never
There'll be rain till we run for cover
Lost in love in a world of strangers
Something only the Lord arranges
Want to live all my life around you
You're my light in a world of sorrow
Scared of losing this dream tomorrow
Loving one another that's how it should be
Try to rediscover no other but me
I lose the love that has always freed me
Never hearing you're golden laughter
Can't escape from the spell I'm under
I surrender to all your treasure
Endless nights of pain and pleasure
Try to rediscover no other but me
It's a drag to leave my door
Guess I'll have to say
I just cry my life away
I'll buy a top hat to brighten up my lonely life
And they can see that I've got the money for the things money brings
Put it on my head and each time I head to bed
Put it in a box near my dirty shoes an socks
I'll but a top hat to brighten up my lonely life
And they can see that I've got the money for the things money brings
3 pound 6 then please sir.
I'll but a top hat to brighten up my lonely life
And they can see that I've got the money for the things money brings
And until she comes and she brings me happiness
She's my baby and she lives next door.
She brings my coffee in my favorite cup.
I know she'll go with me down to the end.
I smile a damn and say she told me so.
I hear her on my door.
I know that she loves you now
But your heart doesn't keep any vows
And that's a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way to hurt that girl
It's a terrible way you treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world
Her heart isn't for a game
For that's a terrible way to treat your baby
It's a terrible way you treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world
And if you give me the chance to take her hand
And try to change her mind
For it's a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way you hurt that girl
It's a terrible way to treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world
For it's a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way you hurt that girl
It's a terrible way to treat your baby
When you know that I love her
And my baby runs this show and she's got a big share.
Sold my car and I got no transport in this town.
I can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrow
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
You've had your troubles Israel
But you put the writing on the wall
You know I've seen you fall so many times
I've cried for you and that's a crime
Where there's beautiful sand yeah
You know you got a kind of feeling
Take me into your arms
I like the smiles up on your people's faces
They make you feel warm embraces
And I want that kind of smile
Israel you make the whole world think about you
And if they don't they'll find a reason
To shout about Israel Israel
You're the only one Israel Israel
Oh take me into your arms
And make me feel your goodness
Take me into your arms
Let me hold hold you to myself
Israel Oh take me back into into your arms
Israel Israel Israel Israel
Before I heard your voice I never heard a sound like that before
I wanna hear it more and more
My love is stronger than the wall
I'll climb it till I fell so I can hear you call your love
I'd be the greatest man in the world
I'd be the greatest man in the world
Before I saw your face I never say a dream like that before
I wanna see it more and more
My love is stronger than the wall
I'll climb it till I fall so I can hear you call your love
Be the greatest man in the world
Be the greatest man in the world
Be the greatest man in the world
It's just the way that I feel about tomorrow.
I'll be sad and alone all the time.
I can't believe what you're saying.
Just the way that I feel about tomorrow.
Knowing you won't be there by my side.
I never really want to be alone.
I had a woman once in my life and but now she's flown.
I never really broke her heart. She was a part of me.
When you left I fell to pieces.
But now I feel as good as if I were dead.
I'll keep remembering all my life.
Remembering when you were my wife.
Remembering all my life.
And I'm facing a life that I must go through remembering.
I first set my eyes on you one cold February.
You made me go out of my way to make me feel fine.
When you left I fell to pieces.
Now I feel as good as good as if I were dead.
I'll keep remembering all my life.
Remembering when you were my wife.
Remembering all my life.
And on the balcony I knew inside of me it will be done.
Somebody stop the music. Somebody stop the tune.
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon.
Somebody stop the music. Somebody stop the tune.
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon.
Somebody stop the music. Somebody stop the tune.
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon.
Somebody stop the music. Somebody stop the tune.
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon.
I rolled into the smoke and there I lost my hope
I need someone to know me and to show me
The square peg fits the hole
I need someone to know me and to show me
Ten hundred people roam through the place I call me home
I need someone to know me and to show me
Don't need no one to show me
I am the searcher of my fortunes
I've got my right hand on the wheel
We've got to dig for buried treasures
I know exactly how I feel
Don't wanna live inside myself
I'm much better off alone
Don't wanna live inside myself
Where the darkness is my friend
I heard all about the beginning
I wanna see just where it ends
Don't wanna live inside myself
I'm much better off alone
Don't wanna live inside myself
I have fed the jaded tiger
And every tiger knows my name
I can tell myself my name
Don't wanna live inside myself
I'm much better off alone
Tell me if dreams do come true.
If so then I know that I'm losing you.
And you know the address where we live.
But I swear there'll be no turning back to you
When do I and when do I know if there's an answer why.
I wonder if I know where I fit in.
How do I and how do I stop myself from gonna cry.
I wonder if I know where I fit in
Tell me if dreams do come true.
If so then I know that I'm losing you.
And you know the address where we live.
But I swear there'll be no turning back to you
When do I and when do I know if there's an answer why.
I wonder if I know where I fit in.
And how do I and how do I stop myself from gonna cry
I wonder if I know where I fit in.
Wishing this picture was reality.
Here in my heart you're my dearest too.
I'm a lion with no crown.
Some kind of James Brown or something in between.
But when I ask for money you smother me in charms.
And man I had friends for miles around.
I was a lion in my winter.
And man I had friends for miles around.
I was a lion in my winter.
And man I had friends for miles around.
I was a lion in my winter.
I wish there was another year another time.
When people sang and poems rhymed.
My name could be Napoleon.
It's beautiful but hard to find.
But I just wasn't born in time.
Walking back to Waterloo again.
I can dream of growing trees and things that live and grass that's green
In meadows that have never been.
But I still place my trust in the Queen.
What is life when a man is pressured based on wrong or right.
And I don't know what it means.
There must be more we haven't seen.
Walking back to Waterloo again.
Walking back to Waterloo again.
Walking back to Waterloo again.
If ever you've got rain in your heart
Someone has hurt you and torn you apart
To open up your eyes to love me
And let it be like they said it would be
To open up your eyes to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder
And when you're out in the cold
No one beside you and no one to hold
To open up your eyes to love me
And when you've got nothing to lose
Nothing to pay for and nothing to choose
To open up your eyes to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Run to me whenever you're lonely
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Run to me whenever you're lonely
Run to me if you need a shoulder
We must have lost the road
Don't you think it's getting late
Maybe if it's colder we can stop and wait
We must have lost the words
All the little things we said
And now the world is frozen only you in my mind
We must have lost the tune
Where did I step out of line
I'll search for the melody that calls you mine
I've never been alone and I've only seen the sky
Still I know the reason why
I've been thinking it over
I've never climbed a tree but that's natural for me
And you don't know my name so I'm thinking it over
And if you were beside me you'd know what's inside me so tell me why
Give me inspiration to clear the situation we've known too long
And if we end up crying then one of us is lying so tell me
Never rode a plane and I never will again
And if you were beside me you'd know what's inside me so tell me why
Give me inspiration to clear the situation we've known too long
And if we end up crying then one of us is lying so tell me
Never rode a plane and I never will again
Things go dead in the night
Make enough noise to make enough noise
To make you want to jump with fright
You're better off then nothing
You're answering to no one
Thing go dead in the night
Make enough noise to make enough noise
To make you want to jump with fright
You're better off then nothing
You're answering to no one
All of a sudden it happened
When you did what you said you'd do
And you broke my heart in two
You came into my life
Things go dead in the night
Make enough noise to make enough noise
To make you wanna jump with fright
Elephant's tusks and autograph books
People you don't meet
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Jimmy had a bomb and the bomb went bang
Jimmy had a bomb and the bomb went bang
Jimmy had a bomb and the bomb went bang
I can make the sun shine out of the heavens
Just wait until the sun's on your pillow
I can change the whole world if you are near me
No tears if you can hear me
Just wait until the sun's on your pillow
Just wait until the sun's on your pillow
I held a party and nobody came
Strangely I was upset
Made up my bed and decided to sleep
Maybe I drank an excess of my drink
I never knew him so well
Yesterday was history who knows what there is gonna be when we meet again
Will you smile and tell the world about me
Can there be no doubt about me I was your friend
As I gaze upon a sea of smiling faces
Walk amongst the glow of moonlit places
Won't bring you back to me
I remember things we planned
The world would never understand but we found a way
And the world of love you gave to me
As I gaze upon a sea of smiling faces
Walk amongst the glow of moonlit places
Won't bring you back to me
Won't bring you back to me
Yesterday was history who knows what there is gonna be when me meet again
Will you smile and tell the world about me
Can there be no doubt about me I was your friend
As I gaze upon a sea of smiling faces
Walk amongst the glow of moonlit places
Won't bring you back to me
Won't bring you back to me
I've got a notion to live in an ocean of bad bad dreams
No consolation to mixed conversation in bad bad dreams
You know we're all alike
We can shout and scream and yell all night
It's just a bad bad dream
You know you're far too late
Your only hangup is you hesitate
It's just a bad bad dream
I'm getting it to you so you get it through you and make your choice
People start playing and back what you're saying in just one voice
It's just a bad bad dream
All my love's for you.
Still I think it's time you made up your own mind.
Still I'll wait for you.
Love is here for you.
Maybe I talk too slow.
But you've got to live a little bit faster
I ain't lost and I ain't searching.
But then you know me very well.
And I can't change the wind and make it blow the other way.
I'm a fool and I can tell.
That I'm alive and that's all.
That I can get up just as fast as I fall.
And I can walk and run but I'll never crawl.
And in the end it doesn't matter at all.
I don't know about the people that I read about in books.
And the Kings and Queens around my room with their quiet dirty looks.
I ain't lost and I ain't searching.
But then you know me very well.
And I can't change the world and make it go the other way.
I'm a fool and I can tell.
That I'm alive and that's all.
That I can get up just as fast as I fall.
And I can walk and run but I'll never crawl.
And in the end it doesn't matter at all.
I don't know about those people that I read about in books.
And the Kings and Queens around my room with their quiet dirty looks.
There's a reason for believing that I've never been alive.
I know I should be going somewhere I just can't arrive.
But I'm sure if I asked her she'll know.
I really really wanna go home.
Gave up when I got no reply.
But I'm sure if I don't ask her I'll die.
I really couldn't make her my wife.
But I'm sure if I asked her she'll know
I really couldn't make her my wife.
But I'm sure if I asked her she'll know.
I'm sure if I ask her she'll know.
I can feel you sweet song of summer
Your music comforts my lonely reign
I can hear you in evil darkness
I am your forever and this I emphasize
Your never ending hurting and criticize
We are friends forever and this is emphasize
Your never ending hurting and criticize
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I'm locked up I want to be free
Out in the courtyard and over the wall then
My friends are waiting for me
Sixteen people are waiting to get me
Hoping to take me outside
I went along for the ride
Wind in my face and my bones they are aching
My soul must weather the storm
I must run till my back it is breaking
Sixteen people are waiting to get me
Hoping to take me outside
I went along for the ride
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I went along for the ride
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
It's too late to turn back now
There ain't no space back there
And how did I begin to lose my self control
How did I begin to lose my self control
There ain't a thing that you could give me
With the love forever with me
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul
I don't wanna be the one
Remember it was only fun
I don't wanna be the guy to tell you things that make you cry
There ain't a thing that you could give me
With the love forever with me
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul
I don't wanna be the one
Remember it was only fun
I don't wanna be the guy to tell you things that make you cry
I don't wanna be the guy to tell you things that make you cry
You know as well as I know you're my only friend
You know as well as I know you're my only friend
You're my only friend
The sun shines down on a South Dakota morning
And I can see their faces in my eyes
I wish they were behind me
If only to remind me that I'm really not alone
All the South Dakota mornings I have known
The eagle flies on a South Dakota morning
And I don't see my eagle anymore
I think I saw the eagle just once more
The rain comes down on a South Dakota morning
And I can't see the sadness in my town
So let it be my pillow for underneath your willow
Wanna go back to you though your nothing but a town
If your happy and marching forward in your band
In my life I'm together on my own
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow
Will you show me someone who may treat me kind
Or is this world I live in just a frame of mind
If you're happy living down on the ground
Where the crippled and the blind alone can see
I got a feeling God is still around
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow
Will you show me someone who may treat me kind
Or is this world I live in just a frame of mind
Just a few nice words to get me through the day
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow
And will you show me someone who may treat me kind
Or is this world just a frame of mind
I cry tears of emotion to spread across the USA
Ain't no sunshine cowboy in your pockets
Baby you forgot your living
Someone covered up your eyes
In my way at least I'm giving what I love
There's gonna be some confusion
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes and you'll look to the skies
I am my father's son or that is what I heard
You got my face and I'll play your ace
Pretend I haven't heard
There's gonna be some confusion
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes and you'll look to the skies
I'll play inside your soul
I'll show you to yourself
Fill your head with wild emotions
There's gonna be some confusion
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes and you'll look to the skies
I will return to find out if the melody was wrong
There's gonna be some confusion
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes and you'll look to the skies
The sound of life erupts and fades and all the world must play along
My life has been a song
Inside my heart I softly keep the tune that plays too long
My life has been a song
That no little person like me could ever change
Is like a symphony symphony
Which has never before been rearranged
The sound of life erupts and fades and all the world must play along
My life has been a song
That no little person like me could ever change
Is like a symphony symphony
Which has never before been rearranged
The sound of life erupts and fades and all the world must play along
My life has been a song
That no little person like me could ever change
Is like a symphony symphony
I'm full of pride and my heart feels good
At last I can go back where I belong
Couldn't believe the voice in my ears
So I left the only folks I had known
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud
Couldn't get back and I couldn't go far
Said to myself stay right where you are
Done found yourself a Ma and Pa
Come home Johnny Bridie come home
Johnny Bridie come home
We're all wrong without you
How did we ever doubt you
He confessed to the killing
It's his role we had you filling
We didn't really mean to make you sad
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad
I left the only folks I had known
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud
Couldn't get back and I couldn't go far
Said to myself stay right where you are
Done found yourself a Ma and Pa
Come Home Johnny Bridie come home
Johnny Bridie come home
We're all wrong without you
How did we ever doubt you
He confessed to the killing
It's his role we had you filling
We didn't really mean to make you sad
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad
Come Home Johnny Bridie come home
Johnny Bridie come home
We're all wrong without you
How did we ever doubt you
He confessed to the killing
Like a woman in the rain
Tried to work out where I am
I close my mind for the day
Like a woman in the rain
There's never ever anybody to rely on
There isn't time to count the shoulders I have cried on
But I guess that's not true
And you know that's true
But there's a method to my madness
Like a woman in the rain
So I close my eyes for the day
I can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrow
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
You know I love getting up in the morning
When the sun first strikes the trees
All the morning birds that sing above
Still bring back memories
Of a girl who stood beside me
When the rights I did were wrong
But she went back down the river
Just when I thought I could be strong
She never told me why she left me
But the letter said goodbye
And my nights to reason why
Why a stranger comes to steal the love
Of a girl I had to hold
But she went back down the river
Just when I thought I could be strong
I am the searcher of my fortunes
I've got my right hand on the wheel
We've got to dig for buried treasures
I know exactly how I feel
Don't wanna live inside myself
I'm much better off alone
Don't wanna live inside myself
Where the darkness is my friend
I heard all about the beginning
I wanna see just where it ends
Don't wanna live inside myself
I'm much better off alone
Don't wanna live inside myself
I have fed the jaded tiger
And every tiger knows my name
I can tell myself my name
Don't wanna live inside myself
I'm much better off alone
She knows that life is a running race
Her face shouldn't show any signs
You can be beautiful too
You can be beautiful too
She knows that life is a running race
Her face shouldn't show any lines
You can be beautiful too
Don't shed a tear for me
If you're not here by me
Then it's not worth while
My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine
What do I do to have you stay
My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine
Don't shed a tear for me
That's not your style
If you're not here by me
Let it happen to me and you
I've got to give you my life
I'm tired of living without your giving
I've got to get you for my wife
Can't hold on much longer
The feeling's getting stronger
And let it be both of us
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
I see you every morning
Outside the restaurants
The music plays so nonchalant
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
You will see me at the time I love the best
In the daytime I will meet you as before.
Building castles in the shifting sands
In the morning of my life the
Minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day
To the top right hand corner of
The ceiling in my room
It is the morning of my life
It is the morning of my life
Oh my heart won't believe that you have left me
I keep telling my self that it's true
I can get over anything you want my love
But I can't get myself over you
Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
Don't forget to remember me my love
On my wall lies a photograph of you girl
Though I try to forget you somehow
You're the mirror of my soul so take me out of my hole
Let me try to go on living right now
Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
You should be here standing so near to me.
But give me time alone to get it out of my mind.
Though say I know it's only the weather.
And the sun will shine if just for you.
Trains walk by and the birds disappear.
But why am I still here without you by my side.
And the rain will fall.
And the clouds will break
And the sun will shine
If ever you've got rain in your heart
Someone has hurt you and torn you apart
To open up your eyes to love me
And let it be like they said it would be
To open up your eyes to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder
And when you're out in the cold
No one beside you and no one to hold
To open up your eyes to love me
And when you've got nothing to lose
Nothing to pay for and nothing to choose
To open up your eyes to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Run to me whenever you're lonely
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Run to me whenever you're lonely
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Everybody wants to leave
I have all year to smile
What makes the world go round
My mind is lost and found
And would I pray what makes the world go round
I'm a man for all seasons
I'm a man for all seasons
I'm a man for all seasons
Maybe I talk too slow.
But you've got to live a little bit faster
I ain't lost and I ain't searching.
But then you know me very well.
And I can't change the wind and make it blow the other way.
I'm a fool and I can tell.
That I'm alive and that's all.
That I can get up just as fast as I fall.
And I can walk and run but I'll never crawl.
And in the end it doesn't matter at all.
I don't know about the people that I read about in books.
And the Kings and Queens around my room with their quiet dirty looks.
I ain't lost and I ain't searching.
But then you know me very well.
And I can't change the world and make it go the other way.
I'm a fool and I can tell.
That I'm alive and that's all.
That I can get up just as fast as I fall.
And I can walk and run but I'll never crawl.
And in the end it doesn't matter at all.
I don't know about those people that I read about in books.
And the Kings and Queens around my room with their quiet dirty looks.
There's a reason for believing that I've never been alive.
I know I should be going somewhere I just can't arrive.
Maybe there's a reason why we broke up
I could dedicate my life to something new
But I must have been asleep but then I woke up
Working out why I was still with you
All the things I wish I could have been
And I would be respected
I would get a reputation
Midnight stars are shining on my shoeshine
Telling me the things I'm gonna be
And the world is gonna fall in love with me
All the things I wish I could have been
And I would be respected
I would get a reputation
Some nights we made our love in the sand
And at the dark we held our love hand in hand
And we listened to music the ocean was playing
The words that our two hearts were saying
That only two lovers can make
Let us ride on the wind while this moment is real
Your the light of my life
You are welcome to my Charade
And this feeling knowing you blessed me forever
And believing I have been touch by your love
And the pleasure of knowing the evening won't tare us apart
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone
We can gaze up the sky till the night is over
You are welcome to my Charade
And this feeling knowing you blessed me forever
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone
We can gaze at the sky till the night is over
You are welcome to my Charade
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone
We can gaze at the sky till the night is over
If I stood up and looked around
I'd see a brand new face staring right back at me
That I'm taller then I was before
Building a brand new bridge into sincerity
And can't believe what they're saying in the overground
Throw a penny for my children going down
Listen to the wise man as he breathes
At night I turn my face into the wind
Make it easy to be understood
I see a velvet day breaking across the sky
I am taller then I was before
Building a brand new bridge
Throw a penny for my children they are going down
And I can't believe what they're saying in the overground
Throw a penny for my children going down
I don't need anybody . I don't need anyone.
I'd show my body anywhere.
Ain't no big city winner's gonna pass my buck anywhere.
Ain't no four leaf clover's gonna settle my luck and I don't care.
Go down to the courthouse and I've been on display.
Don't you think that I don't know
I'd sell my body anywhere.
Ain't no easy rider gonna settle my luck and I don't care
Been rejuvenated to the highest degree.
Ain't no words describing what this feeling's done to me and I don't care.
I'd show my feelings anywhere.
Ain't no heavy Mister Leather's gonna paddle my butt anywhere
Ain't no four leaf clover's gonna settle my luck and I don't care.
Oh my children stand by me till my story's over
If I were you and you were me those voices they would cease to be
They won't be free to torment me again
They spoke of darkness and of light
They spoke of weakness and of might
The spoke of people in the snow
And distant places long ago
The spoke of fire and falling rain
Of health and wealth and death and pain
If I were you and you were me those voices they would cease to be
They won't be free to torment me again
But in my bed again last night those voices spoke of wrong and right
They spoke of darkness and of light
They spoke of weakness and of might
They spoke of people in the snow
And distant places long ago
They spoke of fire and falling rain
Of health and wealth and death and pain
They spoke of people in the snow
And distant places long ago
They spoke of fire and falling rain
Of health and wealth and death and pain
I wish the world was run by all the little children
We could be happy once again
We won't hurt when we're like little children
And we won't ever feel the pain
Now when my fight for life on earth is over
All my love belongs to you hereafter
And we'll all join hand another day
I told you a million times now
Now do you believe the words I say
All my life belongs to you hereafter
And we'll all join hands another day
Couldn't make it to the place he'd like to be
Keeping other dogs like him for company
In the evening I'd go down to a nightclub in the town
Try to get some bread to make another way
You know he's lived a thousand years day to day
And you never learn to know
Could it ever really show
And at this moment in time you couldn't make up your mind
Now could you ever understand
Are you following me just like Moses to the sea
Do you think I'll give you freedom in the end
When I'm long dead and gone will your love for me go on
Will I be the one you run to in the end
And all my dogs need a friend
When I heard somebody call outside my door
Well the days get shorter and the nights get longer
And you never learn to know
Could it ever really show
And at this moment in time you couldn't make up your mind
Now could you ever understand
Are you following me just like Moses to the sea
Do you think I'll give you freedom in the end
When I'm long dead and gone will your love for me go on
Will I be the one you run to in the end
And all my dogs need a friend
I still remember all of those little things.
With my heart and it won't sing.
Yes. I'm dying and there ain't no doubt.
Well I try try try try try
When I walk in the rain you won't know that I'm crying.
A smile on my face and I'm trying.
I'm trying to understand that a love that is lost can never be found again.
You know he knew you more then me.
I went home laughing and inside I'm crying.
We had a special thing.
With my heart and it won't sing.
You know my heart just won't sing.
Well I try try try try try.
When I walk in the rain you won't know that I'm crying.
A smile on my face and I'm trying.
I'm trying to understand that a love that is lost can never be found again.
Still I try try try try try.
Well I try try try try try
Still I try try try try try.
Well I try try try try try
I was lost in your love
I was held by your heart
And no secrets stood between us anymore
I'm like a child learning pain
I was held by your chains
For all the bad times I've put you through
On the chance that I could make you mine
There's not a thing I would not do
And wrong or right I'll be with you and lost in your love
I was lost in your love
I was held by your heart
And no secrets stood between us anymore
I'm like a child learning pain
I was held by your chains
Now I will follow you where the wild bird flies
Through endless skies I will go
So I can be so near you girl and all of this you gotta know
That when I get you here inside my arms
I never ever ever will let you go
And wrong or right I'll be with you and lost in your love
I was lost in your love
I was held by your heart
And no secrets stood between us anymore
I'm like a child learning pain
I was held by your chains
Or tell me you're my virgin queen and it may not be right.
And it's breaking me down
Just thinking of your face and it won't be around
When all this world of ours is falling apart
I'll keep on hanging on and fixing my heart
And I may be that lucky man surviving when they're gone
And it's breaking me down
Just thinking of your face and it won't be around
Ain't no satisfaction in this troubled head of mine.
And I don't know where I'm gonna start.
It's only heavy breathing in the dark.
I'd be the last man to blow my cool.
I feel my body shake.
And I don't know where I'm gonna start.
It's only heavy breathing in the dark.
And I don't know where I'm gonna start.
Only heavy breathing in the dark.
Only heavy breathing in the dark.
It's only heavy breathing in the dark.
You know there's got to be a way better than a big black hole.
Gotta take me from my suicide.
Now you know it's love I crave.
You know we got to live like this from the cradle to the grave.
I'm so so so so tired.
I've given all my love away and I've been left with none
But can you say that I'm to blame for loving anyone
I used to think that I was always older then my time
And fate no longer has the faith to walk ahead of me
I always used to think that I was better then my kind
In a room full of strangers
Where your eyes couldn't see me
Though you did not want me to
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them love songs
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them sweet sounds
There are so many others
How long will they stand between us
Though you did not want me to
Singing them love songs
Singing them sweet sounds
Even if it takes forever
Even if it takes a lifetime
Somehow I feel inside
Make it like it was before
Even if it takes a lifetime
You're really no good
Just what you mean to me
You're gonna take away my energy
Still gets in my eyes
There you go with your fancy lies
You just ain't no good
And if there's somebody
Still gets in my eyes
Nobody believe what you say
And if there's somebody
In the streets of New York City
And I don't want no pity
But I want my story told
When the lights shine down on me
They shine on the little boy
Is this way to make him pay
He don't know where he'll go wrong
He won't cry so many tears
Till he finds out why he don't belong like me
There's no room for us out there
You can lose your hope and pride
When it comes to broken dreams
You'll get your share
Sometime a man breaks down
And the good things he is looking for
Are crushed into the ground
Can't you see the wind of change
We need a god down there
A man to lead us children
Take us from the valley of fear
Make the lights shine down on us
Show us the road to go
Teach us what we need to know
He don't know where he'll go wrong
He won't cry so many tears
Till he finds out why he don't belong like me
There's no room for us out there
You can lose your hope and pride
When it comes to broken dreams
You'll get your share
And the good things he is searching for
Are crushed into the ground
Can't you see the wind of change
Can't you see the wind of change
Can't you see the wind of change
Can't you see the wind of change
Though your wings are broken the sky is so wide open
And the wind is waiting for you like an open door
You'll never really ever know how beautiful you are
When the moon is on the rise I'll try to make my songbird fly
Though your wings are broken the sky is so wide open
And the wind is waiting for you like an open door
You'll never really ever know how beautiful you are
When the moon is on the rise I'll try to make my songbird fly
Seems like you don't want
The love of this man at all
And it's sure been a lonely time
Right up to the time I met you
So if you take a love like mine
You know how easy it is to hurt me
And my love won't desert me
So you say to yourself
Do you think I'm gonna stand here
And it's the start of a love affair
The moment when I first met you
You know how easy it is to break me
And my love won't forsake me
You'll always love me forever
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
And my love won't forsake me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
And my love won't forsake me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
And my love won't desert me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
And my love won't forsake me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
It's just the wine and all this making love
It's just the wine and all this making love
I try to make it seem it isn't just a dream
It isn't fair to wake up all this making love
It's just the wine and all this making love
She'll be making me strung by the tip of my tongue like a tiger in a cage
It's just the wine and all this making love.
Soft is the cool summer breeze when I saw your face
I saw the light in your eyes so dark and demanding
Like a light in the storm
Whenever I cry my friend
You're always away and so I pretend
If I could live the dreams that I see
I'll never belong to someone again
Living my whole life through
Long live my love for you
And all things seem clear to me now
Like a light in the storm
Whenever I cry my friend
You're always away and so I pretend
If I could live the dreams that I see
I'll never belong to someone again
Living my whole life through
I'll never belong to someone again
Living my whole life through
If my life gets like a jig saw
Put a smile back on my face.
And if all my bad days came at once
You would know just what to do.
You can dry away my tears.
You know I will be here.
So bring your love around.
When I can not see in front of me
You can take it all away.
You can dry away my tears.
You know I will be here.
So bring your love around.
At the edge of the universe.
And I know it'll make her worse.
Now I look out on forever
And it must be nice down there.
But I'm only three feet wide.
And I live inside an ocean that flows
And it looks like it's gonna be a lovely afternoon.
It's been my longest journey
And I've come through the black of night.
I was tired and hungry
When I saw your distant light.
But I'm sure I got here first.
At the edge of the universe.
At the edge of the universe.
And I know it'll make her worse.
Now I look out on forever
And it must be nice down there.
One shadow of the man I used to be.
Still praying you will soon come back to me.
I will always think of what we had together.
You stay as you turn away.
Another place where I can hide.
Except without your love I'm dead inside.
I will always think of what we had together.
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
She's juicy and she's trouble
She gets it to me good
My woman give me power
Goes right down to my blood
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
You stepped into my life
You stepped into my life
You stepped into my life
Before you came my way
That I'd believe in love so much.
You stepped into my life
You stepped into my life
You stepped into my life
You gave me so much more
My love is worthy of.
I kneel before your touch.
She came on like the night and she held on tight
And the world was right when she made love to me
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up
I was here and she was gone
Maybe you can tell me
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong
Where did she go when I need her close to me
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart
I could take it in my stride
Start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size
Wanna be a part of you
And together we can touch the sky
We can make it if we really try
Wanna be a part of you
Yesterday I had a feeling of a flame of burning desire
And you know we can make it if we really try
Wanna be a part of you
Yesterday I had a vision of a flame of burning desire
And you know we can make it if we really try
Oh together you and i
When you got a good woman to keep it up
When love is the question I got enough
A love like yours and mine
When you got a good woman to keep it up
When love is the question I got enough
When you got a good woman to keep it up
When love is the question I got enough
A love like yours and mine
When you got a good woman to keep it up
When you move it like you really know how to move me
I follow you wherever you go
Come on boogie child let your love light shine
I remember times my love when we really had it all
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
All I ever wanted was to have you to myself
Then I see you standing there in the arms of someone else
You know a man can stand so much
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Never even try to see things her way
It's hard on a woman when love ain't no love at all
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
I think I can work it out
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Together we can make it
Gimme some loving in the morning
I got to make it to the midnight train
So take me to the subway
I got to make it to the midnight train
So take me to the subway
They keep appearing in my eyes
Such a warm and tender glow
For just one moment I remember all
The love we had was never all that bad
There were smiles and there were tears
Two strangers reaching for a worthless cause
Or even justify the end
You meant so very much to me
The love we had was never all that bad
There were smiles and there were tears
Till that special summer day
Two strangers reaching for a worthless cause
When you move it like you really know how to move me
I follow you wherever you go
Watching every day go by.
Keeps us all anticipating.
Every man's a boy deep down.
There ain't no easy way.
Like the breath of a child
From the moment he's born
When the curtains are drawn.
We are children of the world
From arrival to survival
Just to make it worth the waiting.
We are faces in the night
Watching every day go by.
There ain't no easy way.
In the back of your mind
There is always a mark.
There's a wandering solo
You can keep it forever
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by.
Keeps us all anticipating.
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by.
Like the breath of a child
From the moment he's born
Till the very last day
When the curtains are drawn.
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by.
Keeps us all anticipating.
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by.
The preacher talked to me and he smiled
Now for once in your life you're alone
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I told him I'm in no hurry
And for once in my life I'm alone
And I've got to let her know just in time before I go
I've just go to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I've just got to get a message to her
One more hour and my life will be through
She came on like the night and she held on tight
And the world was right when she made love to me
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up
I was here and she was gone
Maybe you can tell me
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong
Where did she go when I need her close to me
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart
I could take it in my stride
Start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size
At the edge of the universe.
And I know it'll make her worse.
Now I look out on forever
And it must be nice down there.
But I'm only three feet wide.
And I live inside an ocean that flows
And it looks like it's gonna be a lovely afternoon.
It's been my longest journey
And I've come through the black of night.
I was tired and hungry
When I saw your distant light.
But I'm sure I got here first.
At the edge of the universe.
At the edge of the universe.
And I know it'll make her worse.
Now I look out on forever
And it must be nice down there.
If my life gets like a jig saw
Put a smile back on my face.
And if all my bad days came at once
You would know just what to do.
You can dry away my tears.
You know I will be here.
So bring your love around.
When I can not see in front of me
You can take it all away.
You can dry away my tears.
You know I will be here.
So bring your love around.
When you got a good woman to keep it up
When love is the question I got enough
A love like yours and mine
When you got a good woman to keep it up
When love is the question I got enough
When you got a good woman to keep it up
When love is the question I got enough
A love like yours and mine
When you got a good woman to keep it up
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
It's something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Ooh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
Can't think what I've just said
Put the soft pillow on my head
Millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
Yet millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
It's something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
She's juicy and she's trouble
She gets it to me good
My woman give me power
Goes right down to my blood
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
When you move it like you really know how to move me
I follow you wherever you go
Come on boogie child let your love light shine
I don't need anybody . I don't need anyone.
I'd show my body anywhere.
Ain't no big city winner's gonna pass my buck anywhere.
Ain't no four leaf clover's gonna settle my luck and I don't care.
Go down to the courthouse and I've been on display.
Don't you think that I don't know
I'd sell my body anywhere.
Ain't no easy rider gonna settle my luck and I don't care
Been rejuvenated to the highest degree.
Ain't no words describing what this feeling's done to me and I don't care.
I'd show my feelings anywhere.
Ain't no heavy Mister Leather's gonna paddle my butt anywhere
Ain't no four leaf clover's gonna settle my luck and I don't care.
Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
Cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory
Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
To take your heart away
In the streets of New York City
And I don't want no pity
But I want my story told
When the lights shine down on me
They shine on the little boy
Is this way to make him pay
He don't know where he'll go wrong
He won't cry so many tears
Till he finds out why he don't belong like me
There's no room for us out there
You can lose your hope and pride
When it comes to broken dreams
You'll get your share
Sometime a man breaks down
And the good things he is looking for
Are crushed into the ground
Can't you see the wind of change
We need a god down there
A man to lead us children
Take us from the valley of fear
Make the lights shine down on us

You can lose your hope and pride
When it comes to broken dreams
You'll get your share
And the good things he is searching for

Can't you see the wind of change
Can't you see the wind of change
Can't you see the wind of change
Can't you see the wind of change
In a room full of strangers
Where your eyes couldn't see me
Though you did not want me to
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them love songs
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them sweet sounds
There are so many others
How long will they stand between us
Though you did not want me to
Singing them love songs
Singing them sweet sounds
Even if it takes forever
Even if it takes a lifetime
Somehow I feel inside
Make it like it was before
Even if it takes a lifetime
You're really no good
Just what you mean to me
You're gonna take away my energy
Still gets in my eyes
There you go with your fancy lies
You just ain't no good
And if there's somebody
Still gets in my eyes
Nobody believe what you say
And if there's somebody
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
I see you every morning
Outside the restaurants
The music plays so nonchalant
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Here I lie in a lost and lonely part of town
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and you don't know why
Night and day there's a burning down inside of me
Burning love with a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go and I just can't take it all alone
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more
I can see beyond forever
Everything we own will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night or day
And the tears we had to cry
I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we own will never die
When you are to me the light above
Made for all to see our precious love
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Love is such a beautiful thing
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Your kisses taste like honey
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Too many heartaches in one lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Don't try to tell me it's all over
No man could love you more
You can't change the way I feel inside
You are the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
No man on earth can stand between my love and I
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
Just the way I feel today
Living my life without you
Living my life without you
Living on the one I love
What I got is not enough
Living my life without you
Living my life forever
Living my life forever
I never fell in love so easily.
Where the four winds blow I carry on.
Through the empty skies.
Faster than lightening is this heart of mine.
In the face of time I carry on.
I'd like to take you where my rainbow ends.
Your fire in the sun.
It's the dawn of the feeling
That starts from the moment you're there.
You'll never know what you have done for me.
You broke all those rules I live upon.
Your fire in the sun.
It's the dawn of the feeling
That starts from the moment you're there.
There I'd like to take you where my spirit flies
Through the empty skies.
Look to the road that lies ahead
I'm turning to the dream we left to die
Don't lose the will to make it right
A day is just a brighter night
And rise above to be all that we are
From daybreak to sunset you are the heart of me
Saying what you don't really mean
Now I know where you go and all the plans you made
Playing for a love not a dream
All that I want is you now and somehow I let you down
Midnight you leave me taking the part of me
I got nothing to be living for
I lay my heart on you and you can show the way
I give my everlasting love until my dying day
A chance to make you mine
I lay my body on the line
My life was emptiness until you came along
I need all of you to get me through the night
A chance to see the light
I lay my body on the line
And you came to me alone girl
I was a heart that's made of stone girl
And you broke it down in pieces
And you took me for your own girl
I lie beneath your ecstasy
You can pour it all over me
I won't break the chains of loving you
Before you took me by the hand girl
I was a statue in the sand girl
I was broken down for reasons
You could never understand girl
I was living on desire
But that was just the way we were
Till you make a world of love in you
You were a lovely child
And your hair was like the morning sun
And I knew we were in love
We were alone to dream a dream
We held our love that held our hearts
And who are we who knew
All there was in life and coming through
We held our love and that held our hearts
You're really no good
Just what you mean to me
You're gonna take away my energy
Still gets in my eyes
There you go with your fancy lies
You just ain't no good
And if there's somebody
Still gets in my eyes
Nobody believe what you say
And if there's somebody
There is movement all around
On the waves of the air
If it's something we can share
And that sweet city woman
She move through the light
We know how to show it
We know how to show it
In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
I got fire in my mind
And I'm glowing in the dark
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
We know how to show it
Here I lie in a lost and lonely part of town
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and you don't know why
Night and day there's a burning down inside of me
Burning love with a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go and I just can't take it all alone
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
She's juicy and she's trouble
She gets it to me good
My woman give me power
Goes right down to my blood
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Well now I get low and I get high
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'll live to see another day
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you can look the other way
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
You know the door to my very soul
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
She came on like the night and she held on tight
And the world was right when she made love to me
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up
I was here and she was gone
Maybe you can tell me
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong
Where did she go when I need her close to me
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart
I could take it in my stride
Start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more
I can see beyond forever
Everything we own will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night or day
And the tears we had to cry
I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we own will never die
When you are to me the light above
Made for all to see our precious love
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Love is such a beautiful thing
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Maybe I don't wanna know the reason why
But lately you don't talk to me
Darling I can't see me in your eyes
I hold you near but you're so far away
And it's losing you I can't believe
To watch you leave and let this feeling die
You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
And tomorrow if I'm here without your love
You know I can't survive
Only my love can raise you high above it all
We can take the darkness and make if full of light
But let your love flow back to me
How can you leave and let this feeling die
This happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone
And I won't even have your shoulders for the crying on
We changed the world we made it ours to hold
But dreams are made for those who really try
This losing you is real
But I still feel you here inside
Seems like you don't want
The love of this man at all
And it's sure been a lonely time
Right up to the time I met you
So if you take a love like mine
You know how easy it is to hurt me
And my love won't desert me
So you say to yourself
Do you think I'm gonna stand here
And it's the start of a love affair
The moment when I first met you
You know how easy it is to break me
And my love won't forsake me
You'll always love me forever
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
And my love won't forsake me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
And my love won't forsake me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
And my love won't desert me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
And my love won't forsake me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
And it just don't matter how I cry
My tears of love are a waste of time
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
And it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily
To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
You stepped into my life
You stepped into my life
You stepped into my life
Before you came my way
That I'd believe in love so much.
You stepped into my life
You stepped into my life
You stepped into my life
You gave me so much more
My love is worthy of.
I kneel before your touch.
I remember times my love when we really had it all
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
All I ever wanted was to have you to myself
Then I see you standing there in the arms of someone else
You know a man can stand so much
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Never even try to see things her way
It's hard on a woman when love ain't no love at all
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
I think I can work it out
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Together we can make it
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you
Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love I know I would die
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
Maybe you don't know me anymore then I know you
And I wouldn't blame you if you walked away
And it touches me much more then I can say
You know I'd hate to think that someone
Could have hurt someone like you
Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
Saw you in the corner on the moment I walked in
Saw your lonely face across the room
And the way it might have been
Why did you have to leave so soon
You know I'd hate to think that someone
Could have loved you more than me
And at times like this I'd be right by your side
Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
How long must I wait for the last train to be here
And the last chance to know
Get to think that I was born too soon
I was there when you left me
Just didn't know how to begin
Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket
In a room full of strangers
Where your eyes couldn't see me
Though you did not want me to
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them love songs
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them sweet sounds
There are so many others
How long will they stand between us
Though you did not want me to
Singing them love songs
Singing them sweet sounds
Even if it takes forever
Even if it takes a lifetime
Somehow I feel inside
Make it like it was before
Even if it takes a lifetime
I never fell in love so easily.
Where the four winds blow I carry on.
Through the empty skies.
Faster than lightening is this heart of mine.
In the face of time I carry on.
I'd like to take you where my rainbow ends.
Your fire in the sun.
It's the dawn of the feeling
That starts from the moment you're there.
You'll never know what you have done for me.
You broke all those rules I live upon.
Your fire in the sun.
It's the dawn of the feeling
That starts from the moment you're there.
There I'd like to take you where my spirit flies
Through the empty skies.
Your kisses taste like honey
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Too many heartaches in one lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Don't try to tell me it's all over
No man could love you more
You can't change the way I feel inside
You are the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
No man on earth can stand between my love and I
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
In the streets of New York City
And I don't want no pity
But I want my story told
When the lights shine down on me
They shine on the little boy
Is this way to make him pay
He don't know where he'll go wrong
He won't cry so many tears
Till he finds out why he don't belong like me
There's no room for us out there
You can lose your hope and pride
When it comes to broken dreams
You'll get your share
Sometime a man breaks down
And the good things he is looking for
Are crushed into the ground
Can't you see the wind of change
We need a god down there
A man to lead us children
Take us from the valley of fear
Make the lights shine down on us
Show us the road to go
Teach us what we need to know
He don't know where he'll go wrong
He won't cry so many tears
Till he finds out why he don't belong like me
There's no room for us out there
You can lose your hope and pride
When it comes to broken dreams
You'll get your share
And the good things he is searching for
Are crushed into the ground
Can't you see the wind of change
Can't you see the wind of change
Can't you see the wind of change
Can't you see the wind of change
Watching every day go by.
Keeps us all anticipating.
Every man's a boy deep down.
There ain't no easy way.
Like the breath of a child
From the moment he's born
When the curtains are drawn.
We are children of the world
From arrival to survival
Just to make it worth the waiting.
We are faces in the night
Watching every day go by.
There ain't no easy way.
In the back of your mind
There is always a mark.
There's a wandering solo
You can keep it forever
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by.
Keeps us all anticipating.
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by.
Like the breath of a child
From the moment he's born
Till the very last day
When the curtains are drawn.
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by.
Keeps us all anticipating.
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by.
Now I bring emotion and I bring desire
And I bring the potion to set you on fire
You got me held inside your love and I can't get out
We must surrender to the powers that be
The angel in you and the devil in me
And we both know what's coming
We got one thing in mind
Why are we waiting for this love on the rise
And why am I searching for the magic that's in your eyes
We must surrender to the powers that be
The angel in you and the devil in me
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Well now I get low and I get high
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'll live to see another day
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you can look the other way
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
She's juicy and she's trouble
She gets it to me good
My woman give me power
Goes right down to my blood
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
And it just don't matter how I cry
My tears of love are a waste of time
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
And it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily
To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
There is movement all around
On the waves of the air
If it's something we can share
And that sweet city woman
She move through the light
We know how to show it
We know how to show it
In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
I got fire in my mind
And I'm glowing in the dark
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
We know how to show it
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
You know the door to my very soul
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Well now I get low and I get high
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'll live to see another day
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me

But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life

Just a minute at a time
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
Would you believe me if I told you your tomorrow is my yesterday
In the beginning I was far away and praying for my destiny
The moment you're born
For we will be here when the miracle comes
The state of my heart
The day I deny the face of my love
Right now when the power is mine
I leave you heaven and the earth
And living to love is the reason we shine
When I been over I been under
I don't own a dream to analyze
But living eyes you know that I do
Believe in the soul and the magic of you
The state of my heart
The day I deny the face of my love
Right now when the power is mine
I leave you heaven and the earth
And living to love is the reason we shine
When under the sun don't cry
The state of my heart
I was stood by the light as I looked through the window
With the greatest intention not meaning to see
I was there in the dark and I saw you together
Get the cards on the table
You've got to be cruel to be kind
He's a liar and I should know liar
There was smoke in the air and sweet smell of leather
I was through the window and down in the street
And it's not how I want it to be
There's a hand on my shoulder
Was it not for the man that was blocking the drive
Was it not for the red limousine
I'd be millions of miles from th scene of the crime
And I should know liar
Lonely people gathering there to be one
Gonna be the last time wasted
Gonna be seen to be gone
Run a mile for the minute
Gonna mind another day without you in it
You promised me paradise
Don't go back on your word
You promised me paradise
All my days of loving you under my skin
Gonna be a wild wild world
When nobody wants to give in
Gonna call me on the hour
Gonna mind if I don't hear it
I would hate to be you
You promised me paradise
Don't go back on your word
You promised me paradise
Can you tell me if there's gonna be another reason to cry
Will I be the last to know
Unless we make another way of doing what we do
We won't believe it anymore
Will I be the one to cry
Gonna be a wild world
Let me hide away under your bed
Run a mile for the minute
Gonna mind another day without you in it
You promised me paradise
Don't go back on your word
You promised me paradise
You promised me paradise
Don't fall in love with me baby
It's a love that just won't last.
But you see the past.
You know love was made for a dreamer
But when the dream is out of sight
Saving it all for something wild and wonderful
There's gotta be another horizon
Don't throw away your precious love
Not a prison of love that you make it
Don't fall in love with me baby
It's a love that just won't last
Your eyes are looking out at the future
You know hearts are made to be broken
And your love has broken mine
Now all your gonna get in the morning is a lonely night
Nothing but a lonely night
Gonna be a lonely night
You're gonna be blue...
Ooh... ooh... woo woo... ooh
Gonna be a lonely night
Nothing but a lonely night
Saving it all for something wild and wonderful
Don't throw away your precious love
Not a prison of love that you make it
Don't fall in love with me baby
It's a love that just won't last
You know love was made for a dreamer
And your love has broken mine
Now all your gonna get in the morning is a lonely night
Nothing but a lonely night
Gonna be a lonely night
You're gonna be blue... ooh... woo... ooh
Gonna be a lonely night
Nothing but a lonely night
Carry my sacrifice for the sake of the millions
All night you be the light on the water
You be the pride and the sorrow
Shower your love to me there
Summer died before the rain
Unify every soul together be lonely
Ride on follow me to the sunrise
Save me the world that is broken
Nothing but love to be there
You'll never be far away
I will walk through the fire
Nothing but love to be there
I'm a little misunderstood
Living all the daydreams and nightmares
I'm a little bit on the moon
No moment is too soon
All night give me the light on the water
Give me the pride and the sorrow
Showing your love to me there
Close your eyes do what you wanna
Baby how can I wait much longer
Make it hard to believe it happened to me
Morning comes too late tomorrow
All you lose is the dream you borrow
All you got is a soul that's born to be free
And cries to the wind
My dream will find you someday
I stand beside my vision of you
And have you loving me
Though you're my imagination
You be there when we find salvation
Only then will there be no reason to hide
Stormy night out in the heaven
I believe in the true forever
There's a bright new star when somebody dies
Sweet love returning someday
The day you learn love happened to you
You will be here with me
I'll be waiting for you
Sweet love returning someday
The day you learn love happened to you
You will be here with me
Sacrifice everything in a wonderland that you know
It's crazy that I'm clear out of my mind
A wonderful place to be
Sweet as the morning light
If I blink an eye will you go
I'm starting to care much more then I dare
A wonderful thing to see
First say you love me
And then say you leave me
But we never say goodbye
But even an angel must choose
Someone will hurt you and when you stop running
There's only this love of mine
Sacrifice everything in a wonderland that you know
One look in your eyes
I'm younger then I should be
First say you love me and then say you'll leave me
But we never say goodbye
But only an angel must choose
Someone will hurt you and when you stop running
One is just enough for two
When do I learn young fingers get burned
Windy day we never knew
Now nothing can stand the way it was planned
Nothing could be good as
Even tho you're far away
You're movie plays in my mind
You're world is what you see
And I can make you warm at night
But I need to be sure you got love enough to know
And when every cloud has lost it's glow
When do I hide that feeling inside
Nothing could be good as
Even tho your far way your movie plays in my mind
Your world is what you see
And I can make you warm at night
But I need to be sure you got love enough to know
And when everyone has gone away
I wasn't born to be alone that was a lesson I was shown
To know that love was just a lie
I ran away to think it over
But it's over and I try to take a stand on what is real
Someone has shown me how to feel
I'm like a shadow in the night
I'm like a river in an ocean
I'm a flame without a light
Well your love is a cathedral and I came down here to pray
Can there be any wonder why to be living under
Love is a revelation only few can share
I could be a mountain strong but the pain about you
Long as I live without you
I would still be there
All the faces and the places that our love has ever been
Well your love is a cathedral and I came down here to pray
Can there be any wonder why to be living under
Love is a revelation only few can share
I could be a mountain strong but the pain about you
Long as I live without you I would still be there
I wasn't born to be a fool but I'm a fool to be around
I'm a man without a country I'm a King without a crown
But if anyone belongs to anybody you were mine
Well your love is a cathedral and I came down here to pray
The world was made to measure for your smile
I never been alone with you
That love will find a way
And love will never be set free
I won't ever let you be
You could not understand
I bless I bless your name
And all that summer madness caused the rain
The glory that we made
My love will grace the halls of time
A love that never can be mine
You could not love me then
Seize life and find a way
And I will be that shadow loving who you are
What am I supposed to do.
What am I supposed to do
Couldn't figure why you couldn't give me what everybody needs
Find out everybody knows that you've been using me
I'm surprised you let me stay around you
One day I'm gonna lift the cover and look inside your heart
We've got a little bit before we go and tear this love apart
This battle of love with me
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
I'm gonna hit you from all sides
Lay your fortress open wide
Nobody stops this body from taking you
I'm gonna be there one day when you fall
I could never let you cast aside
The greatest love of all
This battle of love with me
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
One fundamental sign of life
The tears that you cry
Only the strong survive
But power has a price
Ain't it time that you believe in someone
Ain't it wrong to let the years go by
Standing face to face forever
I'm not alive until you do
What you hold in your hand is a miracle
And it's dead if I don't have you
Swear you never let go
You're the eye of the storm
The reason I laugh or cry
One fundamental sign of life
No pain can make you draw the knife
We got a world of trouble
But I will never change
And even if we fall tomorrow
Now is the time we show each other
These are the words I kept inside
Standing face to face forever
I'm not alive until you do
What you hold in your hand is a miracle
And it's dead if I don't have you
Swear you never let go
You're the eye of the storm
The reason I laugh or cry
One fundamental sign of life
We love each other live or die
I'm not alive until you do
One fundamental sign of life
We love each other live or die
There's a young girl lost
When you're upside down
You just keep it inside...
You know we all cry...
And the promise that we won't be
Don't leave me waiting in line
The ghost is waiting outside
I'm searching so high
I'm searching so high
You know a love so fine
Goes on forever but the road is rough
Try to live without it
We don't talk about it
We can love each other when the lights go out
Anyone can see I'm walking alone
In your quiet moments
In your silent prayer
I'll be with you baby
On your longest night
I'll be with you baby
On your longest night
You know it breaks my heart
And it hurts my pride
To know I lost you to the world outside
Feeling when you touch me
Try to live without it
We don't talk about it
We can love each other
When the candle glows
And the moment is gone
On your longest night
I'll be with you baby
And it makes me wanna die
In your quiet moments
In your silent prayer
I'll be with you baby
On your longest night
I'll be with you baby
Something that I hunger for
You say I'm bad for you
Don't you know that all you gotta do
It's who you do it for
It's the pain and pleasure
If you try to help someone
You say you suffocate
Don't you know that all you gotta do
How soft the flesh is
That's who you do it for
It's the pain and the pleasure
As something in space
Not enough for everyone
Everyone and as we speak
The enemy is the mind
I see the future coming for you
All the lonely days and the lonely nights
You've been searching for a love so right
What you doing on your back
Ain't too much heaven on
Tell me now how deep is your love
But the brain is tough
The enemy is the mind
Don't let the future fall apart
If you ever wanna mend that broken heart
I have seen those nights on Broadway too
How soft the flesh is
It's who you do it for
It's the pain and pleasure
The darkness in the way
All the pain don't get no better
It gets stronger every day
It happens to be true
That I still pray to you my love
And high above the storm
You've got to imagine us
All the world was on our side
We had the power of the universe
We were ready for the ride
Moonlight in her hair
Her eyes the wonder of the age
But all I mean to you my love
Is just a spotlight on an empty stage
I can't stop my heart
They say a fool never learns
You agree I'm not superstitious
You know unlucky as I've been
And you can tell me to go
I've been reading your true confessions
But then you don't believe I'd let
Sorry that I've been so far away
You know I'm only human
It's the call of the wild
It's the law of the jungle
Won't you stay with me overnight
Give a little bit to you
Won't you stay with me stay
Won't you stay with me overnight
It'll be forever if you stay with me
As long as time will allow
You'll be losing your inhibitions
One night is not enough
For all the love to grow
And baby you and I rule the world
Maybe I could be your magician
Just give me long enough
Live in every corner of your heart
You know I'm only human
It's the call of the wild
It's the law of the jungle
Won't you stay with me overnight
Give a little bit to you
Won't you stay with me stay
Won't you stay with me overnight
It'll be forever if you stay with me
Stay with me overnight
Stay with me overnight
Stay with me overnight
Never get enough I'm crazy for your love
Never get enough I'm crazy
A mission that you keep to the letter
Why a man can stand for so much pain
You know the time is right
I feel my knees start shaking
And I can't stop running
You don't know but the word is out
I go crazy for your love
I go crazy for your love
Don't wanna fight it and I'm giving up
Lips all ready to burn
Never get enough I'm crazy for your love
Never get enough I'm crazy
I turn the television on
It's your face that I see on the screen
Replacing all the other ones
Reminds me that I need to be
The place is here and now
The brain is past controlling and
You don't know but the word is out
I go crazy for your love
I go crazy for your love
I go crazy for your fingers up and down my spine
Lips all ready to burn
Don't need a doctor when I'm almost dying
Never get enough I'm crazy for your love
Never get enough I'm crazy
Lips all ready to burn
You don't know but you're number 1
I go crazy for your love
You give me feelings that I
Couldn't get from anyone
You're gonna fix my heart
You're gonna free my soul
I'm gonna join your club
You give me love and there's
And I'm giving my love to you
And I'm still turning
And I'm still turning
The rhythm got me paralyzed
Of being there before
The few of us can find
You're gonna break my will
You're gonna take me down
When the two of us can steal
And I could be a king for you
And I'm still turning
And I'm still turning
I was so disorganized
Rhythm cut me down to size
Help me I'm in trouble deep
There may be love on the street
You got me drowning in my sleep
But I will find you when I wake
Love with no shape or form
I am in your mind's eye
There'll be one small light
All over the world tonight.
It will love with no name
And we glowed in the sun.
There was one small dream
Ordinary people living ordinary lives.
Ordinary people living ordinary lives.
Living ordinary lives
What else could we do
What else could we do
Just as my life fades to darkness
You you make me see the light.
Show me that my search is over
Someone can love so completely
One kiss should break the seal.
Truth can be stranger than fiction
You'll be my only possession
I'll be a slave to you
We hold the power together
And every breath you take is planned
It hurts me when you cry
When you feel the love is gone.
Don't give up on us when you got so much to believe in.
And so I beg you please stay yeah.
A flame that never dies
In a world of lonely faces
A love like yours should never live alone.
It's only you and me.
There's things you shouldn't do
Should the eyes of a perfect stranger
Take you down to a new sensation
Don't wait till it's gone
Don't go where you don't belong
In a world of pain and sorrow
Every wish is your command
Should always find a home.
I know the signs and I'm telling you.
Like I'm making you mine.
I would die by your side my love
I'm the life that you save.
In this world of pain and sorrow
A heart like yours should never live alone.
I used to dream of a special one
Stop before we go too far
You got your pretty face and you got any name you wore
That's where I belong.
You're in trouble if you
That's where I belong.
You're in trouble if you
So many tell you that you can't win
It's a battle if you're lonely
Or if you're starting over
And you know there's something more
And the city kicks it out of you and...
That's where I belong.
You're in trouble if you
Knowing I was in above my head.
There'll be nights of love and yes there will be tears.
You're crossing the water
And she came in the night.
Well she came for the moment
And stayed till the end wee ah.
I was lonely in western days
I was down in the rising sun
You're crossing the water
I'm not that someone who's got what you want
I can do nothing but watch what you do
You just want someone to kiss you good night
But lips are never enough to get you through
You stole my nights and you got your way
Ebony don't walk out on me
Pick up the pieces of my life into the night of day
How do you break this heart of steel
Open the pages of my life
I'm only flesh and blood
I'll be your Savior but baby I swear
I'm not living my life over you
Some satisfaction you get if you dare
But is it ever enough to get you through
You stole my mind and you watch me fall
Ebony don't walk out on me
I never thought you could
I'm only what you make of me
I'm only flesh and blood
I'm only flesh and blood
A broken man with something to hide
You learn how to cry. You learn how to cry
Ebony don't walk out on me
Pick up the pieces of my life into the night of day
How do you break this heart of steel
Open the pages of my life
I'm only flesh and blood
Gone are the days that came and went
Houses are made of wood
Live in a world of sand and stone
I'm only flesh and blood
Ebony don't walk out on me
I never thought you could
I'm only what you make of me
You're living your life
In somebody else's heart
As oceans are far apart.
I lost everything in losing you.
Drying these tears I cry
And I wish you were here
I tried to throw our love away
In somebody else's dream
I've yet to decide who's real.
The blood red rose will never never die
It'll burn like a flame
In the dark of the night
If you hear me there.
Drying these tears I cry
It's that time of year
But you're dealing with a heart of stone
Try to kiss and say goodbye
Try to throw our love away
And that storm will blow.
Try to kiss and say goodbye
Try to throw our love away
Something good in giving in
You must be made of stone.
Just when I was safe and sound
Love you built a wall around
You take a hard line attitude
Time to send me back to school
Easy on your body when you got no name.
Show me the way inside.
You can knock on any door
I know what I'm looking for
Time to turn the engine on
Pretty girl lives all alone
Hot as hell and cold as ice
Everything I sacrifice
I got to pick up on what you do
I just can't get over you
Easy on your body when you got no name.
Show me the way inside.
I nearly gave myself away.
Easy on your body when you got no name.
Show me the way inside.
Easy on the body when you've got no name
Hold me like you know me
Show me the way inside
Hold me like you know me
Show me the way inside
Hold me like you know me
Find a way of making sure.
Are you the killer or the cure.
I could be the fire you start
At just the mention of your name.
And let you shoot me down in flames
Who crawl home to you.
Tell me will you ever let me in.
Maybe the trick is to be
The way to make you make that
The dream is real for those who dare.
I will redefine your life
We remember till we die
When love is in motion who needs
And soon we know what passion is
All is fair in love and war
Who crawl home to you.
Tell me will you ever let me in.
I will be the fire you start
At just the mention of your name.
Who crawl home to you.
Tell me will you ever let me in.
Tell me will you ever let me in
Lovers in ancient times
Something deep inside you
Something deep inside you
I place my fingers to your lips and I tell you my love flies with you
You'll never be alone
Something deep inside you
Something deep inside you
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
I used to smile and say hello. Guess I was just a happy guy.
I just can't move myself. I guess it all just had to be.
Mine eyes can only look at you... you.
I watched the falling rain and listened to the sweet birds sing.
Mine eyes can only look at you... you.
Every single word you hear... is coming from this heart of mine.
I never felt like this before... a love like yours so young and fine.
And now as I try to forget you... it doesn't work out any way.
I loved you such a long time ago... but in my eyes you'll always be.
I loved you such a long time ago... don't know why...
And I don't know why... baby...
Mine eyes can only look at you... you.
That never shone on me
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
In my brain I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
It's something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Ooh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
Can't think what I've just said
Put the soft pillow on my head
Millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
Yet millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
It's something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own.
Gotta do the things I wanna do.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
They brought me back to see my way with you.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen.
Barker sing me a song
There must be something there
There must be something there
Barker sing me a song
Never before have I seen the like
Barker sing me a song
And of course it rains everyday.
And of course it rains everyday.
I'd remember all of the times I've gone wrong.
And of course it rains everyday.
Laughing at people with stars in their eyes
Talking with the lambs who came out of the sky
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
Laughing at people with stars in their eyes
Talking with the lambs who came out of the sky
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You should be here standing so near to me.
But give me time alone to get it out of my mind.
Though say I know it's only the weather.
And the sun will shine if just for you.
Trains walk by and the birds disappear.
But why am I still here without you by my side.
And the rain will fall.
And the clouds will break
And the sun will shine
Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
Cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory
Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
To take your heart away
Watching them sail and the sun as sinks in the sea.
Only the eyes of the doomed with a smile on their face.
Take a look inside myself.
Windows that slide up and down with a squeak in the sound.
Tomorrow you can climb a mountain
Sail a sailboat through a fountain
Play no games he'd say to me when the light is gone
So please don't make no hesitation
There will be no recreation
And it's shattering to hear you mustn't listen with your ear
He'd sing his song most every night
Wishing she was there behind the light
The people danced and sang along
On the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong
And the piper played the tune
And the drummer wore his spurs
But the song that the singer sang was for her
Now the singer's song is never heard
And the visions he once saw are disappeared
Now they never dance or sing along
But on the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong
And the piper played the tune
And the drummer wore his spurs
But the song that the singer sang was for her
The preacher talked to me and he smiled
Now for once in your life you're alone
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I told him I'm in no hurry
And for once in my life I'm alone
And I've got to let her know just in time before I go
I've just go to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I've just got to get a message to her
One more hour and my life will be through
Which started the whole world crying
That the joke was on me
Which started the whole world laughing
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Which started the whole world living
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Which started the whole world living
That the joke was on me
We used to love while others used to play
Some one else moved in from far away
And you don't ask the time of day
But guess we'll cry come first of May
The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine
And you don't ask the time of day
But guess we'll cry come first of May
Do do do do do do do do do...
She knows that life is a running race
Her face shouldn't show any signs
You can be beautiful too
You can be beautiful too
She knows that life is a running race
Her face shouldn't show any lines
You can be beautiful too
Tomorrow... every one gonna know me better.
And tomorrow... every one gonna drink my wine.
Tomorrow... every one gonna know me better.
And tomorrow... every one gonna drink my wine.
And tomorrow... every one gonna know me better.
And tomorrow... every one gonna drink my wine.
When all my troubles just surround me
And all my problems seem to ground me
Sun in my morning and my sky above
Sun in my morning and my sky above
I work and do the best that I can
Sun in my morning and my sky above
Sun in my morning and my sky above
I've got my women there to guide me
She's my sun in the morning and my sky above
Oh my heart won't believe that you have left me
I keep telling my self that it's true
I can get over anything you want my love
But I can't get myself over you
Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
Don't forget to remember me my love
On my wall lies a photograph of you girl
Though I try to forget you somehow
You're the mirror of my soul so take me out of my hole
Let me try to go on living right now
Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
I'd want I'd never need.
If I could get the nerve to plant the seed.
I see her face in myself.
If only had my mind on something else.
Captain of the submarine beneath the icebergs never seen.
I keep on pushing never stop.
If I could just forget her name.
I see her face in myself.
If only had my mind on something else.
You know I love getting up in the morning
When the sun first strikes the trees
All the morning birds that sing above
Still bring back memories
Of a girl who stood beside me
When the rights I did were wrong
But she went back down the river
Just when I thought I could be strong
She never told me why she left me
But the letter said goodbye
And my nights to reason why
Why a stranger comes to steal the love
Of a girl I had to hold
But she went back down the river
Just when I thought I could be strong
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
I see you every morning
Outside the restaurants
The music plays so nonchalant
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
You will see me at the time I love the best
In the daytime I will meet you as before.
Building castles in the shifting sands
In the morning of my life the
Minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day
To the top right hand corner of
The ceiling in my room
It is the morning of my life
It is the morning of my life
I can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrow
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
The first time I met you I knew you were the devil's daughter
And that would only bring me down
I am the searcher of my fortunes
I've got my right hand on the wheel
We've got to dig for buried treasures
I know exactly how I feel
Don't wanna live inside myself
I'm much better off alone
Don't wanna live inside myself
Where the darkness is my friend
I heard all about the beginning
I wanna see just where it ends
Don't wanna live inside myself
I'm much better off alone
Don't wanna live inside myself
I have fed the jaded tiger
And every tiger knows my name
I can tell myself my name
Don't wanna live inside myself
I'm much better off alone
Don't shed a tear for me
If you're not here by me
Then it's not worth while
My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine
What do I do to have you stay
My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine
Don't shed a tear for me
That's not your style
If you're not here by me
I got myself a coach ticket on the Southern railroad line
You walked out the door and the only thing I saw was the hall light
I got myself a coach ticket on the Southern railroad line
Why didn't you see that you don't feel the same way as I do
I understood before that you couldn't take much more as I knew
I got myself a coach ticket on the Southern railroad line
If ever you've got rain in your heart
Someone has hurt you and torn you apart
To open up your eyes to love me
And let it be like they said it would be
To open up your eyes to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder
And when you're out in the cold
No one beside you and no one to hold
To open up your eyes to love me
And when you've got nothing to lose
Nothing to pay for and nothing to choose
To open up your eyes to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Run to me whenever you're lonely
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Run to me whenever you're lonely
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Maybe I talk too slow.
But you've got to live a little bit faster
I ain't lost and I ain't searching.
But then you know me very well.
And I can't change the wind and make it blow the other way.
I'm a fool and I can tell.
That I'm alive and that's all.
That I can get up just as fast as I fall.
And I can walk and run but I'll never crawl.
And in the end it doesn't matter at all.
I don't know about the people that I read about in books.
And the Kings and Queens around my room with their quiet dirty looks.
I ain't lost and I ain't searching.
But then you know me very well.
And I can't change the world and make it go the other way.
I'm a fool and I can tell.
That I'm alive and that's all.
That I can get up just as fast as I fall.
And I can walk and run but I'll never crawl.
And in the end it doesn't matter at all.
I don't know about those people that I read about in books.
And the Kings and Queens around my room with their quiet dirty looks.
There's a reason for believing that I've never been alive.
I know I should be going somewhere I just can't arrive.
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I'm locked up I want to be free
Out in the courtyard and over the wall then
My friends are waiting for me
Sixteen people are waiting to get me
Hoping to take me outside
I went along for the ride
Wind in my face and my bones they are aching
My soul must weather the storm
I must run till my back it is breaking
Sixteen people are waiting to get me
Hoping to take me outside
I went along for the ride
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I went along for the ride
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
Maybe there's a reason why we broke up
I could dedicate my life to something new
But I must have been asleep but then I woke up
Working out why I was still with you
All the things I wish I could have been
And I would be respected
I would get a reputation
Midnight stars are shining on my shoeshine
Telling me the things I'm gonna be
And the world is gonna fall in love with me
All the things I wish I could have been
And I would be respected
I would get a reputation
All that I need is just a piece of paper
All that I need is just a quiet corner
The times I've tried to hide it
That's what I've decided on
Would it change you for the better
It better be all right
To be always like children
To make up for all the things that I would lose
Would it change you for the better
It better be all right
To be always like children
If I give up my life for my King and country men
Would it change you for the better
It better be all right
To be never like people
I still remember all of those little things.
With my heart and it won't sing.
Yes. I'm dying and there ain't no doubt.
Well I try try try try try
When I walk in the rain you won't know that I'm crying.
A smile on my face and I'm trying.
I'm trying to understand that a love that is lost can never be found again.
You know he knew you more then me.
I went home laughing and inside I'm crying.
We had a special thing.
With my heart and it won't sing.
You know my heart just won't sing.
Well I try try try try try.
When I walk in the rain you won't know that I'm crying.
A smile on my face and I'm trying.
I'm trying to understand that a love that is lost can never be found again.
Still I try try try try try.
Well I try try try try try
Still I try try try try try.
Well I try try try try try
Would that be hard for you to try and understand
I've been waiting for this day for so so long
It doesn't matter much to me
Don't you ask me why I'm here
Do you remember all the nights
And all the love we went through
Well you know maybe I thought you had some left over
Could I mean that much to you
It doesn't matter much to me
Don't you ask me why I'm here
Now open up your arms and take me
Make me love you till I die
You wouldn't have me when I was a young man
But tonight I'm gonna try
It doesn't matter much to me
Don't you ask me why I'm here
Some nights we made our love in the sand
And at the dark we held our love hand in hand
And we listened to music the ocean was playing
The words that our two hearts were saying
That only two lovers can make
Let us ride on the wind while this moment is real
Your the light of my life
You are welcome to my Charade
And this feeling knowing you blessed me forever
And believing I have been touch by your love
And the pleasure of knowing the evening won't tare us apart
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone
We can gaze up the sky till the night is over
You are welcome to my Charade
And this feeling knowing you blessed me forever
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone
We can gaze at the sky till the night is over
You are welcome to my Charade
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone
We can gaze at the sky till the night is over
You're really no good
Just what you mean to me
You're gonna take away my energy
Still gets in my eyes
There you go with your fancy lies
You just ain't no good
And if there's somebody
Still gets in my eyes
Nobody believe what you say
And if there's somebody
In a room full of strangers
Where your eyes couldn't see me
Though you did not want me to
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them love songs
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them sweet sounds
There are so many others
How long will they stand between us
Though you did not want me to
Singing them love songs
Singing them sweet sounds
Even if it takes forever
Even if it takes a lifetime
Somehow I feel inside
Make it like it was before
Even if it takes a lifetime
Seems like you don't want
The love of this man at all
And it's sure been a lonely time
Right up to the time I met you
So if you take a love like mine
You know how easy it is to hurt me
And my love won't desert me
So you say to yourself
Do you think I'm gonna stand here
And it's the start of a love affair
The moment when I first met you
You know how easy it is to break me
And my love won't forsake me
You'll always love me forever
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
And my love won't forsake me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
And my love won't forsake me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
And my love won't desert me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
And my love won't forsake me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
She's juicy and she's trouble
She gets it to me good
My woman give me power
Goes right down to my blood
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
She came on like the night and she held on tight
And the world was right when she made love to me
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up
I was here and she was gone
Maybe you can tell me
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong
Where did she go when I need her close to me
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart
I could take it in my stride
Start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size
When you move it like you really know how to move me
I follow you wherever you go
Come on boogie child let your love light shine
At the edge of the universe.
And I know it'll make her worse.
Now I look out on forever
And it must be nice down there.
But I'm only three feet wide.
And I live inside an ocean that flows
And it looks like it's gonna be a lovely afternoon.
It's been my longest journey
And I've come through the black of night.
I was tired and hungry
When I saw your distant light.
But I'm sure I got here first.
At the edge of the universe.
At the edge of the universe.
And I know it'll make her worse.
Now I look out on forever
And it must be nice down there.
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
You know the door to my very soul
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Well now I get low and I get high
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'll live to see another day
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you can look the other way
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
There is movement all around
On the waves of the air
If it's something we can share
And that sweet city woman
She move through the light
We know how to show it
We know how to show it
In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
I got fire in my mind
And I'm glowing in the dark
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
We know how to show it
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you
Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love I know I would die
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
And it just don't matter how I cry
My tears of love are a waste of time
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
And it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily
To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
Maybe I don't wanna know the reason why
But lately you don't talk to me
Darling I can't see me in your eyes
I hold you near but you're so far away
And it's losing you I can't believe
To watch you leave and let this feeling die
You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
And tomorrow if I'm here without your love
You know I can't survive
Only my love can raise you high above it all
We can take the darkness and make if full of light
But let your love flow back to me
How can you leave and let this feeling die
This happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone
And I won't even have your shoulders for the crying on
We changed the world we made it ours to hold
But dreams are made for those who really try
This losing you is real
But I still feel you here inside
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more
I can see beyond forever
Everything we own will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night or day
And the tears we had to cry
I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we own will never die
When you are to me the light above
Made for all to see our precious love
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Love is such a beautiful thing
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Here I lie in a lost and lonely part of town
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and you don't know why
Night and day there's a burning down inside of me
Burning love with a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go and I just can't take it all alone
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
Your kisses taste like honey
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Too many heartaches in one lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Don't try to tell me it's all over
No man could love you more
You can't change the way I feel inside
You are the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
No man on earth can stand between my love and I
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I was stood by the light as I looked through the window
With the greatest intention not meaning to see
I was there in the dark and I saw you together
Get the cards on the table
You've got to be cruel to be kind
He's a liar and I should know liar
There was smoke in the air and sweet smell of leather
I was through the window and down in the street
And it's not how I want it to be
There's a hand on my shoulder
Was it not for the man that was blocking the drive
Was it not for the red limousine
I'd be millions of miles from th scene of the crime
And I should know liar
The woman in you brings out
It's the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy
But baby sharper than a knife
Show me the night to satisfy
A sinner with the flash of an eye
There'll never be another me
I never knew love could wind me up
And maybe old enough to try
I never knew anyone in between
The devil and the angel
All in one and maybe old
Enough that I can ride
Your love let me burn
Let me slide down to your soul
But your baby needs love
The woman in you brings out
It's the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy
In the fire out of the night
I'll teach you how to tremble
If you give me the night
I never knew I could find the best
Is no doubt and maybe we can
I never knew we could find
A way this crazy situation
Over me and we forget about
You can throw me down
But your baby needs love
The woman in you brings out
It's the woman in you
Lonely in the black of night
There can be no love for me now
Nobody listens when the words ain't right
And you get into someone else
It's hard for me to know
What did I do it all for
There's no one I could love more
I did it for your heart alone
I can be strong if you're there
And there is someone belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to me
I live in a world where the face of an angel is all that a fool can see
You got the power to find me whenever I'm lost
Can eat away a heart of stone
And baby if I leave you too late
It's just a feather and the bird has flown
It's colder when the fire dies
With all the trouble I'm in if I lose you too
If I don't wanna go through
Couldn't be life at all
We didn't make it by chance
And there is someone belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to me
I'm caught in a world on the edge of tomorrow
It's all that a fool can find
I don't belong in the arms of a love that is lost
There must be something we can say my love
Something except goodbye
If I don't wanna go through
Couldn't be life at all
We didn't make it by chance
And there is someone belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to me
And there is someone belonging to someone
You give me the runaround
I communicate with you
Tell me what it means to feel
What am I supposed to do
Nothing any words can say
Nothing that we know is real
It'll take you higher and higher and higher
Suddenly the soul is burning
You give me the runaround
Just another night with you
I communicate with you
Tell me what it means to feel
What am I supposed to do
Nothing any words can say
Nothing that we know is real
And it'll take you higher and higher and higher
You give me the runaround
Just another night with you
What am I supposed to do
Nothing that we know is real
Couldn't figure why you couldn't give me what everybody needs
Find out everybody knows that you've been using me
I'm surprised you let me stay around you
One day I'm gonna lift the cover and look inside your heart
We've got a little bit before we go and tear this love apart
This battle of love with me
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
I'm gonna hit you from all sides
Lay your fortress open wide
Nobody stops this body from taking you
I'm gonna be there one day when you fall
I could never let you cast aside
The greatest love of all
This battle of love with me
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
There'll be one small light
All over the world tonight.
It will love with no name
And we glowed in the sun.
There was one small dream
Ordinary people living ordinary lives.
Ordinary people living ordinary lives.
Living ordinary lives
What else could we do
What else could we do
Just as my life fades to darkness
You you make me see the light.
Show me that my search is over
Someone can love so completely
One kiss should break the seal.
Truth can be stranger than fiction
You'll be my only possession
I'll be a slave to you
We hold the power together
And every breath you take is planned
I steal the night away
I was just one of the guys
And I thought I had it made
I needed someone to show me how to love
The night was magic when we first met
You know you taught me to fly
You take me clear to the sky
And all the people around the world can stand aside
I was an average guy in a world of empty dreams
You've broken down all the walls with your love
You know you taught me to fly
You take me clear to the sky
And all the people around the world can stand aside
It keeps going strong throughout eternity
You know you taught me to fly
You take me clear to the sky
And all the people around the world can stand aside
That never shone on me
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
In my brain I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
It's something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Ooh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
Can't think what I've just said
Put the soft pillow on my head
Millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
Yet millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
It's something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
And where are the friends
The girl that I loved
They run for their lives
How can you lead them to heaven
Children of the night
That which we say is forever
Not too young to be old
Reach out for each other when
Feel so good to be home
Everything for us to see
You fight for your rights
How can you live for the hour
When there's no yesterday
Your number your name
All that which keeps us together
Is bringing us the pain
Comes the criminal mind
Working for the power of
There's no one in Avalon to show you
Minutes into seconds are you ready
And there are two of us
Sleep pretty baby while you wait so long
Together we can take away
The time and the space
Baby when you got a secret love
Every little touch is not enough
Every little moment we're apart is pain to me
Maybe we can find some hideaway
Everybody knows but who can say
Secretly you know I'd follow
Anywhere to make you happy
Anyway you want me I'll be standing by
I don't wanna lose the one I hunger for
Everything to lose and no alibi
Baby when you got a secret love
Secretly you know I'd follow
Anywhere to make you happy
And there are two of us
Baby when you got a secret love
Secretly you know I'd follow
But his love is just a game
And no closer to the fire
And you don't hear me when I cry
You may need someone to lean upon
And what is left is a love so strong
You wouldn't believe to what extent
You wouldn't deny me in your dreams
You couldn't belong to someone else
If you could see me now
And I'd be the only one
My understanding that you remember
I swear to you I pray
That you feel the battle rage
For the saving of my soul
And it's a struggle to survive
And baby I don't wanna die
I will be someone you lean upon
And what is left is a love so strong
You wouldn't believe to what extent
You wouldn't deny me in your dreams
You couldn't belong to someone else
If you could see me now
And I'd be the only one
I will be someone you lean upon
And what is left is a love so strong
I will be someone you lean upon
Don't tell me it's too late
And your love don't make me wait
I can see the end of time
With a love that makes you mine
And tonight I let you know
Though I know it's time to take you home
Baby you and I are all alone
We should take a moment of our own
And look what we've got
You could destroy this heart of mine
I'm only trying to get by
Hiding in the shadows of the night
Holding you and knowing the wrong is right
I shield you from the rain
I've been slow to get you but
And whether you believe I'm in love with you
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean
Is it only a dream to a teenage queen
And all the years of tears and laughter
Will it be happy ever after
Heaven is a place inside of me
Only you can change the way I feel
And make it feel good
Where there is love there is no crime
Let me be the one to dry your eyes
We can be the promise that never dies
Blinded by the vision
Any less than an hour
And whether you believe I'm in love with you
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean
Is it only a dream to a teenage queen
And all the years of tears and laughter
Will it be happy ever after
And whether you believe I'm in love with you
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean
Is it only a dream to a teenage queen
And you define the dream you're after
Will it be happy ever after
Will it be happy ever after
I'm here to bend your will
I give you love you've never known
You can wish for something bad
All she wants is your love
All she wants is your love
We're the party with no name
And we go from flame to flame
We've got one claim to fame
We're the party with no name
Make those footsteps to the floor
You can't see us anymore
Ain't no time for the shame
For the party with no name
A soul without a space
Her life is just a mystery
I'd give her more than I could give
I'd even die that she could live
All she wants is your love
All she wants is your love
We're the party with no name
And we go from flame to flame
We've got one claim to fame
We're the party with no name
All she wants is your love
All she wants is your love
We're the party with no name
And we go from flame to flame
We've got one claim to fame
Take me to your world of wonder
Let me come inside your room
Some investigation as to the state of us
No misunderstanding girl
I couldn't lie if I try any other way
I can't stop thinking of that girl of mine
I'm for the rise and the fall
Ride on my ghost train
Ride on my ghost train
Who can stop your past from rushing by
Born to live one million stories high
Take me to a town or country
Stranger in a strange land
You be there at the station
When the train arrives
When it leaves I get my hands on you
I fool myself if I turn any other way
I'm for the hell of it all
Ride on my ghost train
Hearts can break and hearts can
All is love and love is open wide
She give me trouble enough
And she's a ball of light
I'm in the tunnel of love
With the American dream
And I was born too soon
She got me climbing the walls
Got me hard as a rock
And I'd be the one to know
When am I gonna go to your dimension
When am I gonna go to where you are
When am I gonna go to your dimension
And she's a way of life
And whether dead or alive
In every muscle and bone
She was a love machine
And she could wrestle me down
And get a taste of me
How can the body know
When am I gonna go to your dimension
When am I gonna go to where you are
When am I gonna go to your dimension
I believed I could die over you
Break down and never see me through
Through my darkest night
One prayer within me burning
And there's no price on what you hold
And it keeps moving on
You know I will be waiting to be
You'll never feel the pain
How can you say to me
That I should go on living
I left the only life I had with you
No use in me pretending to be
And you the heart of me
How can you say to me
That I should go on living
I left the only life I had with you
Just your way and my way
And I can stand how you cried to be free
High as the wind blows
But not enough to bring you home to me
And only lonely knows
You know my flame is burning
But I'm too blind to see the end has begun
No use in me pretending to be
And you the heart of me
How can you say to me
That I should go on living
I left the only life I had with you
One love that will not die
I may sorry that I built my
There will be others who would
Leave you as I found you
One love that will not die
I may sorry that I built my
There will be others who would
Knowing what I came here for
If I can pinpoint this feeling
When you gonna let it grow
We can draw the line on where we
Never wanna lose control
Making me the subject
Of your warm initiation
If I can pinpoint this feeling
When you gonna let it show
You make me nervous but it's now or never
You can be my message from above
And it's time to say you're sorry
We can sanctify our love
And you and I we're written in the wind
I want to be your human sacrifice
I want to be your lover
I want to be your human sacrifice
I want to be your lover
Gotta be a kill or cure
Maybe undergo a lover's operation
Nothing cuts like a knife can
You don't wanna hurt me more
Look at all that damage
You can wear me closer to the bone
It don't work to make me worry
But the demon seed is sown
And you and I we're written in the sky
You can't make me hold on
Better you shoot my love between the eyes
Your eyes on me on this table where I lie
And what I see as fact is fiction
And I'm bound to be abused
I won't let you cut me loose
This love is out to get you
I'm not the one in search of friction
I'm not the one to look for fights
When it gets down to me and you
I think it over twice
We sing the same song
With it all subject to change
You and I will meet again
I saw the signs I never knew
Didn't have enough on you to follow through
Call it innocent or guilty
Whose heart you gonna break
If I believe your true confessions
I'm never gonna make it
You know you hurt me for the very last time
And if someone comes between us
It's the death of my heart
I think about you and I paint a picture
You wanna love above the law
And you got a taste for adventure
We're the victims of the same sensations
I can be as bad as you
I won't stand in the way but I will if I can
Not to be your judge and jury
It's still you inside me
Whose heart you gonna break
If I believe your true confessions
I'm never gonna make it
You know you hurt me for the very last time
And if someone comes between us
It's the death of my heart
My gun is loaded and I'm ready for war
I come and get you and I kick down the door
I'm not working for the enemy
Whose heart you gonna break
If I believe your true confessions
I'm never gonna make it
You know you hurt me for the very last time
And if someone comes between us
There's a law in what we do
We got a quest for something new
Everything you witness seems to
If someone gets you from behind
And you've been thirsty for the friend you found
Close your eyes and make a wish
I don't wanna mess with mother nature
Knowing that you're mine
You with another and we all get satisfied
It's a form of evolution
An eternal source of pleasure
When your love is for the giving
It's a case of destiny
You know we look for the same insane games
So I get all wound up inside
I can see your scene unwind
You dance together or you dance alone
And leave the real world in the air
Love it in leather I don't care
Everything is legal in the danger zone
Close your eyes and make a wish
Later we could cater to the animal
Knowing that you're mine
It's straight in my face
You and your lover and the brain is paralyzed
It's a form of evolution
It's a cycle of emotion
In the storm of revolution
What is done can be undone
You know we look for the same insane games
To the subtle variations
It's a form of evolution
It's a cycle of emotion
It's a case of destiny
And you can find your source of pleasure
It's a form of evolution
It's a cycle of emotion
It's a case of destiny
And you can find your source of pleasure
How did you find there was somebody
More than you want me
Maybe I have never had you
I have been lonely for you lately
I can't wait another day
And when you let me get you close to me
Paying the price of love
The start of my end over you
Now is all there will ever be
No more to live without you
All the nights I dream about you
Deep in the dark of the night
I'm a man on a mission
But safer with you home
Never would I make you sorry
You are the only drug I crave
And I've been saving everyday
You don't forget you got me
Paying the price of love
My heart in my hands over you
But the battle is just not fair
That emotion is always replaying
You know the strongest heart
Is broken when it falls
You turn and walk away
I got this picture in my head
Of you in someone else's bed
I'm torn apart inside
I'll build my world around you
I was nothing when I found you
Paying the price of love
Paying the price of love
The start of my end over you
When you're doing it for someone
Now is all there will ever be
Paying the price of love
My heart in my hands over you
But the battle is just not fair
Never more aware of what you do
And me believing that you've never done right
When you've never done wrong
It's not the eye alone that gives you sight
I've never given anybody my soul
But I'm coming undone
I'm a survivor but I'm reaching my low
But I'm not ready to die
I'm here for the kiss of life
I'm here for the kiss of life
Just give me the kiss of life
But they're only imitations
So now you're telling me it's just a ring
You say it's nothing but it's everything
I'm under pressure and I'm under
Your gun and I'm fingers and thumbs
You got the questions and the answers
I'm being buried alive
I'm here for the kiss of life
I'm here for the kiss of life
Just give me the kiss of life
Strangers in the dark
To love and never cry
I'm a survivor but I'm reaching my low
But I'm not ready to die
I'm here for the kiss of life
I'm here for the kiss of life
I got a bad sensation
The enemy is all around
The traces of my naked heart
Are laid upon the ground
I suffered side effects
That might have been forever
And I was left alone to pray
When there was no one in the way
Took a trip around the world
Made myself invisible
The taste was in the wine
And just when the thought of someone
I don't believe the words are true
That only she could be my savior
Experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love
She said experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love
And she's all alone with me
And lighting all my days of sorrow
If there was any more to give
You know I'd sacrifice it for her
And in the prime of my life
I was blessed and I was sent
Someone sweet and innocent
And nervous when she kissed
And in the face of my
Forbidden fruit forever
And knowing I'm the first
In her secret universe
There's no sense of space and time
Someone warm and wonderful
That any man would understand
That love is like the wind
Something deep inside to give you
And when the words get in the way
The only thing you need is silence
Experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love
She said experience is not enough
We set the same scene
Circumstances different than they
People in two places can be
Never what you're fighting for
Never makes it easy when you try too hard
I wish you would define what you feel
Hard on or letting go
Stand tall and understand
Everybody needs a plan
There'll be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
We share the same pain
Underneath the covers I will set you free
I will prove to you my love is
Stronger than the night is long
Let it be together if we rise or fall
Or is it just my imagination
Or the light of a precious stone
Everybody needs a plan
There'll be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
Here at the scene of the crime
Laid in your arms I will die
I know it's more than infatuation
That's keeping this man alive
Stand tall and understand
Everybody needs a plan
There'll be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
Everybody needs a plan
There'll be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
But no one sees inside
The spark of baby's eyes and I turn to stone
Maybe I can't survive in the danger zone
Streets without light
Try to hold her to myself
Needs so many games to play
One more time I climb the stairs
Open up the door and she was gone
Like a lamb to slaughter
Don't stop haunting me in this old house
I still love you when you're not around
I'm still waiting for your midnight ride
I'll still love you when it's cold outside
Me so sorry that I let you down
But you keep haunting me in this old town
And the smile is no longer there
The face and the eyes and the hair
Nothing stands the test of time
I cling to dreams that turn to sand
Our life is now a distant land
We commit emotional suicide
Every single room is electrified
Your memory shadowing me
The house where sorrow hides
Help me send these walls of love away
Like a lamb to slaughter
Don't stop haunting me in this old house
I still love you when you're not around
I'm still waiting for your midnight ride
I'll still love you when it's cold outside
Me so sorry that I let you down
I've been lonely so much
Nothing in life is the same
And the sooner we stop to start
And there's a heart like mine
Somewhere in this world
There's a heart like mine
Beating but left to burn
Maybe you can hide your face forever
That when you search for someone
There's a heart like mine
There's a heart like mine
Feel her voice in your ear
Nothing you say could be wrong
And there's a heart like mine
Somewhere in this world
There's a heart like mine
Beating but left to burn
Maybe we can share it all forever
I'm gonna search for someone
There's a heart like mine
There's a heart like mine
And baby are we waking up together
If there is love for someone
And there's a heart like mine
Somewhere in this world
There's a heart like mine
Beating but left to burn
Maybe we can share it all forever
I'm gonna search for someone
There's a heart like mine
There's a heart like mine
There's a heart like mine
When you wait and you watch
And you're wishing for something wild
I figure I can please you someday someway
I figure I can put your love on trial
I'm taking you back to school
Talk about making it something real
Nobody could deny you anything
You know I'd do anything
You know I'd do anything
You know I'd do anything
You know I'd do anything
You can run with the fun
You can tickle my nerves inside
It's gonna be a magic carpet ride
Better we make it soon
Let it be the one that make you
Anyone else would buy you anything
You know I'd do anything
You know I'd do anything
You know I'd do anything
You know I'd do anything
You know I'd do anything
You know I'd do anything
You know I'd do anything
You know I'd do anything
Living in a world that dies within
You are they who try and touch the wind
You could be the blessed one that
And doing what you've never done before
Taking every wave that hits the shore
You could be a silver star that shines
See you on a blue island
Take you to a blue island
You can feel the pain
That no part of me is going through
Do you know the place you're going to
You're going to a blue island
This is what the lonely heart must know
This is what it takes to make it grow
You could be a child alone
But you may save the world
Maybe it's the words that mean goodbye
There but for the grace of God go I
I can see an open door that leads to my blue island
Gonna be a blue island
See you on a blue island
Take you to a blue island
Woman in a million to me
I never loved so much
Is it any wonder I'm alive
No one ever knows what makes a
Let it be the spell I'm under
Let it be the rain and thunder comes
I go above and beyond the sun
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
I'd give it all for you and me
Love is the earth and the wind
And the fire and the soul
Love is above and beyond any eye to behold
Love is the key and the cause
Every little touch I'm paralyzed
No one ever know what makes
Let me be the one to taste you
No pity if the city ever crumbles down
I go above and beyond the sun
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
I'd give it all for you and me
Love is the earth and the wind
And the fire and we share
Love is the force and the edge
And it's ready for those who dare
Love is above and beyond
And I'm taking you there
I go above and beyond the sun
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
I'd give it all for you and me
Love is the earth and the wind
And the fire and the soul
Love is the key and the cause
Love is the force and the edge
And it's yours if you dare
Love is above and beyond
And I'm taking you there
I go above and beyond the sun
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
I stumble in the night
Never really knew what it would've been like
You're no longer there to
The heartache over you
I gave it everything but I couldn't get through
I never saw the signs
You're the last to know when love is blind
All the tears and the turbulent years
When I would not wait for no one
And see me losing you
When the lonely heart breaks
It's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more
And the fire that will roar
There's a hole in my soul
And for me it's to cry
For whom the bell tolls
Seen you in a magazine
Where you shouldn't have been
I'm still in love with you
Won't you come back to your little boy blue
I've come to feel inside
This precious love was never mine
Now I know but a little too late
That I could not live without you
In the dark of the broad daylight
I promise I'll be there
When the lonely heart breaks
It's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more
And the fire that will roar
There's a hole in my soul
And for me it's to cry
For whom the bell tolls
I never knew there'd be times like this
When I couldn't reach out to no one
Am I never gonna find someone
That knows me like you do
Are you leaving me a helpless child
When it took so long to save me
Fight the devil and the deep blue sea
I'll follow you anywhere
I promise I'll be there
When the lonely heart breaks
It's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more
And the fire that will roar
There's a hole in my soul
And for me it's to cry
Fool in the night on the stair
With the light by the window
Out in the jungle of life she was
All of the years I've been there for the tears
Out in the city she search for the face
Did you believe that a love so alive
Fool is the father who clings to the
Mother too weary to question
There with your head in your hand
As you pray to her picture
Out in the rain she would search
Did you believe you could find
What you need with a stranger
Did you believe that a love so alive
Goes right on till the dawn.
My woman keeps me warm.
She's juicy and she's trouble.
She gets it to me good.
Goes right down to my blood.
Goes right on till the dawn.
My woman keeps me warm.
I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I could hear you breathing
With a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
And for the state I'm in
And all the wonders made for the Earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone
Just the beat of a lonely heart
I don't want to be alone
And since you're busy every minute
I make believe you care
I feel you everywhere
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
Am I the subject of the pain
Am I the stranger in the rain
And if there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination
Another story there to be told
And I pray it's not too late
Just a beat of a lonely heart
I don't want to be alone
And all the wonders made for the Earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told
And I pray it's not too late
Just a beat of a lonely heart
I don't want to be alone
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone
Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of sight
The heart that you want just happens to be mine
The face of a friend invisible on the street
And I surrender. take me for all time
No more hide and seek
You are the highest dream to me
And as you softly sleep
Then I can tell you what it means
Locked in my arms like lovers lie
I will not let you slip away
Is this my night of nights
That you came to stay
Just the way that love should be
And there is something I must say to you
If you promise to believe
That it's you I'm living for
Seasons may come and seasons go
But these are the truest words I know
This is the summer of our lives
One love that cannot die
Never let you say goodbye
And there is something I must say to you
We leave the world outside
Let my deepest love inside
I'm only doing what I have to do
If you promise to believe
That it's you I'm living for
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
Reflection will show this connection
We can lean on each other
This is all we need to know
I believe I may be losing you
Under your spell and over my head
We don't need to worry
How can we survive if we change what is real
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
Reflection will show this connection
We can lean on each other
This is all we need to know
I see the angel and the devil in your heart
And where you're leading me
I don't have the will to fight
Out of the darkness and into the light
Please don't make me shiver
I know together we deliver
Let the gods decide who finds the sweetest thrill
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection
This is all we need to know
Don't let him get too close to you
You've got a stranger on your mind
I know I'm only human if I cry
Or maybe we should kiss and say goodbye
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection
This is all we need to know
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
Reflection will show this connection
We can lean on each other
When the power of love comes together
There is nothing can tear us apart
And the touch of your hand I can feel
That what we got is stronger than steel
It's my own silent message to you
And my soul is divided in two
With my love on the line
I send it all over the world
And my heart has a mind of it's own
It's my lover's prayer
A place blessed by us
And the moment of truth is forever
In the face of incredible odds
And the look in your eyes tells me why
Let our words burn a sign in the sky
It's as easy as talking to you
In my own private vision come true
You're heaven on earth
You're the fire and all that I'm worth
Don't say it's over for me
It's as easy as talking to you
In my own private vision come true
In my search for your love
I send it all over the world
And the nights get long
But my heart holds on
It's my own silent message to you
And my soul is divided in two
And my heart has a mind of it's own
Say you never send me away
What cannot be changed
No one ever takes your place
Gotta let the pantomime
I bring you into me there's be no separation
I will climb inside your world
Must revolve around this girl
And I can see you with my eyes closed
I can feel you when you're near me
Just the knowing that you
You could measure my love
I can touch you with my hands tied
It don't take no extra feeling
You can measure my love
They can stop these tears you cry
And we can ride this storm together
And all the love that lasts forever
Cling to the vine and the vine never breaks
It's a message from a ship to store
For the soul and the sacrifice
We could be victims of a lethal combination
And one of us holds the power
There to forge our hearts together
In the name of love and life
Turn your face to the lonely night
But you're not alone when she calls you home
And this your world is on the edge
As good as lost but you know the way
Through this faceless town
And she pulls me down
Irresistible force meets an immovable object
And human animal madness and blood starts to flow
Invisible fingers and indescribable pleasure
I got to find my personal god
I got to find my personal god
Ring of fire in the days of old
It's what I'm living for
And love's the only law
Irresistible force meets an immovable object
And human animal magic
The rolling of thunder and
You decide what you're after
I get to find my personal god
I get to find my personal god
You must spread your wings and fly
When an irresistible force meets an immovable object
Human animal madness and blood starts to flow
There's bound to be heartbreak
You make it the hard way
She'll read your mind
She's smart as a whip
But look at how much I drip
At the point of ecstasy
Let no one take her place
To confide in someone
And look at how much I paid
I want you next to me
We drifted into vision
And look at how much we see
I just wanna get closer than close to you
To the moment you discover
What the best of my love can do
And lovers fall for lover's friends
We make each other cry
Living in each others lives
It tells you what you want
And look at how close I've come
There's more for us to see
We both end up in heaven
And look at how close we'd be
I just wanna get closer than close to you
I know that one way or the other
Any test of my faith will do
I give my heart for you to break
I give my final breath
When nothing last forever see
We can turn eternity into
Is this your voice I heard
Each letter that I write
But I just can't live and learn
I could live without you
But you don't show the way
No you don't show the way
He may change your world and someday
He may break your heart
And you deserve no better
If you love him I will step aside
So leave me as I love you still
And if he don't keep you warm
So this is who you are
And the rest of my life
And I know that love can't wait
There's a moon and a sun
And a dream that sees me through
A little bit of change and
A little bit of my desire
I didn't know what to say
I'm the man in the middle and
The middle man catches fire
But I don't know how to go away
No I don't know how to go away
He became your hero somehow
And you deserve no better but my love
Is here and all I found
So leave me as I love you still
And if he don't take your heart
You say there's no doubt about it
You got somebody else
When I want you to myself
I can't say no more about it
But my love will go on
Just as long as the river flows
He will be your king and someday
Follow to the letter that my love is
Real and what I found
So leave me as I love you still
And if he don't keep you warm
It happened in the middle of the night
When I thought I had control
Didn't want to be the one to fight
Didn't want to lose my soul
I was up for something more
Never thought I'd get it started
I'm in love with the child inside
I don't have a right to follow you
Or have a license to get closer
A love that won't be denied
For you are something like I've never seen
I'm a man whose heart is crying
Just another one of my obsessions
You don't want to be a special toy
I never be the one to hurt you
Like every other girl and boy
Another game that you want to try
You can never be unfaithful
If you gotta love somebody
Want to make your mountains high
Want to take your valley low
There's a moral to my story
Let me in a close the door
Until the morning light
What I'd give to live inside you
Whisper and I'll be there
I don't want you begging me to stop
I just want to drown in your desire
Love is for those who dare
All the cream is rising to the top
And it's the love you save from dying
Just another one of my obsessions
You don't want to be a special toy
I never be the one to hurt you
Like every other girl and boy
Another game that you want to try
You can never be unfaithful
If you gotta love somebody
Just another one of my obsessions
Something I could never find
It's the kind of love that makes your heart
Feel obsessed with mine
Any battle for the one possession
Another game that you want to try
You can never be unfaithful
If you gotta love somebody
Just another one of my obsessions
You don't want to be a special toy
I never be the one to hurt you
Like every other girl and boy
Another game that you want to try
You can never be unfaithful
If you gotta love somebody
Just another one of my obsessions
Something I could never find
It's the kind of love that makes your heart
Feel obsessed with mine
Any battle for the one possession
Another game that you want to try
You can never be unfaithful
If you gotta love somebody
Just another one of my obsessions
You don't want to be a special toy
I never be the one to hurt you
Like every other girl and boy
Another game that you want to try
You can never be unfaithful
And all the bad is blown away
It's the writing on the wall that makes you see
And what I say that must be heard
With love in every word
Don't get lost in the falling snow
Always out of place alone
With someone you're not sure of
It's a storm but you still survive
So I go around believing you
Nobody knows how much
I pray for you at night
And miracles happen...
There was nothing in my life worth living for
You were there when I was born
The very strength to carry on
Don't get caught in the midnight rain
Part of me believes in you
You're someone I'm not sure of
Like the wind in the cold night air
And through it all we rise and fall
Tear it apart and stay forever
I know where heaven is
Two hearts make it right
And all that love can change
I'll be lost in the falling snow
Always out of place alone
With someone I'm not sure of
Like the wind in the cold night air
And through it all we rise and fall
I know where heaven is
Don't get caught in the midnight rain
Part of me believes in you
You're someone I'm not sure of
Like the wind in the cold night air
I followed like a blind man
To heed the words my father said
The echoes of my childhood and where the path is winding
I stand by you always
And all the tangled webs we weave
You swear it as you live and breathe
Winner takes the prize
No more nights with no end
And nothing from nothing
And ashes to ashes they say
All the more that you reach out
The more that it runs away
I stand my you always
No more nights with no end
If you're lonely in the black of night
I was falling and you helped me get it right
And I pray for the sign
And I won't be too late
If you just come down
I can look you in the eye
I can tell you that I love you
And my love will never die
And it's time that you know
Just how far I mean to go
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
And I wake up by your side
And I lay down my life
If you just take time
And be sure of who you are
We can take it up to heaven
We can walk amongst the stars
And I know if you stay
I will never turn away
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
And I pray for the sign
And I won't be too late
If you just take time
And be sure of who you are
We can take it up to heaven
We can walk amongst the stars
And I know if you stay
I will never turn away
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
You say you saw the dark side
It Gets you through the night
And love is like a red rose baby and so
It's coming around again
If we can take the same direction we'll find
The road that never ends
It goes on forever love never dies
Love never dies it goes on forever
This is the love you've been talking about
You led her in till she couldn't get out
You made the little girl cry
No sad stories to deny
I go through holy war for you baby you know
You say you ain't got a prayer
I'll answer if you call for me
I only wanna live in the shadow you make
But love never dies it goes on forever
You better run to the heart of the flame
She don't change like the sun in the rain
She don't understand why
You made the little girl cry
Love never dies it goes on forever
This is the love you've been talking about
You led her in till she couldn't get out
You made the little girl cry
No sad stories to deny
You better run to the heart of the flame
She don't change like the sun in the rain
She don't understand why
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
She's juicy and she's trouble
She gets it to me good
My woman give me power
Goes right down to my blood
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I could hear you breathing
With a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
And for the state I'm in
And all the wonders made for the Earth
And all the hearts in all creation

Just the beat of a lonely heart
I don't want to be alone
And since you're busy every minute
I make believe you care
I feel you everywhere
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
Am I the subject of the pain
Am I the stranger in the rain
And if there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination
Another story there to be told
And I pray it's not too late
Just a beat of a lonely heart
I don't want to be alone
And all the wonders made for the Earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told
And I pray it's not too late
Just a beat of a lonely heart
I don't want to be alone
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone
Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of sight
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own.
Gotta do the things I wanna do.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
They brought me back to see my way with you.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen.
That never shone on me
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
In my brain I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
Cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory
Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
To take your heart away
She'll read your mind
She's smart as a whip
But look at how much I drip
At the point of ecstasy
Let no one take her place
To confide in someone
And look at how much I paid
I want you next to me
We drifted into vision
And look at how much we see
I just wanna get closer than close to you
To the moment you discover
What the best of my love can do
And lovers fall for lover's friends
We make each other cry
Living in each others lives
It tells you what you want
And look at how close I've come
There's more for us to see
We both end up in heaven
And look at how close we'd be
I just wanna get closer than close to you
I know that one way or the other
Any test of my faith will do
I give my heart for you to break
I give my final breath
When nothing last forever see
We can turn eternity into
Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
Islands in the stream
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
Islands in the stream
Islands in the stream
Reaching for the stars
Maybe I don't wanna know the reason why
But lately you don't talk to me
Darling I can't see me in your eyes
I hold you near but you're so far away
And it's losing you I can't believe
To watch you leave and let this feeling die
You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
And tomorrow if I'm here without your love
You know I can't survive
Only my love can raise you high above it all
We can take the darkness and make if full of light
But let your love flow back to me
How can you leave and let this feeling die
This happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone
And I won't even have your shoulders for the crying on
We changed the world we made it ours to hold
But dreams are made for those who really try
This losing you is real
But I still feel you here inside
There is movement all around
On the waves of the air
If it's something we can share
And that sweet city woman
She move through the light
We know how to show it
We know how to show it
In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
I got fire in my mind
And I'm glowing in the dark
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
We know how to show it
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you
Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love I know I would die
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
I see you every morning
Outside the restaurants
The music plays so nonchalant
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
I used to smile and say hello. Guess I was just a happy guy.
I just can't move myself. I guess it all just had to be.
Mine eyes can only look at you... you.
I watched the falling rain and listened to the sweet birds sing.
Mine eyes can only look at you... you.
Every single word you hear... is coming from this heart of mine.
I never felt like this before... a love like yours so young and fine.
And now as I try to forget you... it doesn't work out any way.
I loved you such a long time ago... but in my eyes you'll always be.
I loved you such a long time ago... don't know why...
And I don't know why... baby...
Mine eyes can only look at you... you.
You should be here standing so near to me.
But give me time alone to get it out of my mind.
Though say I know it's only the weather.
And the sun will shine if just for you.
Trains walk by and the birds disappear.
But why am I still here without you by my side.
And the rain will fall.
And the clouds will break
And the sun will shine
In a room full of strangers
Where your eyes couldn't see me
Though you did not want me to
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them love songs
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them sweet sounds
There are so many others
How long will they stand between us
Though you did not want me to
Singing them love songs
Singing them sweet sounds
Even if it takes forever
Even if it takes a lifetime
Somehow I feel inside
Make it like it was before
Even if it takes a lifetime
I can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrow
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
I've got to to say it and it's hard for me
You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing but you let me down
How can I love you when you ain't around
And I get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you
Only to find that the dream that I follow is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
This is a lesson that I never knew
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
My love is stronger than the universe
You made the rules and you could not see
You made a life out of hurting me
Out of my mind I am held by the power of you love
This is a lesson that I never knew
This is a lesson that I never knew
When I was being what you want me to be
Out on the street anybody you meet
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we never let it end
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
Don't wanna hear your goodbye
Little by little we meet in the middle
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we never let it end
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
Don't wanna hear your goodbye
Don't wanna hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we never let it end
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
Don't wanna hear your goodbye
Don't wanna hear your
And this is all I know
And I must choose to live
For all that I can give
The spark that makes the power grow
But I will stand for one dream if I can
Symbol of my faith in who I am
And I must follow on the road that lies ahead
I won't let my heart control my head
And we don't say goodbye
And I know what I've got to be...
I make my journey through eternity
I keep the memory of you and me
It's there within the child
My storm will never end
My fate is on the wind
I'll make them all remember me
Every ounce of me must see it through
I'm sorry I don't have the role for love to play
Hand over my heart I'll find my way
I will make them give to me...
There is a vision and a fire in me
I keep the memory of you and me
And we don't say goodbye
In all my love for you
And what else we may do
Here I lie in a lost and lonely part of town
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and you don't know why
Night and day there's a burning down inside of me
Burning love with a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go and I just can't take it all alone
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
Which started the whole world crying
That the joke was on me
Which started the whole world laughing
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Which started the whole world living
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Which started the whole world living
That the joke was on me
I saw my problems and I'll see the light
There ain't no danger we can go too far
Grease is the way we are feeling
There is a chance that we can make it so far
Grease is the way we are feeling
There is a chance that we can make it so far
Grease is the way we are feeling
You're really no good
Just what you mean to me
You're gonna take away my energy
Still gets in my eyes
There you go with your fancy lies
You just ain't no good
And if there's somebody
Still gets in my eyes
Nobody believe what you say
And if there's somebody
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
You know the door to my very soul
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Well now I get low and I get high
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'll live to see another day
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you can look the other way
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
She's juicy and she's trouble
She gets it to me good
My woman give me power
Goes right down to my blood
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
The preacher talked to me and he smiled
Now for once in your life you're alone
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I told him I'm in no hurry
And for once in my life I'm alone
And I've got to let her know just in time before I go
I've just go to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I've just got to get a message to her
One more hour and my life will be through
Just as my life fades to darkness
You you make me see the light.
Show me that my search is over
Someone can love so completely
One kiss should break the seal.
Truth can be stranger than fiction
You'll be my only possession
I'll be a slave to you
We hold the power together
And every breath you take is planned
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
Reflection will show this connection
We can lean on each other
This is all we need to know
I believe I may be losing you
Under your spell and over my head
We don't need to worry
How can we survive if we change what is real
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
Reflection will show this connection
We can lean on each other
This is all we need to know
I see the angel and the devil in your heart
And where you're leading me
I don't have the will to fight
Out of the darkness and into the light
Please don't make me shiver
I know together we deliver
Let the gods decide who finds the sweetest thrill
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection
This is all we need to know
Don't let him get too close to you
You've got a stranger on your mind
I know I'm only human if I cry
Or maybe we should kiss and say goodbye
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection
This is all we need to know
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
Reflection will show this connection
We can lean on each other
You will see me at the time I love the best
In the daytime I will meet you as before.
Building castles in the shifting sands
In the morning of my life the
Minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day
To the top right hand corner of
The ceiling in my room
It is the morning of my life
It is the morning of my life
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more
I can see beyond forever
Everything we own will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night or day
And the tears we had to cry
I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we own will never die
When you are to me the light above
Made for all to see our precious love
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Love is such a beautiful thing
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
If ever you've got rain in your heart
Someone has hurt you and torn you apart
To open up your eyes to love me
And let it be like they said it would be
To open up your eyes to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder
And when you're out in the cold
No one beside you and no one to hold
To open up your eyes to love me
And when you've got nothing to lose
Nothing to pay for and nothing to choose
To open up your eyes to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Run to me whenever you're lonely
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Run to me whenever you're lonely
Run to me if you need a shoulder
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again.
People won't believe me but there's truth in what I say.
Many hearts were broken and a lot of tears were shed.
The sky was black and the battlefield was red.
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again.
There's grapeshot all around us and the field is black with lead.
You better start running boy before you lose your head.
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again.
I fixed my bayonet to my gun and really mowed them down.
The three kisses of love.
Tell me that you really care.
I run your fingers through my hair.
The three kisses of love.
Tell me that you really care.
I run your fingers through my hair.
Without you darling I just can't sleep
I'm only happy when we're together
I guess it's time that I told you so
I'll always want to hold you
I wish that you were mine to be forever and ever
Without you darling I just can't sleep
I'm only happy when we're together
I guess it's time that I told you so
I'll always want to hold you
Take hold of that star I give to you
And tell me that you love me
Take hold of that star and put it in your locket
And tell me that you love me
I'd give you the moon or the sun
Take hold of that star and put it in your locket
And tell me that you love me
I'd give you the moon or the sun
Or the starlights with a love so true.
Take hold of that star and put it in your locket
And tell me that you love me
Some may find peace of mind loving a girl like you
You hurt me and you fool around.
You don't even give me a chance.
Well it's over and I'm telling you
It's the end of our romance.
Some may find peace of mind loving a girl like you
You hurt me and you fool around.
You don't even give me a chance.
Well it's over and I'm telling you
It's the end of our romance.
Some may find peace of mind loving a girl like you
And don't believe the jealous lies they told to you
Now don't you know I love you more than I can say
And it would mean my life if you should run away
You just won't listen to my pleas
I'd like to be the one to see your loving mind at the start
I'd like to know how far you'd go to use those lips of wine
You practice to deceive
I've got no room to breathe
You practice to deceive
I've got no room to breathe
Too many boys on your mind
I don't know what I'm doing
Ever since I looked at you.
Ever since I saw you in the moonlight
I'll be waiting for now and forever
For you to come to me.
I'll be waiting for now and forever
For you to come to me.
And to this day when tales are told of pioneers a thousand fold
And to this day when tales are told of pioneers a thousand fold
If this was my love I didn't want to share.
Every day I have to cry.
But if you do it's gonna hurt somebody.
Every day I have to cry.
Every time it's gonna hurt somebody.
Come on and give to me what I have missed
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so
I'm gonna get you or else there will be a big row
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so
Come on and show to me what I have missed
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so
Well I'm telling you now
Wine and women and song will only make me sad.
Cars and buses and trams make a lot of noise.
All my women have gone out with other boys.
Wine and women and song will only make me sad.
I'm so weary from holding this load
And the wind will take me hold before the cold
Each flower I have seen
And the wind will take me home where I can dream
I must be on my way for my home is anywhere
As the wind gently blows in my hair
As the wind gently blows in my hair
All of the women I knew were my friends
I didn't know I was on the way down
I had a billion or two in the bank
You gave me all that a woman could give
All of the women I knew were my friends
Straighten up the mess in my mind about this place
I can't contain myself anymore
Can't you see it's written all over my face
Why don't you get on your feet
It's about time you got to think
What ever happened to peace
The world and it's corruption and moral decay
Why you're so clean through and through you won't shake hands
You're so blown up with anger about the world
You write the songs about
Yet you don't even know your neighbors name
Now you want to go the the moon and live there
When you know it'll only end up the same
You strive to get ahead
But you leave each other dead
You get your kicks out of watching me cry
Why do you laugh when there are tears in my eyes
My skies are not so sunny
Why don't you make up your mind
Let me put my arms around you
Make rainbows all around you
But I don't know if you are mine
We could be happy till the very day I die
Why do you laugh when there are tears in my eyes
My skies are not so sunny
Why don't you make up your mind
Let me put my arms around you
Make rainbows all around you
But I don't know if you are mine
My skies are not so sunny
Why don't you make up your mind
Let me put my arms around you
Make rainbows all around you
But I don't know if you are mine
But I don't know if you are mine
Ooh. love was true yesterday
I saw you standing there
You gave me cause to stare
You could be mine if you tried
All that you do is tell me lies
You think that love's a game
But I don't feel the same
I should have known that I'll get the pain
I saw you standing there
You gave me cause to stare
Am I gonna have you for me
One little light I saw before
Give me a chance . Make up your mind
Give me romance . Tell me you're mine
Am gonna have you for me
Sweeter still when we're alone
Greener still when she's with me
The stars that night shine big and bright for me
She's true to me the way that she will always be
Sweeter still when we're alone
The stars that night shine big and bright for me
She's true to me the way that she will always be
Sweeter still when we're alone
I'm going to take you out tonight
I'm going to take you out tonight
I'm going to take you out tonight
You'll find a pot of gold
You'll find it's all been told
But our love has a treasure our hearts always spend
And it has a story without any end
The water stops its flow
But just tell me you love and you are only mine
And our love will go on till the end of time
But just tell me you love and you are only mine
And our love will go on till the end of time
She's my baby and she lives next door.
She brings my coffee in my favorite cup.
I know she'll go with me down to the end.
I smile a damn and say she told me so.
I hear her on my door.
Every single thing I try to do
I love you most of all because you're you
No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me
No matter what may be the style or season
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
Somewhere a place for us.
Peace and quiet and open air
There's a time for us.
We'll find a way of forgiving
A time and place for us.
Hold my hand and we're half way there.
Hold my hand and I'll take you there.
You ask how much I need you
I need you oh my darling
You ask how long I'll love you
Until the twelfth of never I'll still be loving you
Melt my heart like April snow
I'll love you till the blue bells forget to bloom
I'll love you till the clover has lost its perfume
I'll love you till the poets run out of rhyme
And that's a long long time
Until the twelfth of never
You're the reason I don't sleep at night
You're the reason I don't sleep at night
Smoke cigarettes and drink coffee too
You're the reason I don't sleep at night
Come over and keep me company
Strum my guitar and sing out a tune
You're nobody till somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares
The world still is the same
You'll never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody till somebody loves you
They always leave me on the shelf
I live my life all by myself
I live my life all by myself
I'm a man who stands alone
So take your hand down off my chair
I live my live all by myself
I live my life all by myself
I'm a man who stands alone
So take your hand down off my chair
And I ain't never seen no wealth
I live my live all by myself
Green fields where we used to wander
And you left me here to cry
Green fields where we used to wander
We would play there beneath the sky
We've been together for a long long time
And yet they try so very hard to pull us apart
But we don't care what they say
You know it'll only break my heart
And don't you know I love her so
No matter what the people may say or try to do
We've been together for a long long time
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she loves me too
People talk and try to break us up
When they know they don't understand
But I don't care what the people may say
Can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And yet they try so very hard to pull us apart
But we don't care what they say
You know it'll only break my heart
Don't you know I love her so
No matter what the people may say or try to do
We've been together for a long long time
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she loves me too
And it'll stay that way
If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love from me to you
I've got everything that you want
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love from me to you
I got arms that long to hold you
And keep you by my side
I got lips that long to kiss you
If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love from me to you
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love from me to you
I got arms that long to hold you
And keep you by my side I got lips that long to kiss you
If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love from me to you
Is it you my love that I can see
You are my love so baby I'm all right
So what will I do when baby you are gone
There are times that I should go away
To think of you and I
In the night time when I lie awake
And think of you in my heart
Oh wouldn't you believe me if I told you
When I think of things that ought to be
And I feel your hand in mine
Oh wouldn't you believe if I told you
When I think of things that ought to be
And I feel your hand in mine
Night is day and day is night
Need you girl you re not in sight
Now as my heart lies in pieces of eight
You were a part of my love but too late
This I think that you should know
I'd like to stay but I know you won't play
I only do the best I can
It's just a price that you must pay
So I go from town to town
They all say that I'm a clown
They play high and I play
They play high and I play
So I go from town to town
They all say that I'm a clown
They play high and I play down
They play high and I play
So I go from town to town
They all say that I'm a clown
They play high and I play down
People in their pride believe it's easier for them to leave
Lasting love is such a funny thing
When you're in love you're on the wings
When you're high and mighty you'll remember how I loved you
In the night is such a lonely time
I dream of you and that's a sign
It means that I am still a fool
And I am still so much in love with you
I remember all the words you were softly saying
How many times must I tell you I love
Tell you I love you times before
Don't believe that I'm worth all your kisses
How many birds will I see high and flying
How many birds will it take till I get you
My love for you will be stronger then truer
I'll look at you and there's no doubt
How many birds will I see high and flying
How many birds will it take till I get you
See the cracks upon the wall
We do not know the meaning of it all
Ain't no fire to warm my feet
Ain't got a nickel for a bit to ear
Ain't no mirror to comb my face
Just keep on going from place to place
Ain't got no lights above my head
Don't even bother to leave my bed
But then again you may not take me back
Oh just to put my hat back on your rack
Guess I don't know why I bother with myself
You will find a part of me in someone else
I never argued with the fact that she is mine
I only hurt her and kissed her three times out of nine
You have the edge to talk to men and make them feel at home
You spent that every lasting cent on someone that's not your own
Bear with me there's bound to be a chance
To heal the wound and start back our romance
I gained a heart and part of it is yours
Oh just to see my love walk through these doors
You don't care if rain falls in my room
You won't be there if trouble fills my spoon
I'm just a clown that plays around with misery in my way
She likes to wander and that's why I'm under
The spell of her jingle jangle
We used to cry on each others shoulder
She used to wander and that's why I'm under
The spell of her jingle jangle
It would take a lot to ease my pain from all these chains
I get so angry I could cry
Why do you leave me feeling bad they way I do
My daddy put me on his knee and showed me the way to go
I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man
If you got what it takes my boy
You can always choose
Work it out before it's too late my boy
Make sure you never lose
I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man
And where are the friends
The girl that I loved
I'm the kind of man you can't explain
True love is one thing I've been dreaming of
I give my love to you. And when I do
I'm anything that you want me to be
The shadows in my eyes don't make it good for
Me to see the way I should
I'm anything that you want me to be
I'm the kind of man that you can't explain
What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreaming boy
And now I'm lost in a daydream
And even if time ain't really on my side
I'm blowing the day to take a walk in the sun
And fall on my face on somebody's new mowed lawn
I've been having a sweet dream
Been dreaming since I woke up today
It's starring me and my sweet dream
And even if time is passing me by a lot
I couldn't care less about these blues you say I've got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping so low
And you can be sure that if you're feeling right
Tomorrow at breakfast you may perk up your ears
Or you may be daydreaming for a thousand years
What a day for a daydream
Custom made for a daydreaming boy
And now I'm lost in a daydream
There'll be rain till we run for cover
Lost in love in a world of strangers
Something only the Lord arranges
Want to live all my life around you
You're my light in a world of sorrow
Scared of losing this dream tomorrow
Loving one another that's how it should be
Try to rediscover no other but me
I lose the love that has always freed me
Never hearing you're golden laughter
Can't escape from the spell I'm under
I surrender to all your treasure
Endless nights of pain and pleasure
Try to rediscover no other but me
He's not such a very very old man
He's a soul man and he takes my hand
He makes a man feel good when he's down
Head is touching the ground
He's going to help you if he can
He's a whole man and he treats me nice
He makes a man feel good when he's down
Head is touching the ground
He's going to help you if he can
I need her loving so much the feeling is too much to bear
He's not such a very very old man
He's a soul man and he takes my hand
He makes a man feel good when he's down
Head is touching the ground
He's going to help you if he can
I need her loving so much the feeling is too much to bear
You've got to have somebody when she's not there
He's not such a very very old man
He's a soul man and he takes my hand
He's gonna help you when he's down
When your head is touching the ground
And he'll help you if he can
And my baby runs this show and she's got a big share.
Sold my car and I got no transport in this town.
Based on a novel by a man named Lear
It's the dirty story of a dirty man
And his clinging wife doesn't understand.
I'll be writing more in a week or two.
It could make a million for you overnight.
But if you fail . to keep it a tie
And I'll know what to do
You've got to wear that thing indefinitely
And I'll know what to do
Oh I'll know what to do
You will see me at the time I love the best
In the daytime I will meet you as before.
Building castles in the shifting sands
In the morning of my life the
Minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day
To the top right hand corner of
The ceiling in my room
It is the morning of my life
It is the morning of my life
I love you like nobody else
I love you like nobody else
I love you like nobody else
Put yourself in my place
Take a look at my face
The world I say is you
I love you and nobody else
I love you and nobody else
I love you and nobody else
I love you like nobody else
I love you like nobody else
It's gonna be a lonely winter.
And leave all the love we've known.
Autumn leaves will fall.
Wish winter would only call you back to me.
It's gonna be a lonely winter.
Till the winter's gone.
And the trees begin to bare.
But I know that you're not here.
I been the mayor in this old town
What they really don't know is
I'll be the biggest thing that's happened here
And that's the way it's gonna stay
I'm marrying her today
I'll be the biggest thing that's happened here
And that's the way it's gonna stay
Is it raining in the sunshine
And the wind blows in my eyes
Lying face down to the hard ground
I can face the cloudy skies
And although I maybe dying I will bide my love
You were my girl in the springtime
With the sunshine in my day
And you touch me but you won't stay
Is it raining in the sunshine
And the wind blows in my eyes
Lying face down to the hard ground
I can face the cloudy skies
And although I may be dying I will bide my love
I know that she loves you now
But your heart doesn't keep any vows
And that's a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way to hurt that girl
It's a terrible way you treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world
Her heart isn't for a game
For that's a terrible way to treat your baby
It's a terrible way you treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world
And if you give me the chance to take her hand
And try to change her mind
For it's a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way you hurt that girl
It's a terrible way to treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world
For it's a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way you hurt that girl
It's a terrible way to treat your baby
When you know that I love her
I loved you all the summer through
I thought I'd found my dream in you
For me you were the one
But that was yesterday and yesterday's gone
We walked together hand in hand
But now it's over and done
We had such happiness together
I can't believe it's gone forever
Wait till summer comes again
I hope that you'll remember when
Our love had just begun
I loved you yesterday and yesterday's gone
We had such happiness together
I can't believe it's gone forever
Wait till summer comes again
I hope that you'll remember when
Our love had just begun
I loved you yesterday and yesterday's gone
We have lost the time
That was so hard to find
And I will lost my mind
You should want to hide
But I can't get through
I don't gave much to say
But I can't turn away
You refuse to even listen
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And I just can't go on
You refuse to even listen
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And I just can't go on
It's a drag to leave my door
Guess I'll have to say
I just cry my life away
I'll buy a top hat to brighten up my lonely life
And they can see that I've got the money for the things money brings
Put it on my head and each time I head to bed
Put it in a box near my dirty shoes an socks
I'll but a top hat to brighten up my lonely life
And they can see that I've got the money for the things money brings
3 pound 6 then please sir.
I'll but a top hat to brighten up my lonely life
And they can see that I've got the money for the things money brings
And until she comes and she brings me happiness
Just one look and I felt so wild
Felt so wild in love with you
I found out how good it feels
Just how good to have your love
You'll be mine forever and always
Just one look and I knew
That you were my only one
I thought I was dreaming
But I'm gonna keep on scheming
Till I can make you all of my own
So you see I really care
Without you I'm nothing
Just one look and I know
The girl that's driving me mad
She said that living with me
Is bringing her down yeah.
For she would never be free
She ought to do right by me.
She ought to do right by me.
I think it's today yeah.
The girl that's driving me mad
She ought to do right by me.
She ought to do right by me
For she would never be free
I've read it over once or twice
A little bit of bad advice
Happened to me all my life
And who would get the sharpest knife
You know I shouldn't be somebody like that
I'm not the kind of man to throw his hat into the ring and
Go down without following through
The day turns into night
Go down without following through
The day turns into night
This is just where I came in
This is the danger zone
This is where I came in
They know not what they do
Forgive them of their sins
They know they cannot take away
What you have given me
This is just where I came in
Everything will be all right
Nothing ever stays the same
The love will never speak its name
Never gonna find somebody like you
Beauty with a brain and a body too
I could never make a move on a woman that leads me on
She's got a little bit of something for everyone
It's a little too late and the wolf is on the run
I would regret this day
That I would fall apart
And watch you walk away
That you would cry out loud
And I would stand aside
This is just where I came in
This is the danger zone
This is where I came in
They know not what they do
Forgive them of their sins
They know they cannot take away
What you have given me
This is just where I came in
This is just where I came in
I don't know how it happened then
What was she thinking of when
The way she touched me
And I ran that red light and so I
She tell me I don't matter
But every dream is shattered
Except the morning after
Look in the mirror like a rabbit in the headlights
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
Wrapped in each other
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She ain't no Cleopatra
I ain't no Julius Caesar
She ain't no Mona Lisa
She send you out to die
And we were flying when she ran that red light
She ain't no Greta Garbo
But when we come together
There's no one else can follow
There's no tomorrow when we run that red light
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on knocking at the door
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
Die in the arms of a lover
I close my eyes and she's gone
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
But she keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on knocking at the door
She keeps on coming back for more
I meant to fight it to the finish but you made me forget
I can't see the day for night
You know I twist around and turn around and then I give in
You end up in control of me it's really a sin
I don't know what you're doing to me
But I know it's a crime
And baby I can't last another night
And every moment is eternity
And from the depth of my soul
Can't let another day go by
I follow my heart right up to the end
As far as the eye can see
I'm faithful and true and living up to
Your sacred trust in me
I'll never give out to somebody else
I know where my arms should be
I'm faithful and true and making it through
Your sacred trust in me
Your sacred trust in me
You take me and you break me and you do what you please
I stumble and I tremble and I'm weak at the knees
The vision that lies before me is not reality
I tell you I can't wait another night
For every secret that your soul reveals
And you and I may get to know
I follow my heart that leads me to you
And you can be sure I'm doing it for
Your sacred trust in me
I'll never give out to somebody else
I'm faithful and true and living up to
Your sacred trust in me
Your sacred trust in me
I follow my heart right up to the end
As far as the eye can see
I'm faithful and true and living up to
Your sacred trust in me
I'll never give out to somebody else
I know where my arms should be
I'm faithful and true and making it through
Your sacred trust in me
I follow my heart that leads me to you
And you can be sure I'm doing it for
Your sacred trust in me
I'll never give out to somebody else
I'm faithful and true and living up to
Your sacred trust in me
We both acknowledge what we came here for
We take each other and walk through the open door
From the first time that I saw you
To the way you look tonight
I was shaken by your spirit
I was blinded by your light
And the world that I used to see is gone without a trace
Replaced by your eyes and the smile upon your face
And I will not turn away
I was haunted by your heart
And I felt that you were here
And funny when the time is right
When lightning strikes
The rest of our lives
There is nothing words can say
On this our wedding day
I will lay it at your feet
And the two of us escape from the sadness of the world
From the thunder and the darkness
From the hunger and the hurt
You know I will remember well the mission bell
And baby there could never be
There is nothing words can say
On this our wedding day
This is my pledge to you
I will follow through to the end
And we will find another plane
There is nothing words can say
On this our wedding day
You've got a plan that could never go wrong
You took advantage and the damage done
It all comes back to me baby
It all comes back to me
I played the fool and I went off the track
And when I think of all it cost
When the die was cast
You know I had to be crazy
I've been telling lies
And you forgive me but my heart still cries
And you can understand
I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the signs
I'm just a creature of habit
In a complicated world
I know I let you down in so many ways
I know that sorry doesn't tell you
What you need me to say
I've been in disguise
And you forgive me and our love will rise
And you can understand
I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the light
But I've just begun to fight
I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the signs
I'm just a creature of habit
In a complicated world
I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the light
But I've just begun to fight
I'm just the man in the middle
The fool of a man in the middle
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
I'm not a saint but stand accused
You're with someone who thinks love's the same as being used
And now suspicious minds may say it's over
Through the feast or famine I'll be with you
Sheltering arms reach out to you
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
You're with someone who says
They can get you through your pain
These golden years keep on returning
Through the feast or famine I'll be with you
Sheltering arms reach out to you
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
And cherish what they've lost
When often it's too late
Through the feast or famine
Sheltering arms reach out to you
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
Chasing some cinematic schemes
I'd like to show you how
I loved you way back then
As much as I need you now
Some people like to send the world away
Some sunlight on some silver beams
All of our dreams fulfill
I would implore you still
From under your windowsill
Some sunlight on some silver beams
I'll help you climb that hill
I would adore you still
Sometimes I'd like to send the world away
Some sunlight under some silver beams
I've been around the world
You'll never know just how long I've been praying
To get you into my life
It won't be long before you understand
I think I'm walking on air
So much in love I can't tell what I'm saying
There'll be no running away
You and I won't be apart again
I know in my heart that we can start again
When love's in the air
You answered my prayer
I see the games that you play
And I don't care what the people are saying
No other love can compare
Just to hold you in my arms again
I feel like walking on air
And just to dream you'll be there keeps me going
And all those days go by
We will never be apart again
Knowing our love will never die
When love's in the air
We'll be together this time of the year
We will never be apart again
Knowing our love will never die
Here comes the summer
You answered my prayer
Here comes the summer
Through year after year
You know I'm walking on air
I know I'm walking on air
Loose talk costs lives
We're basically the same
Loose talk costs lives
Don't look at me as if you don't remember me at all
But I won't make the same mistakes I made
You are too beautiful to me
I hide my tears inside the rain
Am I the soul you cast your spell upon
I had control and now it's gone
Or are you someone who controls my heart and mind
And I will never say a word
And I will never say goodbye
Loose talk costs lives
We're basically the same
Loose talk costs lives
I can see that someone hung a sign around your heart
And there is so much trouble I could cause
Someone as beautiful as you
You can feel my candle burn
And I still recall some starry night
I promised I would come to you and catch you if you fall
And they will never know about us
For just one moment you were mine
Loose talk costs lives
We're basically the same
Loose talk costs lives
Loose talk costs lives
We're basically the same
Loose talk costs lives
Loose talk costs lives
We're basically the same
Truth behind the lies
I long for your embrace
I long for your embrace
The power of the human heart
The secrets in the souls of men
All my blessings in disguise
Reunited we will rise
I long for your embrace
I long for your embrace
I long for your embrace
I long for your embrace
Living separate lives
Lonely days and nights
With our separate lives
Lonely days and nights
I will never send away
Embrace the child inside
I want to go where no one's gone before
And my faith will find the way
Now I am here with all that is true
You lived with my strength and my pain
I'm ready to walk that line
I'm not alone in the night
You're always in sight and it's so right
That extra mile for you
And my tears will fade away
Now I can steer my ship to the shore
I'm ready to walk that line
For once in your life let your soul shine through
That extra mile for you
Ready to walk that line
Weather the storm in the night
You're always in sight and it's so right
For once in your life let your soul shine through
She sparkle and I see the light
I miss her every moment she is out of sight
My baby keeps rolling me
She's got what causes chaos
She's got the power that I can't explain
Blowing through each other like a hurricane
I don't want to live like that
Don't want to live like that
Just another voice in the wilderness
Stick with me forever
Cross my heart and hope to die
You should give me everything and so will I
And the world will know
You know more lovers than one for some become a necessity
My baby keeps rolling me
Exposing my jealous rage
Life can be complicated
I give you something you can talk about
Love is like a prison and you can't get out
These things are hard to find
You say the world is flat but
I don't want to live like that
Don't want to live like that
Just another voice in the wilderness
Walking through the fire
I'm risking everything to be someone
We know but we will not fail
Lifting of the spirit and the flesh prevails
Into the clear blue sky
This is the age of wonder
I don't want to live like that
And I always held the faith inside
That love would find a way
And I always reached for more than the others ever saw
I was always the first to follow my foolish prayer
And the feeling that I have is more than any soul could bear
Then I can be sure of who I am
One of us got to be the one that's true
One for the other and the love comes through
Right here or out in space
Tell the world that I've come to claim your tomorrows
Let the universal word go out a million miles away
On the wind the seed is sown
We are living in a time where the tears fall where they might
But we hear each other much more than those who see
Love is there for everyone who needs
And for anyone who cries
I will always have you here with me
Safe under lock and key
Till I know it's only me
One of us has got to be the one that's true
One for the other and the love comes through
Safe under lock and key
Till I know it's only me
One of us has got to be the one that's true
One for the other and the love comes through
It's not worth one night on earth
I won't know whose lips you're kissing
You don't know what you have done
You don't know what you are missing
There's not a sacrifice too strong
I've been alone for far too long
With tears of emotion
If fate is a force that tears you apart
And we can turn back the time
I lay down with you in dreams
I was driven by this vision
If I could testify to you
Then I could prove my aim is true
If I am guilty or I'm innocent
With tears of emotion
If fate is a force that tears you apart
You're part of every dream
With tears of emotion
If fate is a force that tears you apart
With tears of emotion
If fate is a force that tears you apart
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
That never shone on me
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
In my brain I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
It's something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Ooh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
Can't think what I've just said
Put the soft pillow on my head
Millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
Yet millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
It's something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own.
Gotta do the things I wanna do.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
They brought me back to see my way with you.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen.
And of course it rains everyday.
And of course it rains everyday.
I'd remember all of the times I've gone wrong.
And of course it rains everyday.
Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
Cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory
Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
To take your heart away
The preacher talked to me and he smiled
Now for once in your life you're alone
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I told him I'm in no hurry
And for once in my life I'm alone
And I've got to let her know just in time before I go
I've just go to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I've just got to get a message to her
One more hour and my life will be through
Which started the whole world crying
That the joke was on me
Which started the whole world laughing
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Which started the whole world living
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Which started the whole world living
That the joke was on me
We used to love while others used to play
Some one else moved in from far away
And you don't ask the time of day
But guess we'll cry come first of May
The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine
And you don't ask the time of day
But guess we'll cry come first of May
Do do do do do do do do do...
Oh my heart won't believe that you have left me
I keep telling my self that it's true
I can get over anything you want my love
But I can't get myself over you
Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
Don't forget to remember me my love
On my wall lies a photograph of you girl
Though I try to forget you somehow
You're the mirror of my soul so take me out of my hole
Let me try to go on living right now
Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
I see you every morning
Outside the restaurants
The music plays so nonchalant
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
I can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrow
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
If ever you've got rain in your heart
Someone has hurt you and torn you apart
To open up your eyes to love me
And let it be like they said it would be
To open up your eyes to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder
And when you're out in the cold
No one beside you and no one to hold
To open up your eyes to love me
And when you've got nothing to lose
Nothing to pay for and nothing to choose
To open up your eyes to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Run to me whenever you're lonely
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Run to me whenever you're lonely
Run to me if you need a shoulder
You're really no good
Just what you mean to me
You're gonna take away my energy
Still gets in my eyes
There you go with your fancy lies
You just ain't no good
And if there's somebody
Still gets in my eyes
Nobody believe what you say
And if there's somebody
In a room full of strangers
Where your eyes couldn't see me
Though you did not want me to
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them love songs
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them sweet sounds
There are so many others
How long will they stand between us
Though you did not want me to
Singing them love songs
Singing them sweet sounds
Even if it takes forever
Even if it takes a lifetime
Somehow I feel inside
Make it like it was before
Even if it takes a lifetime
Seems like you don't want
The love of this man at all
And it's sure been a lonely time
Right up to the time I met you
So if you take a love like mine
You know how easy it is to hurt me
And my love won't desert me
So you say to yourself
Do you think I'm gonna stand here
And it's the start of a love affair
The moment when I first met you
You know how easy it is to break me
And my love won't forsake me
You'll always love me forever
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
And my love won't forsake me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
And my love won't forsake me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
And my love won't desert me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
And my love won't forsake me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
She came on like the night and she held on tight
And the world was right when she made love to me
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up
I was here and she was gone
Maybe you can tell me
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong
Where did she go when I need her close to me
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart
I could take it in my stride
Start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size
I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
And it just don't matter how I cry
My tears of love are a waste of time
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
And it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily
To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
I remember times my love when we really had it all
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
All I ever wanted was to have you to myself
Then I see you standing there in the arms of someone else
You know a man can stand so much
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Never even try to see things her way
It's hard on a woman when love ain't no love at all
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
I think I can work it out
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Together we can make it
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
She's juicy and she's trouble
She gets it to me good
My woman give me power
Goes right down to my blood
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
Tomorrow you can climb a mountain
Sail a sailboat through a fountain
Play no games he'd say to me when the light is gone
So please don't make no hesitation
There will be no recreation
And it's shattering to hear you mustn't listen with your ear
Don't shed a tear for me
If you're not here by me
Then it's not worth while
My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine
What do I do to have you stay
My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine
Don't shed a tear for me
That's not your style
If you're not here by me
She knows that life is a running race
Her face shouldn't show any signs
You can be beautiful too
You can be beautiful too
She knows that life is a running race
Her face shouldn't show any lines
You can be beautiful too
Don't shed a tear for me
If you're not here by me
Then it's not worth while
My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine
What do I do to have you stay
My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine
Don't shed a tear for me
That's not your style
If you're not here by me
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Well now I get low and I get high
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'll live to see another day
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you can look the other way
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
You know the door to my very soul
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
There is movement all around
On the waves of the air
If it's something we can share
And that sweet city woman
She move through the light
We know how to show it
We know how to show it
In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
I got fire in my mind
And I'm glowing in the dark
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
We know how to show it
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you
Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love I know I would die
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
And who is the one you're clinging to
And where are you now
That leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taking me over
And if you don't come back
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
I'm there at your side
And you got a part of someone else
You go to find your shinning star
And where are you now
That leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taking me over
And if you don't come back
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taking me over
And if you don't come back
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
It's just emotion that's taking me over
And if you don't come back
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more
I can see beyond forever
Everything we own will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night or day
And the tears we had to cry
I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we own will never die
When you are to me the light above
Made for all to see our precious love
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Love is such a beautiful thing
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Here I lie in a lost and lonely part of town
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and you don't know why
Night and day there's a burning down inside of me
Burning love with a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go and I just can't take it all alone
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
Your kisses taste like honey
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Too many heartaches in one lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Don't try to tell me it's all over
No man could love you more
You can't change the way I feel inside
You are the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
No man on earth can stand between my love and I
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I've got to to say it and it's hard for me
You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing but you let me down
How can I love you when you ain't around
And I get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you
Only to find that the dream that I follow is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
This is a lesson that I never knew
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
My love is stronger than the universe
You made the rules and you could not see
You made a life out of hurting me
Out of my mind I am held by the power of you love
This is a lesson that I never knew
This is a lesson that I never knew
When I was being what you want me to be
Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
Islands in the stream
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
Islands in the stream
Islands in the stream
Reaching for the stars
Couldn't figure why you couldn't give me what everybody needs
Find out everybody knows that you've been using me
I'm surprised you let me stay around you
One day I'm gonna lift the cover and look inside your heart
We've got a little bit before we go and tear this love apart
This battle of love with me
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
I'm gonna hit you from all sides
Lay your fortress open wide
Nobody stops this body from taking you
I'm gonna be there one day when you fall
I could never let you cast aside
The greatest love of all
This battle of love with me
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
Just as my life fades to darkness
You you make me see the light.
Show me that my search is over
Someone can love so completely
One kiss should break the seal.
Truth can be stranger than fiction
You'll be my only possession
I'll be a slave to you
We hold the power together
And every breath you take is planned
And there are two of us
Sleep pretty baby while you wait so long
Together we can take away
The time and the space
Baby when you got a secret love
Every little touch is not enough
Every little moment we're apart is pain to me
Maybe we can find some hideaway
Everybody knows but who can say
Secretly you know I'd follow
Anywhere to make you happy
Anyway you want me I'll be standing by
I don't wanna lose the one I hunger for
Everything to lose and no alibi
Baby when you got a secret love
Secretly you know I'd follow
Anywhere to make you happy
And there are two of us
Baby when you got a secret love
Secretly you know I'd follow
I stumble in the night
Never really knew what it would've been like
You're no longer there to
The heartache over you
I gave it everything but I couldn't get through
I never saw the signs
You're the last to know when love is blind
All the tears and the turbulent years
When I would not wait for no one
And see me losing you
When the lonely heart breaks
It's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more
And the fire that will roar
There's a hole in my soul
And for me it's to cry
For whom the bell tolls
Seen you in a magazine
Where you shouldn't have been
I'm still in love with you
Won't you come back to your little boy blue
I've come to feel inside
This precious love was never mine
Now I know but a little too late
That I could not live without you
In the dark of the broad daylight
I promise I'll be there
When the lonely heart breaks
It's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more
And the fire that will roar
There's a hole in my soul
And for me it's to cry
For whom the bell tolls
I never knew there'd be times like this
When I couldn't reach out to no one
Am I never gonna find someone
That knows me like you do
Are you leaving me a helpless child
When it took so long to save me
Fight the devil and the deep blue sea
I'll follow you anywhere
I promise I'll be there
When the lonely heart breaks
It's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more
And the fire that will roar
There's a hole in my soul
And for me it's to cry
I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I could hear you breathing
With a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
And for the state I'm in
And all the wonders made for the Earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone
Just the beat of a lonely heart
I don't want to be alone
And since you're busy every minute
I make believe you care
I feel you everywhere
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
Am I the subject of the pain
Am I the stranger in the rain
And if there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination
Another story there to be told
And I pray it's not too late
Just a beat of a lonely heart
I don't want to be alone
And all the wonders made for the Earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told
And I pray it's not too late
Just a beat of a lonely heart
I don't want to be alone
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone
Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of sight
And this is all I know
And I must choose to live
For all that I can give
The spark that makes the power grow
But I will stand for one dream if I can
Symbol of my faith in who I am
And I must follow on the road that lies ahead
I won't let my heart control my head
And we don't say goodbye
And I know what I've got to be...
I make my journey through eternity
I keep the memory of you and me
It's there within the child
My storm will never end
My fate is on the wind
I'll make them all remember me
Every ounce of me must see it through
I'm sorry I don't have the role for love to play
Hand over my heart I'll find my way
I will make them give to me...
There is a vision and a fire in me
I keep the memory of you and me
And we don't say goodbye
In all my love for you
And what else we may do
I've read it over once or twice
A little bit of bad advice
Happened to me all my life
And who would get the sharpest knife
You know I shouldn't be somebody like that
I'm not the kind of man to throw his hat into the ring and
Go down without following through
The day turns into night
Go down without following through
The day turns into night
This is just where I came in
This is the danger zone
This is where I came in
They know not what they do
Forgive them of their sins
They know they cannot take away
What you have given me
This is just where I came in
Everything will be all right
Nothing ever stays the same
The love will never speak its name
Never gonna find somebody like you
Beauty with a brain and a body too
I could never make a move on a woman that leads me on
She's got a little bit of something for everyone
It's a little too late and the wolf is on the run
I would regret this day
That I would fall apart
And watch you walk away
That you would cry out loud
And I would stand aside
This is just where I came in
This is the danger zone
This is where I came in
They know not what they do
Forgive them of their sins
They know they cannot take away
What you have given me
This is just where I came in
This is just where I came in
And where are the friends
The girl that I loved
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own.
Gotta do the things I wanna do.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
They brought me back to see my way with you.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen.
That never shone on me
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
In my brain I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
You're really no good
Just what you mean to me
You're gonna take away my energy
Still gets in my eyes
There you go with your fancy lies
You just ain't no good
And if there's somebody
Still gets in my eyes
Nobody believe what you say
And if there's somebody
I can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrow
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
You know the door to my very soul
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own.
Gotta do the things I wanna do.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
They brought me back to see my way with you.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen.
And of course it rains everyday.
And of course it rains everyday.
I'd remember all of the times I've gone wrong.
And of course it rains everyday.
Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
Cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory
Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
To take your heart away
The preacher talked to me and he smiled
Now for once in your life you're alone
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I told him I'm in no hurry
And for once in my life I'm alone
And I've got to let her know just in time before I go
I've just go to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I've just got to get a message to her
One more hour and my life will be through
Which started the whole world crying
That the joke was on me
Which started the whole world laughing
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Which started the whole world living
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Which started the whole world living
That the joke was on me
Oh my heart won't believe that you have left me
I keep telling my self that it's true
I can get over anything you want my love
But I can't get myself over you
Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
Don't forget to remember me my love
On my wall lies a photograph of you girl
Though I try to forget you somehow
You're the mirror of my soul so take me out of my hole
Let me try to go on living right now
Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
I can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrow
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
You're really no good
Just what you mean to me
You're gonna take away my energy
Still gets in my eyes
There you go with your fancy lies
You just ain't no good
And if there's somebody
Still gets in my eyes
Nobody believe what you say
And if there's somebody
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
She's juicy and she's trouble
She gets it to me good
My woman give me power
Goes right down to my blood
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
You know the door to my very soul
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Well now I get low and I get high
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'll live to see another day
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you can look the other way

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
There is movement all around
On the waves of the air
If it's something we can share
And that sweet city woman
She move through the light
We know how to show it
We know how to show it
In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
I got fire in my mind
And I'm glowing in the dark
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
We know how to show it
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more
I can see beyond forever
Everything we own will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night or day
And the tears we had to cry
I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we own will never die
When you are to me the light above
Made for all to see our precious love
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Love is such a beautiful thing
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Here I lie in a lost and lonely part of town
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and you don't know why
Night and day there's a burning down inside of me
Burning love with a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go and I just can't take it all alone
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you
Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love I know I would die
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
Your kisses taste like honey
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Too many heartaches in one lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Don't try to tell me it's all over
No man could love you more
You can't change the way I feel inside
You are the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
No man on earth can stand between my love and I
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
Couldn't figure why you couldn't give me what everybody needs
Find out everybody knows that you've been using me
I'm surprised you let me stay around you
One day I'm gonna lift the cover and look inside your heart
We've got a little bit before we go and tear this love apart
This battle of love with me
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
I'm gonna hit you from all sides
Lay your fortress open wide
Nobody stops this body from taking you
I'm gonna be there one day when you fall
I could never let you cast aside
The greatest love of all
This battle of love with me
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
You've got a plan that could never go wrong
You took advantage and the damage done
It all comes back to me baby
It all comes back to me
I played the fool and I went off the track
And when I think of all it cost
When the die was cast
You know I had to be crazy
I've been telling lies
And you forgive me but my heart still cries
And you can understand
I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the signs
I'm just a creature of habit
In a complicated world
I know I let you down in so many ways
I know that sorry doesn't tell you
What you need me to say
I've been in disguise
And you forgive me and our love will rise
And you can understand
I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the light
But I've just begun to fight
I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the signs
I'm just a creature of habit
In a complicated world
I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the light
But I've just begun to fight
I'm just the man in the middle
The fool of a man in the middle
Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
Islands in the stream
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
Islands in the stream
Islands in the stream
Reaching for the stars
And this is all I know
And I must choose to live
For all that I can give
The spark that makes the power grow
But I will stand for one dream if I can
Symbol of my faith in who I am
And I must follow on the road that lies ahead
I won't let my heart control my head
And we don't say goodbye
And I know what I've got to be...
I make my journey through eternity
I keep the memory of you and me
It's there within the child
My storm will never end
My fate is on the wind
I'll make them all remember me
Every ounce of me must see it through
I'm sorry I don't have the role for love to play
Hand over my heart I'll find my way
I will make them give to me...
There is a vision and a fire in me
I keep the memory of you and me
And we don't say goodbye
In all my love for you
And what else we may do
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own.
Gotta do the things I wanna do.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
They brought me back to see my way with you.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen.
And of course it rains everyday.
And of course it rains everyday.
I'd remember all of the times I've gone wrong.
And of course it rains everyday.
Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
Cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory
Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
To take your heart away
The preacher talked to me and he smiled
Now for once in your life you're alone
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I told him I'm in no hurry
And for once in my life I'm alone
And I've got to let her know just in time before I go
I've just go to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I've just got to get a message to her
One more hour and my life will be through
Which started the whole world crying
That the joke was on me
Which started the whole world laughing
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Which started the whole world living
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Which started the whole world living
That the joke was on me
Oh my heart won't believe that you have left me
I keep telling my self that it's true
I can get over anything you want my love
But I can't get myself over you
Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
Don't forget to remember me my love
On my wall lies a photograph of you girl
Though I try to forget you somehow
You're the mirror of my soul so take me out of my hole
Let me try to go on living right now
Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
I see you every morning
Outside the restaurants
The music plays so nonchalant
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
I can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrow
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
You're really no good
Just what you mean to me
You're gonna take away my energy
Still gets in my eyes
There you go with your fancy lies
You just ain't no good
And if there's somebody
Still gets in my eyes
Nobody believe what you say
And if there's somebody
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
She's juicy and she's trouble
She gets it to me good
My woman give me power
Goes right down to my blood
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
She came on like the night and she held on tight
And the world was right when she made love to me
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up
I was here and she was gone
Maybe you can tell me
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong
Where did she go when I need her close to me
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart
I could take it in my stride
Start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
You know the door to my very soul
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Well now I get low and I get high
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'll live to see another day
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you can look the other way
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
There is movement all around
On the waves of the air
If it's something we can share
And that sweet city woman
She move through the light
We know how to show it
We know how to show it
In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
I got fire in my mind
And I'm glowing in the dark
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
We know how to show it
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more
I can see beyond forever
Everything we own will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night or day
And the tears we had to cry
I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we own will never die
When you are to me the light above
Made for all to see our precious love
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Love is such a beautiful thing
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Here I lie in a lost and lonely part of town
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and you don't know why
Night and day there's a burning down inside of me
Burning love with a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go and I just can't take it all alone
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
Your kisses taste like honey
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Too many heartaches in one lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Don't try to tell me it's all over
No man could love you more
You can't change the way I feel inside
You are the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
No man on earth can stand between my love and I
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
Couldn't figure why you couldn't give me what everybody needs
Find out everybody knows that you've been using me
I'm surprised you let me stay around you
One day I'm gonna lift the cover and look inside your heart
We've got a little bit before we go and tear this love apart
This battle of love with me
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
I'm gonna hit you from all sides
Lay your fortress open wide
Nobody stops this body from taking you
I'm gonna be there one day when you fall
I could never let you cast aside
The greatest love of all
This battle of love with me
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
You've got a plan that could never go wrong
You took advantage and the damage done
It all comes back to me baby
It all comes back to me
I played the fool and I went off the track
And when I think of all it cost
When the die was cast
You know I had to be crazy
I've been telling lies
And you forgive me but my heart still cries
And you can understand
I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the signs
I'm just a creature of habit
In a complicated world
I know I let you down in so many ways
I know that sorry doesn't tell you
What you need me to say
I've been in disguise
And you forgive me and our love will rise
And you can understand
I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the light
But I've just begun to fight
I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the signs
I'm just a creature of habit
In a complicated world
I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the light
But I've just begun to fight
I'm just the man in the middle
The fool of a man in the middle
That never shone on me
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
In my brain I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
Cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory
Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
To take your heart away
We used to love while others used to play
Some one else moved in from far away
And you don't ask the time of day
But guess we'll cry come first of May
The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine
And you don't ask the time of day
But guess we'll cry come first of May
Do do do do do do do do do...
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
I see you every morning
Outside the restaurants
The music plays so nonchalant
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
I can think of younger days

Please help me mend my broken heart

I know your eyes in the morning sun

I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you
Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love I know I would die
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
Maybe I don't wanna know the reason why
But lately you don't talk to me
Darling I can't see me in your eyes
I hold you near but you're so far away
And it's losing you I can't believe
To watch you leave and let this feeling die
You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
And tomorrow if I'm here without your love
You know I can't survive
Only my love can raise you high above it all
We can take the darkness and make if full of light
But let your love flow back to me
How can you leave and let this feeling die
This happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone
And I won't even have your shoulders for the crying on
We changed the world we made it ours to hold
But dreams are made for those who really try
This losing you is real
But I still feel you here inside
And who is the one you're clinging to
And where are you now
That leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taking me over
And if you don't come back
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
I'm there at your side
And you got a part of someone else
You go to find your shinning star
And where are you now
That leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taking me over
And if you don't come back
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taking me over
And if you don't come back
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
It's just emotion that's taking me over
And if you don't come back
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me

I can see beyond forever
Everything we own will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing

Nobody gets too much love anymore

It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
I've got to to say it and it's hard for me
You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing but you let me down
How can I love you when you ain't around
And I get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you
Only to find that the dream that I follow is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
This is a lesson that I never knew
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
My love is stronger than the universe
You made the rules and you could not see
You made a life out of hurting me
Out of my mind I am held by the power of you love
This is a lesson that I never knew
This is a lesson that I never knew
When I was being what you want me to be
Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
Islands in the stream
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
Islands in the stream
Islands in the stream
Reaching for the stars
I steal the night away
I was just one of the guys
And I thought I had it made
I needed someone to show me how to love
The night was magic when we first met
You know you taught me to fly
You take me clear to the sky
And all the people around the world can stand aside
I was an average guy in a world of empty dreams
You've broken down all the walls with your love
You know you taught me to fly
You take me clear to the sky
And all the people around the world can stand aside
It keeps going strong throughout eternity
You know you taught me to fly
You take me clear to the sky
And all the people around the world can stand aside
And there are two of us
Sleep pretty baby while you wait so long
Together we can take away
The time and the space
Baby when you got a secret love
Every little touch is not enough
Every little moment we're apart is pain to me
Maybe we can find some hideaway
Everybody knows but who can say
Secretly you know I'd follow
Anywhere to make you happy
Anyway you want me I'll be standing by
I don't wanna lose the one I hunger for
Everything to lose and no alibi
Baby when you got a secret love
Secretly you know I'd follow
Anywhere to make you happy
And there are two of us
Baby when you got a secret love
Secretly you know I'd follow
I stumble in the night
Never really knew what it would've been like
You're no longer there to
The heartache over you
I gave it everything but I couldn't get through
I never saw the signs
You're the last to know when love is blind
All the tears and the turbulent years
When I would not wait for no one
And see me losing you
When the lonely heart breaks
It's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more
And the fire that will roar
There's a hole in my soul
And for me it's to cry
For whom the bell tolls
Seen you in a magazine
Where you shouldn't have been
I'm still in love with you
Won't you come back to your little boy blue
I've come to feel inside
This precious love was never mine
Now I know but a little too late
That I could not live without you
In the dark of the broad daylight
I promise I'll be there
When the lonely heart breaks
It's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more
And the fire that will roar
There's a hole in my soul
And for me it's to cry
For whom the bell tolls
I never knew there'd be times like this
When I couldn't reach out to no one
Am I never gonna find someone
That knows me like you do
Are you leaving me a helpless child
When it took so long to save me
Fight the devil and the deep blue sea
I'll follow you anywhere
I promise I'll be there
When the lonely heart breaks
It's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more
And the fire that will roar
There's a hole in my soul
And for me it's to cry
She'll read your mind
She's smart as a whip
But look at how much I drip
At the point of ecstasy
Let no one take her place
To confide in someone
And look at how much I paid
I want you next to me
We drifted into vision
And look at how much we see
I just wanna get closer than close to you
To the moment you discover
What the best of my love can do
And lovers fall for lover's friends
We make each other cry
Living in each others lives
It tells you what you want
And look at how close I've come
There's more for us to see
We both end up in heaven
And look at how close we'd be
I just wanna get closer than close to you
I know that one way or the other
Any test of my faith will do
I give my heart for you to break
I give my final breath
When nothing last forever see
We can turn eternity into
No more hide and seek
You are the highest dream to me
And as you softly sleep
Then I can tell you what it means
Locked in my arms like lovers lie
I will not let you slip away
Is this my night of nights
That you came to stay
Just the way that love should be
And there is something I must say to you
If you promise to believe
That it's you I'm living for
Seasons may come and seasons go
But these are the truest words I know
This is the summer of our lives
One love that cannot die
Never let you say goodbye
And there is something I must say to you
We leave the world outside
Let my deepest love inside
I'm only doing what I have to do
If you promise to believe
That it's you I'm living for
We both acknowledge what we came here for
We take each other and walk through the open door
From the first time that I saw you
To the way you look tonight
I was shaken by your spirit
I was blinded by your light
And the world that I used to see is gone without a trace
Replaced by your eyes and the smile upon your face
And I will not turn away
I was haunted by your heart
And I felt that you were here
And funny when the time is right
When lightning strikes
The rest of our lives
There is nothing words can say
On this our wedding day
I will lay it at your feet
And the two of us escape from the sadness of the world
From the thunder and the darkness
From the hunger and the hurt
You know I will remember well the mission bell
And baby there could never be
There is nothing words can say
On this our wedding day
This is my pledge to you
I will follow through to the end
And we will find another plane
There is nothing words can say
On this our wedding day
I've been lonely so much
Nothing in life is the same
And the sooner we stop to start
And there's a heart like mine
Somewhere in this world
There's a heart like mine
Beating but left to burn
Maybe you can hide your face forever
That when you search for someone
There's a heart like mine
There's a heart like mine
Feel her voice in your ear
Nothing you say could be wrong
And there's a heart like mine
Somewhere in this world
There's a heart like mine
Beating but left to burn
Maybe we can share it all forever
I'm gonna search for someone
There's a heart like mine
There's a heart like mine
And baby are we waking up together
If there is love for someone
And there's a heart like mine
Somewhere in this world
There's a heart like mine
Beating but left to burn
Maybe we can share it all forever
I'm gonna search for someone
There's a heart like mine
There's a heart like mine
There's a heart like mine
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
She's juicy and she's trouble
She gets it to me good
My woman give me power
Goes right down to my blood
My baby moves at midnight
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Well now I get low and I get high
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'll live to see another day
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you can look the other way
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
You're really no good
Just what you mean to me
You're gonna take away my energy
Still gets in my eyes
There you go with your fancy lies
You just ain't no good
And if there's somebody
Still gets in my eyes
Nobody believe what you say
And if there's somebody
In a room full of strangers
Where your eyes couldn't see me
Though you did not want me to
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them love songs
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them sweet sounds
There are so many others
How long will they stand between us
Though you did not want me to
Singing them love songs
Singing them sweet sounds
Even if it takes forever
Even if it takes a lifetime
Somehow I feel inside
Make it like it was before
Even if it takes a lifetime
Here I lie in a lost and lonely part of town
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and you don't know why
Night and day there's a burning down inside of me
Burning love with a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go and I just can't take it all alone
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
There is movement all around
On the waves of the air
If it's something we can share
And that sweet city woman
She move through the light
We know how to show it
We know how to show it
In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
I got fire in my mind
And I'm glowing in the dark
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
We know how to show it
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you
Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love I know I would die
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
Seems like you don't want
The love of this man at all
And it's sure been a lonely time
Right up to the time I met you
So if you take a love like mine
You know how easy it is to hurt me
And my love won't desert me
So you say to yourself
Do you think I'm gonna stand here
And it's the start of a love affair
The moment when I first met you
You know how easy it is to break me
And my love won't forsake me
You'll always love me forever
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
And my love won't forsake me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
And my love won't forsake me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
And my love won't desert me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
And my love won't forsake me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
I never fell in love so easily.
Where the four winds blow I carry on.
Through the empty skies.
Faster than lightening is this heart of mine.
In the face of time I carry on.
I'd like to take you where my rainbow ends.
Your fire in the sun.
It's the dawn of the feeling
That starts from the moment you're there.
You'll never know what you have done for me.
You broke all those rules I live upon.
Your fire in the sun.
It's the dawn of the feeling
That starts from the moment you're there.
There I'd like to take you where my spirit flies
Through the empty skies.
I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
And it just don't matter how I cry
My tears of love are a waste of time
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
And it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily
To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
When you move it like you really know how to move me
I follow you wherever you go
Come on boogie child let your love light shine
Your kisses taste like honey
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Too many heartaches in one lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Don't try to tell me it's all over
No man could love you more
You can't change the way I feel inside
You are the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
No man on earth can stand between my love and I
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
Couldn't figure why you couldn't give me what everybody needs
Find out everybody knows that you've been using me
I'm surprised you let me stay around you
One day I'm gonna lift the cover and look inside your heart
We've got a little bit before we go and tear this love apart
This battle of love with me
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
I'm gonna hit you from all sides
Lay your fortress open wide
Nobody stops this body from taking you
I'm gonna be there one day when you fall
I could never let you cast aside
The greatest love of all
This battle of love with me
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
Just as my life fades to darkness
You you make me see the light.
Show me that my search is over
Someone can love so completely
One kiss should break the seal.
Truth can be stranger than fiction
You'll be my only possession
I'll be a slave to you
We hold the power together
And every breath you take is planned
And there are two of us
Sleep pretty baby while you wait so long
Together we can take away
The time and the space
Baby when you got a secret love
Every little touch is not enough
Every little moment we're apart is pain to me
Maybe we can find some hideaway
Everybody knows but who can say
Secretly you know I'd follow
Anywhere to make you happy
Anyway you want me I'll be standing by
I don't wanna lose the one I hunger for
Everything to lose and no alibi
Baby when you got a secret love
Secretly you know I'd follow
Anywhere to make you happy
And there are two of us
Baby when you got a secret love
Secretly you know I'd follow
I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I could hear you breathing
With a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
And for the state I'm in
And all the wonders made for the Earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone
Just the beat of a lonely heart
I don't want to be alone
And since you're busy every minute
I make believe you care
I feel you everywhere
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
Am I the subject of the pain
Am I the stranger in the rain
And if there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination
Another story there to be told
And I pray it's not too late
Just a beat of a lonely heart
I don't want to be alone
And all the wonders made for the Earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told
And I pray it's not too late
Just a beat of a lonely heart
I don't want to be alone
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone
Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of sight
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
Reflection will show this connection
We can lean on each other
This is all we need to know
I believe I may be losing you
Under your spell and over my head
We don't need to worry
How can we survive if we change what is real
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
Reflection will show this connection
We can lean on each other
This is all we need to know
I see the angel and the devil in your heart
And where you're leading me
I don't have the will to fight
Out of the darkness and into the light
Please don't make me shiver
I know together we deliver
Let the gods decide who finds the sweetest thrill
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection
This is all we need to know
Don't let him get too close to you
You've got a stranger on your mind
I know I'm only human if I cry
Or maybe we should kiss and say goodbye
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection
This is all we need to know
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
Reflection will show this connection
We can lean on each other
I've read it over once or twice
A little bit of bad advice
Happened to me all my life
And who would get the sharpest knife
You know I shouldn't be somebody like that
I'm not the kind of man to throw his hat into the ring and
Go down without following through
The day turns into night
Go down without following through
The day turns into night
This is just where I came in
This is the danger zone
This is where I came in
They know not what they do
Forgive them of their sins
They know they cannot take away
What you have given me
This is just where I came in
Everything will be all right
Nothing ever stays the same
The love will never speak its name
Never gonna find somebody like you
Beauty with a brain and a body too
I could never make a move on a woman that leads me on
She's got a little bit of something for everyone
It's a little too late and the wolf is on the run
I would regret this day
That I would fall apart
And watch you walk away
That you would cry out loud
And I would stand aside
This is just where I came in
This is the danger zone
This is where I came in
They know not what they do
Forgive them of their sins
They know they cannot take away
What you have given me
This is just where I came in
This is just where I came in
And where are the friends
The girl that I loved
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
You know the door to my very soul
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
That never shone on me
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
In my brain I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
Cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory
Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
To take your heart away
I can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrow
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more
I can see beyond forever
Everything we own will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night or day
And the tears we had to cry
I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we own will never die
When you are to me the light above
Made for all to see our precious love
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Love is such a beautiful thing
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And who is the one you're clinging to
And where are you now
That leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taking me over
And if you don't come back
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
I'm there at your side
And you got a part of someone else
You go to find your shinning star
And where are you now
That leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taking me over
And if you don't come back
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taking me over
And if you don't come back
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
It's just emotion that's taking me over
And if you don't come back
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
I see you every morning
Outside the restaurants
The music plays so nonchalant
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
Where would I be without my woman
If ever you've got rain in your heart
Someone has hurt you and torn you apart
To open up your eyes to love me
And let it be like they said it would be
To open up your eyes to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder
And when you're out in the cold
No one beside you and no one to hold
To open up your eyes to love me
And when you've got nothing to lose
Nothing to pay for and nothing to choose
To open up your eyes to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Run to me whenever you're lonely
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Run to me whenever you're lonely
Run to me if you need a shoulder
She came on like the night and she held on tight
And the world was right when she made love to me
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up
I was here and she was gone
Maybe you can tell me
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong
Where did she go when I need her close to me
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart
I could take it in my stride
Start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size
I stumble in the night
Never really knew what it would've been like
You're no longer there to
The heartache over you
I gave it everything but I couldn't get through
I never saw the signs
You're the last to know when love is blind
All the tears and the turbulent years
When I would not wait for no one
And see me losing you
When the lonely heart breaks
It's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more
And the fire that will roar
There's a hole in my soul
And for me it's to cry
For whom the bell tolls
Seen you in a magazine
Where you shouldn't have been
I'm still in love with you
Won't you come back to your little boy blue
I've come to feel inside
This precious love was never mine
Now I know but a little too late
That I could not live without you
In the dark of the broad daylight
I promise I'll be there
When the lonely heart breaks
It's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more
And the fire that will roar
There's a hole in my soul
And for me it's to cry
For whom the bell tolls
I never knew there'd be times like this
When I couldn't reach out to no one
Am I never gonna find someone
That knows me like you do
Are you leaving me a helpless child
When it took so long to save me
Fight the devil and the deep blue sea
I'll follow you anywhere
I promise I'll be there
When the lonely heart breaks
It's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more
And the fire that will roar
There's a hole in my soul
And for me it's to cry
The preacher talked to me and he smiled
Now for once in your life you're alone
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I told him I'm in no hurry
And for once in my life I'm alone
And I've got to let her know just in time before I go
I've just go to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I've just got to get a message to her
One more hour and my life will be through
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own.
Gotta do the things I wanna do.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
They brought me back to see my way with you.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen.
Which started the whole world crying
That the joke was on me
Which started the whole world laughing
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Which started the whole world living
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Which started the whole world living
That the joke was on me
And of course it rains everyday.
And of course it rains everyday.
I'd remember all of the times I've gone wrong.
And of course it rains everyday.
We used to love while others used to play
Some one else moved in from far away
And you don't ask the time of day
But guess we'll cry come first of May
The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine
And you don't ask the time of day
But guess we'll cry come first of May
Do do do do do do do do do...
It's something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Ooh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
Can't think what I've just said
Put the soft pillow on my head
Millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
Yet millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
It's something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Oh my heart won't believe that you have left me
I keep telling my self that it's true
I can get over anything you want my love
But I can't get myself over you
Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
Don't forget to remember me my love
On my wall lies a photograph of you girl
Though I try to forget you somehow
You're the mirror of my soul so take me out of my hole
Let me try to go on living right now
Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
Islands in the stream
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
Islands in the stream
Islands in the stream
Reaching for the stars
I've got to to say it and it's hard for me
You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing but you let me down
How can I love you when you ain't around
And I get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you
Only to find that the dream that I follow is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
This is a lesson that I never knew
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
My love is stronger than the universe
You made the rules and you could not see
You made a life out of hurting me
Out of my mind I am held by the power of you love
This is a lesson that I never knew
This is a lesson that I never knew
When I was being what you want me to be
Out on the street anybody you meet
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we never let it end
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
Don't wanna hear your goodbye
Little by little we meet in the middle
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we never let it end
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
Don't wanna hear your goodbye
Don't wanna hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of
And we never let it end
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
Don't wanna hear your goodbye
Don't wanna hear your
I never fell in love so easily.
Where the four winds blow I carry on.
Through the empty skies.
Faster than lightening is this heart of mine.
In the face of time I carry on.
I'd like to take you where my rainbow ends.
Your fire in the sun.
It's the dawn of the feeling
That starts from the moment you're there.
You'll never know what you have done for me.
You broke all those rules I live upon.
Your fire in the sun.
It's the dawn of the feeling
That starts from the moment you're there.
There I'd like to take you where my spirit flies
Through the empty skies.
Couldn't figure why you couldn't give me what everybody needs
Find out everybody knows that you've been using me
I'm surprised you let me stay around you
One day I'm gonna lift the cover and look inside your heart
We've got a little bit before we go and tear this love apart
This battle of love with me

The greatest love of all
This battle of love with me
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
You're really no good
Just what you mean to me
You're gonna take away my energy
Still gets in my eyes
There you go with your fancy lies
You just ain't no good
And if there's somebody
Still gets in my eyes
Nobody believe what you say
And if there's somebody
That never shone on me
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
In my brain I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
Here I lie in a lost and lonely part of town
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and you don't know why
Night and day there's a burning down inside of me
Burning love with a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go and I just can't take it all alone
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
When you lose control and you got no soul
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
When the morning cries and you don't know why
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more
I can see beyond forever
Everything we own will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night or day
And the tears we had to cry
I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we own will never die
When you are to me the light above
Made for all to see our precious love
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Love is such a beautiful thing
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
We used to love while others used to play
Some one else moved in from far away
And you don't ask the time of day
But guess we'll cry come first of May
The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine
And you don't ask the time of day
But guess we'll cry come first of May
Do do do do do do do do do...
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you
Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love I know I would die
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
More than a woman to me
She came on like the night and she held on tight
And the world was right when she made love to me
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up
I was here and she was gone
Maybe you can tell me
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong
Where did she go when I need her close to me
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart
I could take it in my stride
Start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size
There is movement all around
On the waves of the air
If it's something we can share
And that sweet city woman
She move through the light
We know how to show it
We know how to show it
In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
I got fire in my mind
And I'm glowing in the dark
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
We know how to show it
Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
Cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory
Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
You think that I don't even mean
To take your heart away
To take your heart away
Oh my heart won't believe that you have left me
I keep telling my self that it's true
I can get over anything you want my love
But I can't get myself over you
Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
Don't forget to remember me my love
On my wall lies a photograph of you girl
Though I try to forget you somehow
You're the mirror of my soul so take me out of my hole
Let me try to go on living right now
Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
And it just don't matter how I cry
My tears of love are a waste of time
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
And it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily
To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I could hear you breathing
With a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
And for the state I'm in
And all the wonders made for the Earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone
Just the beat of a lonely heart
I don't want to be alone
And since you're busy every minute
I make believe you care
I feel you everywhere
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
Am I the subject of the pain
Am I the stranger in the rain
And if there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination
Another story there to be told
And I pray it's not too late
Just a beat of a lonely heart
I don't want to be alone
And all the wonders made for the Earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told
And I pray it's not too late
Just a beat of a lonely heart
I don't want to be alone
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone
Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of sight
I've got to to say it and it's hard for me
You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing but you let me down
How can I love you when you ain't around
And I get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you
Only to find that the dream that I follow is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
This is a lesson that I never knew
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
My love is stronger than the universe
You made the rules and you could not see
You made a life out of hurting me
Out of my mind I am held by the power of you love
This is a lesson that I never knew
This is a lesson that I never knew
When I was being what you want me to be
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
You know the door to my very soul
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I really mean to learn
Your kisses taste like honey
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Too many heartaches in one lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Don't try to tell me it's all over
No man could love you more
You can't change the way I feel inside
You are the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
No man on earth can stand between my love and I
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Well now I get low and I get high
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'll live to see another day
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And you can look the other way
But we can try to understand
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Life going nowhere somebody help me
Barker sing me a song
There must be something there
There must be something there
Barker sing me a song
Never before have I seen the like
Barker sing me a song
This is my swan song.
This is my swan song.
I fell in love with you I love you well.
My love will build a castle in the air.
A chance to show the world that I am strong.
This is my last dance.
I'm walking off the floor where I belong.
My love will build a castle in the air.
My love will build a castle in the air.
This is my swan song.
And where are the friends
The girl that I loved
I'm the kind of man you can't explain
True love is one thing I've been dreaming of
I give my love to you. And when I do
I'm anything that you want me to be
The shadows in my eyes don't make it good for
Me to see the way I should
I'm anything that you want me to be
I'm the kind of man that you can't explain
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew
I used to smile and say hello. Guess I was just a happy guy.
I just can't move myself. I guess it all just had to be.
Mine eyes can only look at you... you.
I watched the falling rain and listened to the sweet birds sing.
Mine eyes can only look at you... you.
Every single word you hear... is coming from this heart of mine.
I never felt like this before... a love like yours so young and fine.
And now as I try to forget you... it doesn't work out any way.
I loved you such a long time ago... but in my eyes you'll always be.
I loved you such a long time ago... don't know why...
And I don't know why... baby...
Mine eyes can only look at you... you.
It's something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Ooh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
Can't think what I've just said
Put the soft pillow on my head
Millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
Yet millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
It's something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own.
Gotta do the things I wanna do.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
They brought me back to see my way with you.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen.
Laughing at people with stars in their eyes
Talking with the lambs who came out of the sky
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
Laughing at people with stars in their eyes
Talking with the lambs who came out of the sky
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You should be here standing so near to me.
But give me time alone to get it out of my mind.
Though say I know it's only the weather.
And the sun will shine if just for you.
Trains walk by and the birds disappear.
But why am I still here without you by my side.
And the rain will fall.
And the clouds will break
And the sun will shine
He'd sing his song most every night
Wishing she was there behind the light
The people danced and sang along
On the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong
And the piper played the tune
And the drummer wore his spurs
But the song that the singer sang was for her
Now the singer's song is never heard
And the visions he once saw are disappeared
Now they never dance or sing along
But on the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong
And the piper played the tune
And the drummer wore his spurs
But the song that the singer sang was for her
The preacher talked to me and he smiled
Now for once in your life you're alone
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I told him I'm in no hurry
And for once in my life I'm alone
And I've got to let her know just in time before I go
I've just go to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
I've just got to get a message to you
One more hour and my life will be through
I've just got to get a message to her
One more hour and my life will be through
Which started the whole world crying
That the joke was on me
Which started the whole world laughing
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Which started the whole world living
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Which started the whole world living
That the joke was on me
The British ship Veronica was lost without a sign.
Captain Richardson left himself a lonely wife in Hull.
I'm on an iceberg running free
Sailing my way back to your lips
One passing ship gave word that
You have moved out of your old flat
You love the Vicar more then words can say
Tell him to pray that I won't melt away
And I'll see your face again
They haven't got their dog anymore
Can't seem to leave the sea anymore
I just can't understand why you just moved to Finland
You love that Vicar more then words can say
Ask him to pray that I won't melt away
And I'll see your face again
Don't shed a tear for me
If you're not here by me
Then it's not worth while
My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine
What do I do to have you stay
My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine
Don't shed a tear for me
That's not your style
If you're not here by me
If ever you've got rain in your heart
Someone has hurt you and torn you apart
To open up your eyes to love me
And let it be like they said it would be
To open up your eyes to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder
And when you're out in the cold
No one beside you and no one to hold
To open up your eyes to love me
And when you've got nothing to lose
Nothing to pay for and nothing to choose
To open up your eyes to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Run to me whenever you're lonely
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Run to me whenever you're lonely
Run to me if you need a shoulder
I remember times my love when we really had it all
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
All I ever wanted was to have you to myself
Then I see you standing there in the arms of someone else
You know a man can stand so much
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Never even try to see things her way
It's hard on a woman when love ain't no love at all
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
I think I can work it out
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Together we can make it
I steal the night away
I was just one of the guys
And I thought I had it made
I needed someone to show me how to love
The night was magic when we first met
You know you taught me to fly
You take me clear to the sky
And all the people around the world can stand aside
I was an average guy in a world of empty dreams
You've broken down all the walls with your love
You know you taught me to fly
You take me clear to the sky
And all the people around the world can stand aside
It keeps going strong throughout eternity
You know you taught me to fly
You take me clear to the sky
And all the people around the world can stand aside
You know a love so fine
Goes on forever but the road is rough
Try to live without it
We don't talk about it
We can love each other when the lights go out
Anyone can see I'm walking alone
In your quiet moments
In your silent prayer
I'll be with you baby
On your longest night
I'll be with you baby
On your longest night
You know it breaks my heart
And it hurts my pride
To know I lost you to the world outside
Feeling when you touch me
Try to live without it
We don't talk about it
We can love each other
When the candle glows
And the moment is gone
On your longest night
I'll be with you baby
And it makes me wanna die
In your quiet moments
In your silent prayer
I'll be with you baby
On your longest night
I'll be with you baby
Fool in the night on the stair
With the light by the window
Out in the jungle of life she was
All of the years I've been there for the tears
Out in the city she search for the face
Did you believe that a love so alive
Fool is the father who clings to the
Mother too weary to question
There with your head in your hand
As you pray to her picture
Out in the rain she would search
Did you believe you could find
What you need with a stranger
Did you believe that a love so alive
If you're lonely in the black of night
I was falling and you helped me get it right
And I pray for the sign
And I won't be too late
If you just come down
I can look you in the eye
I can tell you that I love you
And my love will never die
And it's time that you know
Just how far I mean to go
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
And I wake up by your side
And I lay down my life
If you just take time
And be sure of who you are
We can take it up to heaven
We can walk amongst the stars
And I know if you stay
I will never turn away
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
And I pray for the sign
And I won't be too late
If you just take time
And be sure of who you are
We can take it up to heaven
We can walk amongst the stars
And I know if you stay
I will never turn away
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
Truth behind the lies
I long for your embrace
I long for your embrace
The power of the human heart
The secrets in the souls of men
All my blessings in disguise
Reunited we will rise
I long for your embrace
I long for your embrace
I long for your embrace
I long for your embrace
Living separate lives
Lonely days and nights
With our separate lives
Lonely days and nights
I will never send away
Embrace the child inside
Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
Islands in the stream
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
Islands in the stream
Islands in the stream
Reaching for the stars
You've got a plan that could never go wrong
You took advantage and the damage done
It all comes back to me baby
It all comes back to me
I played the fool and I went off the track
And when I think of all it cost
When the die was cast
You know I had to be crazy
I've been telling lies
And you forgive me but my heart still cries
And you can understand
I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the signs
I'm just a creature of habit
In a complicated world
I know I let you down in so many ways
I know that sorry doesn't tell you
What you need me to say
I've been in disguise
And you forgive me and our love will rise
And you can understand
I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the light
But I've just begun to fight
I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the signs
I'm just a creature of habit
In a complicated world
I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the light
But I've just begun to fight
I'm just the man in the middle
The fool of a man in the middle
She'll read your mind
She's smart as a whip
But look at how much I drip
At the point of ecstasy
Let no one take her place
To confide in someone
And look at how much I paid
I want you next to me
We drifted into vision
And look at how much we see
I just wanna get closer than close to you
To the moment you discover
What the best of my love can do
And lovers fall for lover's friends
We make each other cry
Living in each others lives
It tells you what you want
And look at how close I've come
There's more for us to see
We both end up in heaven
And look at how close we'd be
I just wanna get closer than close to you
I know that one way or the other
Any test of my faith will do
I give my heart for you to break
I give my final breath
When nothing last forever see
We can turn eternity into
She give me trouble enough
And she's a ball of light
I'm in the tunnel of love
With the American dream
And I was born too soon
She got me climbing the walls
Got me hard as a rock
And I'd be the one to know
When am I gonna go to your dimension
When am I gonna go to where you are
When am I gonna go to your dimension
And she's a way of life
And whether dead or alive
In every muscle and bone
She was a love machine
And she could wrestle me down
And get a taste of me
How can the body know
When am I gonna go to your dimension
When am I gonna go to where you are
When am I gonna go to your dimension
Something good in giving in
You must be made of stone.
Just when I was safe and sound
Love you built a wall around
You take a hard line attitude
Time to send me back to school
Easy on your body when you got no name.
Show me the way inside.
You can knock on any door
I know what I'm looking for
Time to turn the engine on
Pretty girl lives all alone
Hot as hell and cold as ice
Everything I sacrifice
I got to pick up on what you do
I just can't get over you
Easy on your body when you got no name.
Show me the way inside.
I nearly gave myself away.
Easy on your body when you got no name.
Show me the way inside.
Easy on the body when you've got no name
Hold me like you know me
Show me the way inside
Hold me like you know me
Show me the way inside
Hold me like you know me
Suddenly there's a boy in the rain alone.
Suddenly there's a girl in the rain alone.
Suddenly there's a girl in your heart oh boy.
Suddenly there's a boy in your heart oh boy.
Suddenly there's a boy in the rain alone.
Suddenly there's a girl in the rain alone.
They say a fool never learns
You agree I'm not superstitious
You know unlucky as I've been
And you can tell me to go
I've been reading your true confessions
But then you don't believe I'd let
Sorry that I've been so far away
You know I'm only human
It's the call of the wild
It's the law of the jungle
Won't you stay with me overnight
Give a little bit to you
Won't you stay with me stay
Won't you stay with me overnight
It'll be forever if you stay with me
As long as time will allow
You'll be losing your inhibitions
One night is not enough
For all the love to grow
And baby you and I rule the world
Maybe I could be your magician
Just give me long enough
Live in every corner of your heart
You know I'm only human
It's the call of the wild
It's the law of the jungle
Won't you stay with me overnight
Give a little bit to you
Won't you stay with me stay
Won't you stay with me overnight
It'll be forever if you stay with me
Stay with me overnight
Stay with me overnight
Stay with me overnight
It's just the way that I feel about tomorrow.
I'll be sad and alone all the time.
I can't believe what you're saying.
Just the way that I feel about tomorrow.
Knowing you won't be there by my side.
And I'm proud of that fact as you can plainly see.
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.
I spend my life working up a sweat to be a bad boy.
Going from town to town. Now I tell you I've been around.
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.
Lay it on me ... yeah...
And I'm proud of that fact as you can plainly see.
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.
I rolled into the smoke and there I lost my hope
I need someone to know me and to show me
The square peg fits the hole
I need someone to know me and to show me
Ten hundred people roam through the place I call me home
I need someone to know me and to show me
Don't need no one to show me
We set the same scene
Circumstances different than they
People in two places can be
Never what you're fighting for
Never makes it easy when you try too hard
I wish you would define what you feel
Hard on or letting go
Stand tall and understand
Everybody needs a plan
There'll be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
We share the same pain
Underneath the covers I will set you free
I will prove to you my love is
Stronger than the night is long
Let it be together if we rise or fall
Or is it just my imagination
Or the light of a precious stone
Everybody needs a plan
There'll be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
Here at the scene of the crime
Laid in your arms I will die
I know it's more than infatuation
That's keeping this man alive
Stand tall and understand
Everybody needs a plan
There'll be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
Everybody needs a plan
There'll be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
I've been around the world
You'll never know just how long I've been praying
To get you into my life
It won't be long before you understand
I think I'm walking on air
So much in love I can't tell what I'm saying
There'll be no running away
You and I won't be apart again
I know in my heart that we can start again
When love's in the air
You answered my prayer
I see the games that you play
And I don't care what the people are saying
No other love can compare
Just to hold you in my arms again
I feel like walking on air
And just to dream you'll be there keeps me going
And all those days go by
We will never be apart again
Knowing our love will never die
When love's in the air
We'll be together this time of the year
We will never be apart again
Knowing our love will never die
Here comes the summer
You answered my prayer
Here comes the summer
Through year after year
You know I'm walking on air
I know I'm walking on air
The first time I met you I knew you were the devil's daughter
And that would only bring me down
To rise to fall but can you forgive me
I sail upon this mortal storm
And hearts that cry and love is to leave me
I know my aim is true
It keeps this flame from dying
I know that I'll find you
So it's to my God in heaven that I pray
The voice is on the wind
I know my aim is true
It keeps my flame from dying
I know that I'll find you
So it's to my God in heaven that I pray
Sailing on a sea of gold
Where silver wings of angels go
I can see a million miles
That love goes on forever
Write a letter in the sand
That only lovers understand
And when the words are said and done
That we must come together
Sailing on a sea of gold
Where silver wings of angels go
I can see a million miles
Woman in a million to me
I never loved so much
Is it any wonder I'm alive
No one ever knows what makes a
Let it be the spell I'm under
Let it be the rain and thunder comes
I go above and beyond the sun
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
I'd give it all for you and me
Love is the earth and the wind
And the fire and the soul
Love is above and beyond any eye to behold
Love is the key and the cause
Every little touch I'm paralyzed
No one ever know what makes
Let me be the one to taste you
No pity if the city ever crumbles down
I go above and beyond the sun
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
I'd give it all for you and me
Love is the earth and the wind
And the fire and we share
Love is the force and the edge
And it's ready for those who dare
Love is above and beyond
And I'm taking you there
I go above and beyond the sun
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
I'd give it all for you and me
Love is the earth and the wind
And the fire and the soul
Love is the key and the cause
Love is the force and the edge
And it's yours if you dare
Love is above and beyond
And I'm taking you there
I go above and beyond the sun
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
All my love's for you.
Still I think it's time you made up your own mind.
Still I'll wait for you.
Love is here for you.
Sacrifice everything in a wonderland that you know
It's crazy that I'm clear out of my mind
A wonderful place to be
Sweet as the morning light
If I blink an eye will you go
I'm starting to care much more then I dare
A wonderful thing to see
First say you love me
And then say you leave me
But we never say goodbye
But even an angel must choose
Someone will hurt you and when you stop running
There's only this love of mine
Sacrifice everything in a wonderland that you know
One look in your eyes
I'm younger then I should be
First say you love me and then say you'll leave me
But we never say goodbye
But only an angel must choose
Someone will hurt you and when you stop running
I got myself a coach ticket on the Southern railroad line
You walked out the door and the only thing I saw was the hall light
I got myself a coach ticket on the Southern railroad line
Why didn't you see that you don't feel the same way as I do
I understood before that you couldn't take much more as I knew
I got myself a coach ticket on the Southern railroad line
When I was young I dreamed of you
Now I know what love has done
When I was young I looked to you
You were the world I never knew
Through the years we all have grown
Knowing your love forever strong
Time after time after time
In younger days I felt for you
With all the pain that we went through
We believe the one above
Now that we crossed the bridge of tears
Finding truth and facing fears
Walk across the bridge
Walk across the bridge
Time after time after time
Walk across the bridge
Walk across the bridge
You'll never be far away
You'll never be far away
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
He blew his mind out in a car
He hadn't noticed that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
I'd love to turn you on
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire
The celebrated Mr. K.
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry the Horse dances the waltz
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
Carry that weight a long time
Carry that weight a long time
Carry that weight a long time
Carry that weight a long time
And you're on your own you're in the street.
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
People running round it's five o'clock.
Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
It's time for tea and meet the wife.
You know I want you so bad
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
You don't know what you're missing
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans
Making all his nowhere plans
Making all his nowhere plans
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
It was twenty years ago today
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home
I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought that you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you have enjoyed the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're sorry but it's time to go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We'd like to thank you once again
Sgt. Pepper's one and only Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's getting very near the end
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon.
Tuesday's on the phone to me.
She said she'd always been a dancer.
She worked at fifteen clubs a day.
Well I knew what I could not say.
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job.
She could steal but she could not rob.
Tuesday's on the phone to me.
Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
Stepping outside she is free
She's leaving home after living alone
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
She's leaving home after living alone
It don't matter who you are
Brighter than the lightning
You go as far as you go
You got to be what you know
There may be somebody out to get the better of you
You need the one good woman to keep you alive
Don't let the pressure beat a hole in your head
Remember nobody left you on the railway line
And if the one shoe fits you've got a chance this time
Ain't no one gonna break your heart
You'll never do it if you never start
You gotta be a story told
If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night
You've got it all and then you're lost in flight
There are diamonds in the street
But you don't get enough to eat
There is a future unknown
And maybe you can be the thunder
If you follow your dream
There must be one good woman to show you the way
Don't let them make you feel you're less than you are
And all the world gets crazy and you win this time
Ain't no one gonna break your heart
You'll never do it if you never start
You gotta be the story told
If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night
You've got it all and then you're lost in flight
Ain't no one gonna break your heart
You'll never do it if you never start
You gotta be the story told
If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night
You gotta be the story told
You say you don't need me
I know where your love goes
You go missing after midnight
I should know better and the bed is cold
And if you think I'm not the real thing
I don't wanna die of hunger
I got my world created for you
Not my imagination no more
I can't be dealing with the bad girl
You go and take a strangers love instead
Over you is where I should be
I could be loving you too much
Under me is where you should be
I could be loving you too much
You know I love the way you do it
You ain't no one man woman
If you don't come back running
When you've had enough
Show me what's left of your love
Over you is where I should be
I could be loving you too much
Under me is where you should be
I could be loving you too much
I won't be no dirty weekend
I stay with you for good
He can be your outside lover
I know he's in your blood
Just let me hold you for the hour
I go where you lead me
I need some inspiration from you
Don't let me drown down here in the rain
You love a stranger and the world is pain
Over you is where I should be
I could be loving you too much
Under me is where you should be
I could be loving you too much
You throw those angel eyes at me
Or could the beautiful woman be more than she seems
But she is not in love with me
All of my life I been looking for someone to carry my love away
It's got to be growing
I can't wait no longer
Life goes on for the lonely man
When love goes wrong only love knows why
Life goes on for the lonely man
You disappear into the crowd
Maybe the beautiful woman never really came
But I still call your name out loud
If a wandering soul meets another
They shouldn't be separated
Better in love with your head on my shoulder
But I'll never be satisfied
And if I can't see you
Life goes on for the lonely man
Life goes on for the lonely man
Living your life in someone else's heart
A lover's dream that has no end
There may be somebody you can base your world upon
I'll never be the same again
And there's a part of me here
And there's a part of me with you
But all of me loves you
Nobody gave me the feeling you gave me
All of my days I will be here for you
And the love keeps running
And if I can't hold you
Life goes on for the lonely man
And there's a million words for the one goodbye
Life goes on for the lonely man
Life goes on for the lonely man
And there's a million words for the one goodbye
Life goes on for the lonely man
England in the summer is a pretty sight
Flowers in the meadow in the morning light
And the dream is taking you there
There's a little bit of heaven on the village green
And they take all comers in the month of June
They all say it couldn't be real
And when the sun and the moment is gone
We played a part in the heart of a beautiful memory
There's a baby in a cradle and a wise old man
Young lovers happy to be hand in hand
They will learn the secret in time
There's a ring on her finger
And a love that shows
There's a wind in the willows
People disappearing in the golden sun
I thought I'd already touched the sky
I got to know you and I don't know why
But all of my life couldn't mean as much
As just being touched by you
I never thought of me growing up
Got my directions but the road was rough
It's only the dream of a teenage queen
But somehow I made it through
Those faces of those friends I left behind
And even those who spoke for me
Just trying to be kind
And no one said I love you just the way
Living inside your heart
The giving and the taking
I love being in love with you
Thank you just for choosing me
Being in love forever
I stare and wonder at what I found
I just discovered why the world is round
Round in a circle my arms will be
And doing the same as you
It ain't right it's only for you and me
Only the lonely so it separately
Keep it alive on the food of love
But only the chosen few
In my life you see some changes in me
We listen and we grow
Any child that clings to childish things
I'd thought I'd seen as far as I could see
You took a mystery and made me want it
You got a pedestal and put me on it
You made me love you out of feeling nothing
Something that you do
And I was there and not dancing with anyone
You set your mark on stealing my heart away
I'm in the middle of a chain reaction
You give me all the after midnight action
I wanna get you where I can let you make all that love to me
I'm on a journey for the inspiration
To anywhere and there ain't no salvation
I need you to get me nearer to you
So you can set me free
You make me tremble when your hand moves lower
You taste a little and you swallow slower
Nature has a way of yielding treasure
Shine a light for the whole world over
You never find your love if you hide away
Get in the middle of a chain reaction
You get a medal when you're lost in action
I wanna get your love all ready for the sweet sensation
You let me hold you for the first explosion
We get a picture of our love in motion
With no more left to say
You let me hold you for the first explosion
All you gotta do is get in the middle of a chain reaction
You get a medal when you're lost in action
What a very special time for me.
I'll remember what a night.
But I'm never gonna be the same.
She was everything I dreamed she'd be.
I felt the rush at the rolling balls of thunder.
When the summer day is over
It's busy cares have flown
I will sit beneath the starlight
With a weary heart alone
Then it rises like a vision
Sparkling bright it shines for me
With it's green hills by the sea
Let me hear the ocean murmur
Let me watch your stormy sky
Then above the emerald waters
Sings the seagull as she flies
Then it rises like a vision
Sparkling bright it shines for me
With it's green hills by the sea
And in all my times of sorrow
And on some lonely shore
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Golden Slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Carry that weight a long time
I saw my problems and I'll see the light
Grease is the way we are feeling
We take the pressure and we throw away conventionality
There is a chance that we can make it so far
Grease is the way we are feeling
There is a chance that we can make it so far
Grease is the way we are feeling
Grease is the way we are feeling
Maybe I don't want to know the reason why
But lately you don't talk to me
Darling I can't see me in your eyes
I hold you near but you're so far away
And it's losing you I can't believe
To watch you leave and let this feeling die
You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
And tomorrow if I'm here without your love
You know I can't survive
Only my love can raise you high above it all
We can take the darkness and make if full of light
But let your love flow back to me
How can you leave and let this feeling die
This happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone
And I won't even have your shoulders for the crying on
We changed the world we made it ours to hold
But dreams are made for those who really try
This losing you is real
But I still feel you here inside
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you have enjoyed the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're sorry but it's time to go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We'd like to thank you once again
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's getting very near the end
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We'd like to thank you once again
Sgt. Pepper's one and only Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's getting very near the end
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It belongs to you and me
We're gonna kiss so tenderly
Underneath the starlight of love
Come on along and take my hand
And pretty soon you'll understand
Underneath the starlight of love
Is that the moon I see
It belongs to you and me
We're gonna kiss so tenderly
Underneath the starlight of love
Is that the moon I see
It belongs to you and me
We're gonna kiss so tenderly
Tears don't fall and dreams come true
There have been so many dreams for you
Ain't that nice but you can't go
You can send your mother to say hello
To the blue sky and the blue sea
To see those palm trees swaying
And you can hear them singing
Their voices ringing across the bay
To make all your dreams come true for the rest of your life
We've gotta be a team on a life crusade
What a place of wonder that the world can be
For the young girls and the young boys
I still can hear those palm trees swaying
And you can hear them singing their voices ringing across the bay
To make all your dreams come true
To make all your dreams come true
Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Is this a lasting treasure
Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I am the only one
But will my heart be broken
Is love I can be sure of
Will you still need me
Love is turned to silence
And I forgive the violence
To understand the feeling
Hide away your weakness
Behind your finer secrets
Blow away your sadness
And hope that under kindness
So put your arms around me
Cause all I want from you is hope to live
So put your arms around me
Cause all I want from you is hope to live
The hope of understanding
While you're just sending powers
Help me find the meaning
Cause now you are beginning
So put your arms around me
Cause all I want from you is hope to live
So put your arms around me
Cause all I want from you is hope to live
So put your arms around me
Cause all I want from you is hope to live
So put your arms around me
Cause all I want from you is hope to live
So put your arms around me
I find no point in making sense
In everything that we say next
Don't ask me how I'm feeling
Just keeping time we're sinking
This lonely sun's a power
Every time you're with me
Perfect sense is a crime
Every time you're with me
Perfect sense is a crime
Lets live our love and not expect
Don't ask me how I'm feeling
Just keeping tight we're sinking
This lonely sun's a power
Every time you're with me
Perfect sense is a crime
Every time you're with me
Perfect sense is a crime
How many times you find the answer
For the questions in your mind
How many times you see the future
No matter how some words are spoken
And after all is said and done
Although some things were meant to be
You know you're always gonna be
Although somethings were meant to be
You know you're always gonna
How many times you know you've fallen
Into the doubt you keep inside
How many times you feel the time has stopped
I find no point in making sense
In everything that we say next
Don't ask me how I'm feeling
Just keeping time we're sinking
This lonely sun's a power
Every time you're with me
Perfect sense is a crime
Every time you're with me
Perfect sense is a crime
Lets live our love and not expect
Don't ask me how I'm feeling
Just keeping tight we're sinking
This lonely sun's a power
Every time you're with me
Perfect sense is a crime
Every time you're with me
Perfect sense is a crime
And I catch your time
Would you just stay with me
Would you still follow me
For a slice of heaven
In a world that's almost
Feeling lonely harsh without you
For a slice of heaven
In the most peculiar way
For you all night long
Would you just be my words
And I'd close my eyes
Would you be there for me
For a slice of heaven
In a world that's almost even
Feeling lonely harsh without you
For a slice of heaven
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love you'll meet
But this time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
I've even seen her maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection
This time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
And I wait for the phone to ring
To send my fears away
Tell me why I believe in a lie
Tell me why all I want is you
When you call me baby
And you tell me love me maybe
When you call me baby
When you call me baby
And you tell me love me maybe
When you call me baby
I was feeling so complete
The day that I met you
Now I'm setting on my own
Tell me why I believe in a lie
Tell me why all I want is you
When you call me baby
And you tell me love me maybe
When you call me baby
When you call me baby
And you tell me love me maybe
When you call me baby
When you call me baby
And you tell me love me maybe
When you call me baby
When you call me baby
And you tell me love me maybe
When you call me baby
You always see love as a game
And you had your share of a play
But now it's the time to come by
And collect your winnings
Then I haven't tried so hard
To follow my way to your heart
But each time you push me away
This is my chance to say goodbye
It's time to spread my wings and fly
Feels like I'm walking on ice
So you better think again twice
So take a good look right at me
And watch how I break myself free
You better stop fooling yourself
This is my chance to say goodbye
It's time to spread my wings and fly
This is my chance to say goodbye
It's time to spread my wings and fly
All it had you instant cold
You're a winner with bad souvenirs
You will always be so strong
Hold on tight to your dreams
So hold on to your dreams
All or nothing you can give
Strong enough till the morning light
You're too tough to lose this game
You will always be so strong
Hold on tight to your dreams
So hold on to your dreams
You will always be so strong
Hold on tight to your dreams
I'm looking in your eyes
You might be mine tonight
Spend the night with me
I can feel it everywhere
There's magic in the air
You might be mine tonight
I see heaven in your eyes
He's a midnight true romancer
He is the nearest thing to heaven
You shot a hole in my soul
You shot a hole in my soul
Dreams go on forever and ever
Good things do not last forever
Heaven can wait but I can't
You shot a hole in my soul
You shot a hole in my soul
Every little thing's been said about it
Make you know you light up my day
Everybody hates to live without it
And I hope you don't go away
A pillow soft with tears
I can forget my fears
One night's not enough
One night's not enough
Breaking up breaks my heart
The way you love is very special to me
Maybe my dreams will come true
And I know if you should ever leave me
I will never feel so brand new
Maybe behind your eyes
There will be bad surprise
You get all my love away from me
Breaking up breaks my heart
Love lost it's meaning
It will never stop bleeding
When you're down and feeling blue
Making love for him was fun
He never needed anyone
Be strangers tomorrow
The light is fooling your heart
And lovers tonight inside our hearts
Sometimes be strangers today
Strange are the ways of this world
For your hard times it's too late
Be strangers tomorrow
The light is fooling your heart
And lovers tonight inside our hearts
Sometimes be strangers today
Be strangers tomorrow
Tonight be careful with love
Sometimes be strangers today
The extreme is played with hearts
Troubles storm are paradise maybe
If it's too hot to stop maybe
I'm hungry for your love
You always play a game tonight
Two wrongs never make it right
Let's try a brand new start
I dry the tears I never show
Wasted days and wasted nights
Always hurt the one you love
Helpless fire of desire
Are the ways of love to me
I'm hungry for your love
You always play a game tonight
Two wrongs never make it right
Let's try a brand new start
Take me tight in your arms
Take me in your heart tonight
If you really want me
Got to learn to love me right
It's tearing me apart
Only young heroes can never wait
You are my number one
Till the morning turns to dawn
You are dancing in my mind
Take me to the end of time
When you give that special smile
Only young heroes can never wait
You are my number one
Till the morning turns to dawn
It doesn't matter when we'll start
Only young heroes can never wait
You are my number one
Till the morning turns to dawn
Only your heroes can never wait
You can be my lucky star tonight
When you're young and in love
But never behave like a child
There are times in your life
You've been wondering why
I'll give you a reason
How can I live without love
Your heart and break the rules
We are living in a Heartbreak Hotel
I'm feeling there's no love you can save
I'm shooting from my heart
We're living and we're lost without love
We're living in a Heartbreak Hotel
The eyes of a child are weak and wild
We are living in a Heartbreak Hotel
The stars in the sky above
It's strange and sometimes it makes you blue
We are living in a Heartbreak Hotel
I'm feeling there's no love you can save
I'm shooting from my heart
We're living and we're lost without love
We're living in a Heartbreak Hotel
The eyes of a child are weak and wild
We are living in a Heartbreak Hotel
We are living in a Heartbreak Hotel
I'm feeling there's no love you can save
I'm shooting from my heart
We're living and we're lost without love
We're living in a Heartbreak Hotel
Strange are the ways of lies
I'm more than a woman
Trust me baby to the end
Love is what it means to be so young
I need your sweet love devotion
The countdown for love
Need your sweet emotions
Breaks the rules of the light
And I'm lost in your love
Our love's burning bright
That is nothing at all
I know it's now or never
I need your sweet love devotion
The countdown for love
Need your sweet emotions
Breaks the rules of the light
And I'm lost in your love
Our love's burning bright
That is nothing at all
I need your sweet love devotion
The countdown for love
Need your sweet emotions
I need your picture blue eyes
Feel the shadows of a heartache.
Feel the shadows of a heartache.
It's too late for a try.
Years may come and years may go.
In the shadows of a heartache.
I'll be afraid I'm losing you.
I'll go save my life babe.
I know my heart's succeeding.
I'm tossing and I'm turning.
I know the hearts are mine.
I know my heart's succeeding.
I'm tossing and I'm turning.
I know she's a Venus in blue jeans
You can't run away from it
We are night birds in the street
You can save your heart
You can lose my heart a bit
You can't run away from it
You can't see the chance
You can't run away from it
You can't run away from it
We are night birds in the street
You can save your heart
You can lose my heart a bit
You can't run away from it
You can't see the chance
You can't run away from it
Everybody needs someone to love
Be careful in the night
Letters full of tears will tell
You've got no time to lose
Behind the painted smile
Everybody needs some love tonight
Be careful in the night
Letters full of tears will tell
You've got no time to lose
Letters full of tears will tell
You've got no time to lose
Daytime friends and nighttime fools
Dreaming all that dreams come true
Dreaming like the big guys do
From a day in paradise
And a life without a lie
Don't stop these Hollywood nights
Stop these Hollywood nights
Dreams are more than a little wish
There is a will and there is a way
You'll build the pain another day
You can make it if you try
Don't stop these Hollywood nights
Stop these Hollywood nights
Don't stop these Hollywood nights
Don't stop these Hollywood nights
Over and over I'm crying
Easier said and done for you
That's where my heartache blow
That's where my feelings go
Hold back the tears and fight
Tossing and turning before
Never there will be another you
That's where my heartache blow
That's where my feelings go
Hold back the tears and fight
You have no heart of stone
Reach out of the dead
Long as the rose is red
Do anything you wanna do
Nights are forever without you
Do anything you wanna do
Nothing can take the place of you
Good love can never die
My hope is still alive
Don't treat me like a child
I've almost lost my mind
Do anything you wanna do
Nights are forever without you
Do anything you wanna do
I'm qualified too satisfied

Shadows and dark deep devotion
My heart is in your hands
But baby are you really tough
Oh baby are you really tough

Love me like there's no tomorrow
Give up the fears and the sorrows
Passion of love stays forever

Over and over we'll try a start
King of fools take your time
Now I feel your love again
Over and over I need that stuff
Over and over we'll try a start
It's a hard time for lovers
And a broken dream to you
It's like a burning fire
He pulls the strings of my deep emotions
Stop your lipstick lies
He will spend the night together
Love will never be the same
It's like a burning fire
He pulls the strings of my deep emotions
It's the night of my burning dream
I never wanna lose you baby
It's like a burning fire
When I watched my dreams all fade away
Oh don't tell me how the story ends
You're a million miles away
And you're playing every day
He's a midnight gambler
On a highway of fools
Why you're breaking my heart boy
Why you're breaking the rules
He's a midnight gambler
On a highway of fools
But your heart is too cruel
And I'm sitting here crying in my hands
You're a million miles away
He's a midnight gambler
On a highway of fools
Why you're breaking my heart boy
Why you're breaking the rules
He's a midnight gambler
On a highway of fools
But your heart is too cruel
From the highway of fools
We are breaking the rules
He's a midnight gambler
On a highway of fools
Why you're breaking my heart boy
Why you're breaking the rules
But your heart is too cruel
From the highway of fools
We are breaking the rules
He's a midnight gambler
On a highway of fools
Why you're breaking my heart boy
Why you're breaking the rules
He's a midnight gambler
On a highway of fools
But your heart is too cruel
He's a midnight gambler
On a highway of fools
Why you're breaking my heart boy
Heart to heart and face to face
Can you hear my heart beating through the night
A good heart is hard to find
Can you hear my heart beating through the night
Can you feel my heart crying deep inside
You'll never find a love
A love is more than mine
A place where you belong
You wasted days and wasted nights
On your way to paradise
Can you hear my heart beating through the night
You can make it if you try
With your supernova smile
Can you hear my heart beating through the night
Can you feel my heart crying deep inside
A place where you belong
You'll never find a love
A love is more than mine
It will left you higher
We're dancing in shadows
We're dancing in shadows
Friends and strangers
The time is like the right time
From the rest in the skyline
They'll hurt you baby
Heart is broken maybe
Baby come and stop your heart
We're dancing in shadows
We're dancing in shadows
Friends and strangers
We're dancing in shadows
Friends and strangers
Oh I know you are my friend
Feel it stronger every day
Do you wanna break my heart over and over again
In the backseat of your Cadillac
In the backseat of your Cadillac
I want to have my feelings back
Oh kiss me with devotion
What does it take my heart
To win back your love
I'll never tear apart
My baby I'll never get enough
Do you wanna try my heart
In the backseat of your Cadillac
In the backseat of your Cadillac
I want to have my feelings back
Oh kiss me with devotion
In the backseat of your Cadillac
In the backseat of your Cadillac
I want to have my feelings back
Oh kiss me with devotion
In the backseat of your Cadillac
In the backseat of your Cadillac
I want to have my feelings back
Oh kiss me with devotion
Save me just for a sunny day
Young hearts are full of pride
And you never see what's deep inside
Ooh I need that stuff
Ooh I need that stuff
Ooh I need that stuff
I'm in the arms of love
I want to lose control
I never ever touch a man that talks too much
You're so hot in the night
Don't be afraid of me
I'll find my way back home
I never ever touch a man that talks too much
Don't let him get you down
You're so hot in the night
Play that game again and break my heart
If you want just your fun
Miss you so deep tonight
I'm dreaming of a night in Africa
Tell me all the areas.
If you want just your fun
Miss you so deep tonight
You belong to the night
In the night he lives for love
And like the moon he was made for my nights
In a world made of steel
In the night we live for love
If you'll hear oceans beating in my heart
I had too much to dream babe
That's what my baby made for
When girls will stick together
They're talking about boys
What does it take to win your love
Don't wanna be your toy
Come step inside my rainbow
Whenever you're away love
I make it through the night
What does it take to win your love
Oh baby hold me tight
When the love is born
When friends break apart
There's a rainbow in his eyes
And I just can't get enough
Drowning in a sea of love
Take me in your heart tonight
Take me in your heart tonight
Two hearts beat as one
All the days and all the nights
I'm too young for lies doesn't make it right
Why can't we be friends in the shadow of your love
Someone saved my life
I'm running with the night
I'm running my own way
Drowning in a sea of love
Friends and strangers side by side
You wasted days and wasted nights
On the wings of love I'll fly to you
Friends and strangers side by side
You wasted days and wasted nights
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
You've been born again
Another heart you undercover
Friends and strangers side by side
Heaven baby stand the heat
Yes means that you love for ever
You will dance in heavy weather
No means that I'll be so lonely
Hunters baby will survive
You will have a better life
I'm too young to cry my tears
You're the man and I'm your girl
You're playing the game and you play it smart
That you will share with me
Touch a hand and feel the desire
Make a friend and feel the fire
You're the man and I'm your girl
We're to the beats yo and you don't stop
Let's just make your finger rock
Get up into the rhythm mother funky beat
And stop messing around
To the finger that'll ever make your body heat
Party people in the place to be
Rocking to the beat so viciously
Party people in the place to be
Rocking to the beat so viciously
Dancing heart to heart
To your motion of a start
Silent tears are full of pride
Crying tears on telephone
On a point of no return
House of mystic lights
Home is where my heart is
I was looking for my name
House of mystic lights
Nothing but a heartache
Come step inside my heart
Lit me with your shot
Take this change of love
Now I'm high and then I'm low
On a point of no return
We are night birds in the streets

You're a winner with bad souvenirs
You will always be so strong
Hold on tight to your dreams
So hold on to your dreams
All or nothing you can give
Strong enough till the morning light
You're too tough to lose this game
You will always be so strong
Hold on tight to your dreams
So hold on to your dreams
You will always be so strong
Hold on tight to your dreams
Be the prince of ebony
Together we can shine
Don't shoot my sheriff tonight
Don't shoot my sheriff tonight
He belongs to the night
Don't shoot my sheriff tonight
Cocktails at midnight
Reservation for lonely hearts
You're belonging to the dark
Together we can shine
I can feel that it takes me higher
Your heart and break the rules
We are living in a Heartbreak Hotel
I'm feeling there's no love you can save
I'm shooting from my heart
We're living and we're lost without love
We're living in a Heartbreak Hotel
The eyes of a child are weak and wild
We are living in a Heartbreak Hotel
The stars in the sky above
It's strange and sometimes it makes you blue
We are living in a Heartbreak Hotel
I'm feeling there's no love you can save
I'm shooting from my heart

Love will never be the same
It's like a burning fire
He pulls the strings of my deep emotions
It's the night of my burning dream
I never wanna lose you baby
It's like a burning fire
When you're down and feeling blue
Making love for him was fun
He never needed anyone
Be strangers tomorrow
The light is fooling your heart
And lovers tonight inside our hearts
Sometimes be strangers today
Strange are the ways of this world
For your hard times it's too late
Be strangers tomorrow
The light is fooling your heart
And lovers tonight inside our hearts
Sometimes be strangers today
Be strangers tomorrow
Tonight be careful with love
Sometimes be strangers today
I'm looking in your eyes
You might be mine tonight
Spend the night with me
I can feel it everywhere
There's magic in the air
You might be mine tonight
I see heaven in your eyes
Everybody needs someone to love
Be careful in the night
Letters full of tears will tell
You've got no time to lose
Behind the painted smile
Everybody needs some love tonight
Be careful in the night
Letters full of tears will tell
You've got no time to lose
Letters full of tears will tell
You've got no time to lose
Do you love as you look
Nobody does it like you do
All we have is tonight
There is a winner in you
Do you love as you look
You belong into strangers
Do you love as good to look
Do you love as good to look tonight
My heart is an open book
Do you love as good to look tonight
Before the world was made he was a lover

There's magic in the air

I see heaven in your eyes
In your midnight hour
When you're alone and lonely
And in your midnight hour
Can you feel the darkness closing
And you're the lonely one
Face it girl you need him
In your midnight hour
If he stayed the night
Would it be all right
To have a midnight love affair
And he promised you the night
Would you still want him there
And would you feel the same
And do you really care
As long as he is there
In your midnight hour
In your midnight hour
And in your midnight hour
Do your thoughts begin to wander
Do you want to scream
And you're the lonely one
Face it girl you need him
In your midnight hour
If he stayed the night
Would it be all right
To have a midnight love affair
And do you really care
As long as he is there
In your midnight hour
In your midnight hour
When you're all alone
And you feel like crying
And you start thinking
That it don't make sense
How did you get yourself
Into this fine... fine mess
Now you knew he wasn't perfect
And he wasn't the best
But you still wanted him all over the rest
And although he never promised you
You knew in your heart
That he'd be your man
In your midnight hour
If he stayed the night
Would it be all right
To have a midnight love affair
And he promised you the night
Would you still want him there
And would you feel the same
And do you really care
As long as he is there
It makes me feel so good inside
Can you still remember the things we used to say
Won't you please surrender
We're gonna make it right today
A sign of love behind my tears
I'm gonna tell you that I'm misunderstood
I can't believe it you walked away
It makes me feel so good inside
We are strong together
We gonna make it right today
Let's have a big time
I've got this feeling
That you're really getting in to my life
I've got this feeling
That you're really getting in to my life
I'll send my love away
Will you return someday
I'll send my love away
Will you return someday
I've got this feeling
That you're really getting in to my life
I've got this feeling
That you're really getting in to my life
I'll send my love away
Will you return someday
I'll send my love away
Will you return someday
I'll send my love away
Will you return someday
Now I'm sitting here all alone
Hanging on when there's no time
I think that's my warning sign
You're acting strange
Just keep no distance
When I feel your love
There is no resistance
Time won't wait for us
Set up that chain reaction
You gimme what I want
And it better be real
Or the bass drum or the snare you feel
Like all through the night
I'm giving you my loving
You stay on my mind like all the time
I think about you girl when I'm bossing a rhyme
Satisfaction is what I need
You're acting strange
Just keep no distance
When I feel your love
There's no resistance
Time won't wait for us
Set up that chain reaction
I'll give you my loving
When you give me this feeling
Set up that chain reaction
I lie awake here in my bed
Picturing the fight I've had with you
I've hoped you would understand
Never meant to hurt your feelings
Don't meant to ruin your day
But if you thought twice
And you know what you're doing
I won't stand in your way
Don't you know that I'm gonna miss you
Don't you know that I'm gonna miss you
We were friends for all those years
I have shared my fun and tears with you
Gonna get through without you though
Never meant to hurt your feelings
Don't meant to ruin your day
But if you thought twice
And you know what you're doing
I won't stand in your way
Don't you know that I'm gonna miss you
To lose that infatuation
It's a mixed up thing
Stay away from that boy
That isn't love that he's dealing
Fool around with that boy
And you'll feel the hurt that I'm feeling
You'll find a better vocation
It's a mixed up thing
Stay away from that boy
That isn't love that he's dealing
Fool around with that boy
And you'll feel the hurt that I'm feeling
Is not worth crying for
Stay away from that boy
That isn't love that he's dealing
Fool around with that boy
You touch my feelings
And now I'm losing control
And show your feelings
Love is what you want
But you can't catch me
Love is what you want
We played like children
Until the sun goes down
Life has more meaning
Because of what we found
I ask for what I want
Let go of all the pride
And show your feelings
But you can't catch me
Love is what you want
I walked into your life
Something told me that love lay in your eyes
I feel like it's going all wrong
But I never knew love like this before
So say sweet words like you mean them
Don't take this love away now
Don't take this love away now
You have walked out of my life
And you left me with the pain down deep inside
Played around searching for something more
Now you never had love like this before
So say sweet words like you mean them
Don't take this love away now
So say sweet words like you mean them
Don't take this love away now
I like the way you're kissing me
I wasn't sure if you were the one
The one that's gonna stay with me
You and I have taken this decision
To put your love inside of me
Now I know that you are the one
That can not stop caressing me
I'll take you to my hiding place
You and I have taken this decision
You and I have lived with this decision
It feels like heaven in my heart
It feels like heaven in my heart
I walk down the streets of Amsterdam
It feels like heaven in my heart
It feels like heaven in my heart
It feels like heaven in my heart
You can't argue with death
Can't break a burly sailor's neck
You can't drink lava from plastic glasses
And you can't influence the masses
You can't tune a radio to heaven
You can't live seven lives
You can't win money at the horses
And you can't fight the armed forces
You can't sue Buddha for libel
You can't rewrite the Bible
You can't hit homers like Babe Ruth
And can't put your finger on the truth
You can't sing under water
And you can't purify bad blood
You can't argue with death
Can't break a burly sailor's neck
You can't drink lava from plastic glasses
And you can't influence the masses
You can't tune a radio to heaven
You can't live seven lives
You can't win money at the horses
And you can't fight the armed forces
You can't sue Buddha for libel
You can't rewrite the Bible
You can't hit homers like Babe Ruth
And can't put your finger on the truth
You can't sing under water
And you can't purify bad blood
You can't argue with death
Can't break a burly sailor's neck
You can't drink lava from plastic glasses
And you can't influence the masses
You can't tune a radio to heaven
You can't live seven lives
You can't win money at the horses
And you can't fight the armed forces
You can't sue Buddha for libel
You can't rewrite the Bible
You can't hit homers like Babe Ruth
And can't put your finger on the truth
You can't sing under water
And you can't purify bad blood
Flowers don't know me like trees know wind and winds
Blows a breeze one way to snow
I climbed a mountain that night
I peaked at sight of morning light
Word spread so fast in a town like this
Snow only leads to a freeze
Likely to be one this week
Well they don't know me anyway
I climbed a mountain that night
I peaked at sight of morning light
Word spread so fast in a town like this
I climbed a mountain that night
I peaked at sight of morning light
Word spread so fast in a town like this
He's a pleasant meadow
Then he would be the ocean
Using all that he had
On days meant for his parade
On days meant for his parade
On days meant for his parade
On days meant for his parade
That you were my last straw
Of course I'm upset cause
Now I don't have no more
That you were my last straw
You were my last straw
You were my last straw
Your constructive criticism anymore
I can do so much better than this
I took the easy road again
And as for selling myself short
I have become notorious
Oh I know how it goes
This is the part where I realize that I'm alone
You always told me to be mature
Well I just don't know myself anymore
I can do so much better than this
I took the easy road again
And as for selling myself short
I have become notorious
Oh I know how it goes
This is the part where I realize that I'm alone
And everybody wants to fall in love
And everybody wants to fall in love
And everybody wants to fall in love
Everything I left my life for
The door just literally closed
And the person that you chose to be
You left me wide eyed
Seal the deal on you and me
We made it one month till you started pushing
On the part of your life
You really know you shouldn't it
Was clear you regretted coming here with me
You left me closed eyed so I wouldn't see
And soon after I was swallowed by the city and
I had invested all of my trust
It was when you were gonna leave
This heart just wants to go back
You left me wide eyed
Seal the deal on you and me
We made it one month till you started pushing
On the part of your life
You really know you shouldn't it
Was clear you regretted coming here with me
You left me closed eyed so I wouldn't see
And soon after I was swallowed by the city and
I can't take the pain
You said you believed
You just kept getting farther and farther
Away I tried to save you
But it never added up to much
Wish I could make this start
Wish I could make this start
I can't take the pain
Every single day I tried to tell you
But most of the time you never saw yourself
For what you really were
I told you I believed
I believed in everything
Took a look at my life
Then you said my name
And I was yours from that time
You put your hand in mine
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do whoa
Then you said you'd take me away
Take me along with you boy we're on our way
And I'll never need to know if we're gonna make it
I'll count the reasons why
I should count on the day
You'll look in my eyes and say
It just don't feel right
And I'll wipe your eyes
And say baby don't cry
I'm gonna be all right
Then you said you'd take me away
Take me along with you boy we're on our way
And I'll never need to know if we're gonna make it
Then you said you'd take me away
Take me along with you boy we're on our way
And I'll never need to know if we're gonna make it
When I walked out on the first day
All that I could say was hello hello
And when I think about the last thing I thought I wanted
If I didn't want it to
I'm falling on you fast now
And I'm not gonna stop myself
Nothings gonna be held back now
My god I've never seen this coming
I want your lights turned away
Where are we going when you're running
Honey you never wanted this
I'm falling on you fast now
And I'm not gonna stop myself
Nothings gonna be held back now
You're tearing down your world
But honey you're on top of it to everyone
When your waves come crashing down
I'm falling on you fast now
And I'm not gonna stop myself
Nothings gonna be held back now
I'll never catch a shooting star
Or call ya out on who ya really are
I know I'm not the one you wanna win
And I'm surprised we got this far
With that barricade but I want more
I would be a fool to let you let me quit
If I'd ask for one thing
But I know you won't blink
It's safe to say that I still adore you
I'm not the one who started this
And I won't back down
And on the day that you came undone
That day was the last day that I felt home
So I would be a fool to let you let me quit
And it was never about what you were not
But I don't know how much longer I can hold on
Couldn't wait to wake up
And hope that you would stay
I just hoped that you would stay
I can't shake you off of me
That you should be next to me
I don't know why I care
Since you been in my arms
And even though I know
Cause once we opened up
And let them see who we were
Couldn't wait to wake up
And hope that you would stay
I just prayed that you would stay
Cause you don't really love me
And it's apparent every time I come back home
I'm gonna be alone forever
I just need to breathe
I got sunshine in my pocket
Says the smile on my face
It's written on my face
I got my heart tied in my locket
That they're not gonna go to waste
She was just a few years old
Well she only knew one world
And that she was all alone
She only knows of what she's told
It doesn't matter how it stays here
If she keeps running running and running running
In steady pace for now
It doesn't matter how it stays here
If she keeps running running and running running
She'll find her way out
A little beneath those clouds
Well she's watching from the ground
Finally got it all figured out
Got broken and smashed up
And she takes only this with her
It doesn't matter how it stays here
If she keeps running running and running running
In steady pace for now
It doesn't matter how it stays here
If she keeps running running and running running
She'll find her way out
If she falls its exactly what she wanted
The cheap shots from the place that she started
They creep up only when she's feeling right now
She's screaming screaming at the top of her mind
It doesn't matter how it stays here
If she keeps running running and running running
In steady pace for now
It doesn't matter how it stays here
If she keeps running running and running running
She'll find her way out
It's not easy to be this complicated
And I'm more recently jaded
But I can guarantee you'll never hear me say
That's one thing I've decided
It's the only thing that could ever intrigue me
There's no start or end in sight and
I guess I'll have to try it
The pain I'll leave behind me
The sweet imperfections of a hot mess of a girl
And I believe in miracles
But there's no way that I'll
For a girl on her own
I'll try to bargain with myself
I'll tell myself it's really not that bad
And I'll try to stick it out
A little longer in society never killed no one
Away from every problem or severed relationship
Cause that's who I am
Whoever they want on the deep blue sea
And if I followed you home
I checked your phone cause it was beeping
I know you're creeping
Without asking me to go
But if I followed you home
I'm 3 steps from the edge
Don't push me over it
Don't you know don't you know
Every girl is capable of murder
Watch out you don't push me any further any further
You're not the only one walking round with a loaded gun
This little girl is capable of murder
And I followed you home
Throwing sticks and stones
I'm 2 steps from the edge
Don't push me over it
Don't you know don't you know
Every girl is capable of murder
Watch out you don't push me any further any further
You're not the only one walking around with a loaded gun
This little girl is capable of murder
You should never treat a girl like that
Got a good alibi and my bags all packed
You should never treat a girl like that
Every girl is capable of murder
So watch out you don't push me any further
Every girl is capable of murder
Watch out you don't push me any further any further
You're not the only one walking around with a loaded gun
This little girl is capable of murder
This little girl is capable of murder
You know we're so alone wherever we go
Now we're on top of our game
We're one in the same
And I promise we are never going down
We will never go down
We will never go down
And so before you act just consider the fact
Now we're on top of our game
And I promise we are never going down
We will never go down
We will never go down
There's no excuse for letting it pull you under
And I promise we are never going down
We will never go down
We will never go down
That's why we never get along
I can't believe I let you in
But for you somehow it's cool
The combination wasn't great
It's like your mouth was in a race
But your flavor's lost taste
You only call me late at night
As if they don't apply to you
You're just a pretty boy
With such a pretty voice
And all the stupid girls
You're just a pretty boy
With such a pretty voice
And all the stupid girls
I see through all the static and the noise
Your lips are too crusty
I find you disgusting
Could have been The Lion Queen
Could have been the next James Dean
Could have been a mother of three
Could have been Miss America
Could have been a Playboy centerfold
Could have spent my weight in gold
And I'm living the dream and I'm feeling lucky
Chase the one thing that
Could have been an astronaut
Could have been a part time cop
Could have been something I'm not
All that I need is some
Late night TV with some
Yeah Roseanne's in the background laughing with me
Take it from me and get
Chase the one thing that
Chase the one thing that
Must've been a long walk
And then you ran into me
And you made me believe
And every time that we talk
It's like we're taking a walk
Around our own little town
But when we hang up the phone
I gotta put my heart to the test
Gonna wrap it in a bulletproof vest
You'll be running to me
So when the stars come out at night
And we're watching the same sky
You can tell there's no surprise
It's like you fell from outer space
And you can bet your pretty face
You will never be replaced
It's just a matter of time
You know that what's mine is yours
I put it all on the line
And I don't think it's a lie.
This is our bedtime story
That we're gonna tell our kids
While holding all three
So when the stars come out at night
And we're watching the same sky
You can tell there's no surprise
It's like you fell from outer space
And you can bet your pretty face
You will never be replaced
So when the stars come out at night
And we're watching the same sky
You can tell there's no surprise
So when the stars come out at night
And we're watching the same sky
You can tell there's no surprise
It's like you fell from outer space
And you can bet your pretty face
You will never be replaced.
I'm sick of walking on glass on my tiptoes
I don't give a fuck if you don't love me
I don't give a fuck if you don't care
I don't give a fuck if you don't want me
I took a trip into the city last Tuesday
I'm like a love sick puppy begging for a home
Everybody's stepping on me cause my pace is slow
I freeze and break dead weight gotta let it go
Thought I had it figured out back in High School
It freaks me out that I'm not a superhero
But I'm doing fine alone
I don't give a fuck if you don't love me
I don't give a fuck if you don't care
I don't give a fuck if you don't want me
I don't give a fuck if you get lonely
I don't give a fuck if you need me there
I don't give a fuck if you don't love me
I don't give a fuck if you don't love me
I don't give a fuck if you don't care
I don't give a fuck if you don't want me
I don't give a fuck if you get lonely
I don't give a fuck if you need me there
I don't give a fuck if you don't love me
Feels like I don't know anything
I'm a loser in a losing game
I'm patching up my heart again every time it explodes
Wondering if you'll ever come back to me
You know that it was really love actually
Cause losing you is making a mess of me
You know that it was really love actually
Wondering if you'll ever come back to me
You know that it was really love actually
Cause losing you is making a mess of me
You know that it was really love actually
I'm patching up my heart again every time it explodes
Wondering if you'll ever come back to me
You know that it was really love actually
You know that it was love actually
Cause losing you is making a mess of me.
You know that it was really love actually
You know that it was love actually
You told yourself what you wanted to hear
It's a shame you had it all
And these piles of honesty will be kept warm with your regrets
Don't be your worst fear
You can make it if you wanna get out of here
Don't be your worst fear
You can make it if you wanna get out of here
You know you're not even fighting
These piles of honesty will be kept warm with your regrets
Don't be your worst fear
You can make it if you wanna get out of here
Don't be your worst fear
You can make it if you wanna get out of here
Don't be your worst fear
You can make it if you wanna get out of here
Don't be your worst fear
You can make it if you wanna get out of here
Don't be your worst fear
You can make it if you wanna get out of here
Don't be your worst fear
From the stern to the bow
From the hole to the how
From the rudder to the sail
From the wrist to the nail
From the ocean to the bay
From the night to the day
From the stern to the bow
From the nape to the brow
From the east to the west
My little grasshopper airplane
I find you so far from my side
I'm lost in my old in my own green light
Just let me say who am I
Her big white plastic finger
But it's not your unknown right hand
But it's not your unknown right hand
Just let me say who am I
South America's my name
My little grasshopper airplane
One day I had to leave my country
Calm beach and palm tree
That day I couldn't even cry
And I forgot that outside there would be other men
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
The day Carmen Miranda died
They put a photograph in the magazine
Her dead mouth with red lipstick smiled
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
One morning they came to take me to jail
But alone in that same night
I cried and cried again
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
One night I saw a Mexican film
She opened her arms and got two bullets
And died sweetly without a sigh
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
One day I went down to the underground
But I missed the last train
And now that I'm just looking around
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
Little more blue than then
Little more blue than then
I feel a little more blue than then
I cross the streets without fear
Everybody keeps the way clear
I know they keep the way clear
I am lonely in London without fear
While my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
While my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
And people hurry on so peacefully
A group approaches a policeman
He seems so pleased to please them
And it's so good to live in peace
While my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
While my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
God bless silent pain and happiness
God bless silent pain and happiness
But my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
Everybody knows that our cities were built to be destroyed
Everybody knows that our cities were built to be destroyed
You hide behind the mat
But I know she was born to do everything wrong with all of that
But I know she was born to do everything wrong with all of that
I wish to know things are getting better
Please send me a letter
I wish to know things are getting better
She has given her soul to the devil but the devil gave his soul to God
She has given her soul to the devil but the devil gave his soul to God
She has given her soul to the devil and bought a flat by the sea
She has given her soul to the devil and bought a flat by the sea
I wish to know things are getting better
Please send me a letter
I wish to know things are getting better
Everybody knows that it's so hard to dig and get to the root
Everybody knows that it's so hard to dig and get to the root
You wake up on your bed
I wish to know things are getting better
Please send me a letter
If you feel the weight
But if you hold the stone
If you feel the weight
If you feel the weight
Shoot me dead or be good or
Shoot me dead or say that you die for me
Don't waste your time in saying
Don't waste your time in looking for sorrow
I'm as sure of the past as
I'm certain about tomorrow
All I know about you is
All you know about me is misinformation
All we know about death is
All we know about life in the situation
You're eyes try to detect what
You're eyes try to detect in explanations
My eyes are blinded by
The far off look of new expectations
In the hot sun of a Christmas Day
But they won't find me
In the hot sun of a Christmas Day
In the hot sun of a Christmas Day
In the hot sun of a Christmas Day
In the hot sun of a Christmas Day
In the hot sun of a Christmas Day
In the hot sun of a Christmas Day
They killed someone else
Bet you'll never get to know me
You don't know me at all
The world is spinning round slowly
There's nothing you can show me
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Bet you'll never get to know me
You don't know me at all
The world is spinning round slowly
There's nothing you can show me
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Bet you'll never get to know me
You don't know me at all
The world is spinning round slowly
There's nothing you can show me
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
The age of music is past
Expect the final blast
Feel the sound of music banging in my belly
Know that one day I must die
Nine out of ten movie stars make me cry
And nine out of ten film stars make me cry
You know we ain't that strong
I hear my voice among others
I'm in the silence that's suddenly heard
After the passing of a car
I'm in the silence that's suddenly heard
After the passing of a car
I'm in the silence that's suddenly heard
After the passing of a car
Spaces grow wide about me
Spaces grow wide about me
If you look from your window at the morning star
You'll only see that you can't see very far
And my eyes swept the horizon
You sing about waking up in the morning
But you're never up before noon
You look completely different from those straights
Who walked around on the moon
But you'll realize pretty soon
That's all that you care
Isn't worth a twelve bar tune
You won't believe you're just one more flower
Among so many flowers that sprout
Where a wedding has been
Wearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door
All the lonely people
All the lonely people
That no one will hear
When there's nobody there
All the lonely people
All the lonely people
And was buried along with her name
As he walks from the grave
All the lonely people
All the lonely people
Where a wedding has been
Wearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door
All the lonely people
All the lonely people
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
And yet you don't believe her
When she says her love is dead
You think she needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
She says that long ago she knew someone but now
There will be times when all the things she said
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
She says that long ago she knew someone but now
There will be times when all the things she said
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one
Children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
Listen to the music playing in your head
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
Children at your feet
You know I need someone
But now these days are gone
And now I find I've changed my mind
And opened up the doors
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being around
Help me get my feet back on the ground
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
And every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being around
Help me get my feet back on the ground
But now these days are gone
And now I find I've changed my mind
And opened up the doors
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being around
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Everybody knows that our cities were built to be destroyed

Cinema transcendental
The age of music is past
Expect the final blast
Feel the sound of music banging in my belly
Know that one day I must die
Nine out of ten movie stars make me cry
And nine out of ten film stars make me cry
I can see your white face
Hope you can hear my tune
Why didn't you stop her
Don't you know I suffer
And you'll watch me cry soon
Glow through the pollution
I'll wait on the high dune
A very strange enchanted boy
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Cinema transcendental
She's more like a beauty queen
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
That dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
She told my baby that's a threat
Then showed a photo of a baby cries
Go on dance on the floor in the around baby
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Before it's too late my love
Why not retire to a farm
And be contented to charm
The birds off the trees
I care for you much too much
The thrill when we meet is so bittersweet
So on your mark get set
Time is as weak as water
I'm kneeling on the shore
Lips so red world so wide
Time is as weak as water
I taught myself a lesson
I put myself to sleep
Standing on the waters casting your bread
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
Freedom just around the corner for you
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within.
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
Take the motherless children off the street
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
You know I need someone
But now these days are gone
And now I find I've changed my mind
And opened up the doors
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being around
Help me get my feet back on the ground
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
And every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being around
Help me get my feet back on the ground
But now these days are gone
And now I find I've changed my mind
And opened up the doors
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being around
Help me get my feet back on the ground

There may be trouble ahead
So while there's music and moonlight and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance
Before the fiddlers have fled
Before they ask us to pay the bill and while we still have the chance
Let's face the music and dance
There may be teardrops to shed
So while there's moonlight and music and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance... dance
Let's face the music and dance...
There may be teardrops to shed
So while there's moonlight and music and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance... dance
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm
It has a meter that is tricky
But when you dance it with a new love
There's a true love in her eyes
It's theme is a kiss and a sight
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye
Two arms around you and lips that sigh
You'll never care to do the polka
And when you dance it with a new love
There'll be true love just for you
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye
When music lights are gone and we're saying goodbye
The stars fill the sky
So in lobe whit you am I
My arms fold about you
So in love with you am I
In love with the night mysterious
The night when you first were there
In love with my joy delirious
When I knew that you could care
So in love... So in love...
I can't tell if it's cloudy or bright
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying
Suicide remarks are torn
That he not busy being born is busy dying
Temptation's page flies out the door
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying
So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Make everything from toy guns that spark
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred
While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked
And though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
Advertising signs that con
You into thinking you are the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you
A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer to fit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it's not he or she or them or it that you belong to
Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
Old lady judges watch people in pairs
While them that defend what they cannot see
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
At pettiness which plays so rough
Kick my legs to crash it off
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
My heart is sad and lonely
I'm all for you body and soul
I spend my days in longing
It's me you're wronging
I'm all for you body and soul
It's hard to conceive it
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have one more chance to prove
My life's a wreck you're making
You know that I'm yours
Myself to you body and soul
A very strange enchanted boy
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Someday he'll come along
And he'll be big and strong
I'll do my best to make him stay
He'll look at me and smile
And in a little while
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word
Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Will be my good news day
He'll build a little home
And so all else above
There will be many other nights like this
And I'll be standing here with someone new
There will be other songs to sing
Another fall... another spring...
But there will never be another you
There will be other lips that I may kiss
But they won't thrill me
Like yours used to do
But how can they come true
And I'll be standing here with someone new
There will be other songs to sing
Another fall... another spring...
But there will never be another you
There will be other lips that I may kiss
But they won't thrill me
Like yours used to do
But how can they come true
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
Something here inside
They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
Now laughing friends deride
When a lovely flame dies
I'm so young and you're so old
I don't care just what they say
You and I will be as free
As the birds up in the trees
Thrills I get when you hold me close
I love you but do you love me
I love you with all my heart
And I hope we will never part
Tell me that there is no other
I love you with my heart
Only you can take my heart
Only you can tear it apart
When you hold me in your loving arms
I can feel you giving all your charms
Squeeze me baby with all your might
They say into your early life romance came
And in this heart of yours burnt a flame
A flame that flickered one day and died away
You learned that fools in love soon grow wise
The years have changed you somehow
Never thinking of tomorrow
With some man in a restaurant
Is that all you really want
You miss the love you had long ago
And when nobody is nigh
Take a rest as a friend as an old memory.
And I swear that I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun
Trying to forget my feelings of love.
Trying to forget my feelings of love.
And feelings like I've never have you again in my heart.
And feelings like I've never have you again in my life.
Summertime the weather is easy.
And the cotton is high
One of these mornings
Then you're spread your wings
And you'll take to the sky
That ain't nothing can be and you
Please daddy and mammy
Just two points of contact
I don't have too much detachment
I'm too blond for y'all
Down the way where the nights are gay
And the sun shines daily on the mountaintop
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town
Down at the market you can hear
Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear
And the rum is fine any time of year
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town
Sounds of laughter every where
And the dancing girls swaying to and fro
I must declare my heart is there
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town
Down the way where the nights are gay
And the sun shines daily on the mountaintop
I look a trip on a sailing ship
Jamaica I made a stop
But I'm said to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
Let the poets pipe of love
I know every type of love
Better far than they.
Every love but true love
If you want to buy my wares.
Follow me and climb the stairs
Now you say you're lonely
I cried a river over you
Now you say you're sorry
I cried a river over you
While you never shed a tear
Told me you were through with me and
Now you say you love me
Come on and cry me a river
Like the sun that always shines
Like the poets in this rhyme
Like the galaxies in time
Like the day that never fails
Like on seashores there are shells
Like the time that always tells
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst
As making sure we dress in style
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst
Like the lifetime of the sun
It will leave no heart undone
Perhaps I had a wicked childhood
Perhaps I had a miserable youth
But somewhere in my wicked
There must have been a moment of truth
Whether or not you should
So somewhere in my youth or childhood
I must have done something good
Nothing comes from nothing
So somewhere in my youth or childhood
Sometimes I wonder why I spend
That melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song
Where stars are bright
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
Nothing but blue skies
Nothing but bluebirds
Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Nothing but blue skies
The age of music is past
Expect the final blast
Feel the sound of music banging in my belly
Know that one day I must die
Nine out of ten movie stars make me cry
And nine out of ten film stars make me cry
I cross the streets without fear
Everybody keeps the way clear
I know they keep the way clear
I am lonely in London without fear
While my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
While my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
And people hurry on so peacefully
A group approaches a policeman
He seems so pleased to please them
And it's so good to live in peace
While my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
While my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
God bless silent pain and happiness
God bless silent pain and happiness
But my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the sky
Bet you'll never get to know me
You don't know me at all
The world is spinning round slowly
There's nothing you can show me
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Bet you'll never get to know me
You don't know me at all
The world is spinning round slowly
There's nothing you can show me
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Bet you'll never get to know me
You don't know me at all
The world is spinning round slowly
There's nothing you can show me
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Show me from behind the wall
Everybody knows that our cities were built to be destroyed
Everybody knows that our cities were built to be destroyed
You hide behind the mat
But I know she was born to do everything wrong with all of that
But I know she was born to do everything wrong with all of that
I wish to know things are getting better
Please send me a letter
I wish to know things are getting better
She has given her soul to the devil but the devil gave his soul to God
She has given her soul to the devil but the devil gave his soul to God
She has given her soul to the devil and bought a flat by the sea
She has given her soul to the devil and bought a flat by the sea
I wish to know things are getting better
Please send me a letter
I wish to know things are getting better
Everybody knows that it's so hard to dig and get to the root
Everybody knows that it's so hard to dig and get to the root
You wake up on your bed
I wish to know things are getting better
Please send me a letter
And the taste of each flower is sweet
So why do the say she's a bad girl
She lives in the dark
She's living in a dreamworld
And she's caught by the tail
She's living in a dreamworld
And she's caught by the tail
And the taste of each flower is sweet
So why do they say she's a bad girl
Take away that hurting feeling
Wash away that hurting feeling
When she no longer needs you.
She no longer needs you.
A love that should have lasted years.
You think she needs you.
A love that should have lasted years.
I wanted to show my gratitude
And to set it up for you
A moment that would open true
I wanted to show my gratitude
In places you won't let me see
Thought you turn inside out at will
I wanted to show my gratitude
For the way you reflect me
All of me arms and face
Better then the mirror
In my solitude my restless gratitude
I'm reckless within sight of you
And in my gratitude I might
Make to much noise for you
In my gratitude I sometimes need
The spectacle of failure
And in my gratitude all of life
In my gratitude to die for you
The man wrinkles his face
But it's already worn
And the shirt is torn
Where do you come from
Is it the way the sun hits my face
Or is it your memory which I cannot trace
And the church bell dongs
And I swallow the salt
The woman she laughs as I pass her by
Where do you come from
Is it the way the sun
Or is it your memory which I cannot trace
Look at me I have so much pride
I took my shoes off I ran I did not hide
Look at me I Have so much pride
I will give my dowry for the prize
And minds of every kind of universe
Though you treat me cruel
I will always treat you as my sweet heart
No matter what you do
I'm so in love with you
Though you treat me cruel
Though you treat me cruel
I will always treat you as my sweet heart
No matter what you do
It all just happens again
There is a chain that's never broken
You know the story it's sad but true
An angry man gets drunk and beats his kids
The same old way his drunken father did
What comes around well it goes around
It all just happens again
At 17 Shannon is pregnant
As young as her mom when she had her
Her kid is never gonna have a dad
The same old way that Shannon never had
What comes around well it goes around
It all just happens again
And all the things you learn when you're a kid
You'll fuck up just like your parents did
It all just happens again
And welfare moms have kids on welfare
And fat parents they have fat kids too
You know it's never gonna end
The same old cycle's gonna start again
7 yrs old and she's already flying
Hanging from an old oak tree on a tire swing
She wants to see what's on the other side
She wants to run as far and as fast as she can
Keep your head in the highest cloud
Don't think you ever gonna come back down
Chase the stars till you find what your looking for
People gonna say what they gonna say
Honey you just dream away
Can't believe that she's already driving
You can be what ya wanna be baby
So if you wanna see the other side
Of this great be world
Follow the heart of that little girl
Keep your head in the highest cloud
Don't think you ever gonna come back down
Chase the star till you find what you find what your looking for
People gonna say what they gonna say
Honey you just dream away
Keep your head in the highest cloud
Don't think you ever gonna come back down
Chase the star till you find what your looking for
People gonna say what they gonna say
They're gonna say what they're gonna say
People gonna say what they gonna say
Honey you just dream away
I tried to find you at the bottom of a bottle
Laying down on the bathroom floor
My loneliness was a rattle in the windows
You said you don't want me anymore
Feeling like a fool for trying
I don't even remember why I'm wasting all these tears on you
I wish I could erase our memory
Cause you didn't give a damn about me
Wasting all these tears on you
You ain't worth another sleepless night
And I'll do everything I gotta do to get you off my mind
Standing on a corner crying
Feeling like a fool for trying
I don't even remember why I'm wasting all these tears on you
I wish I could erase our memory
Cause you didn't give a damn about me
Wasting all these tears on you
Standing on a corner crying
Feeling like a fool for trying
I don't even remember why I'm wasting all these tears on you
I wish I could erase our memory
Cause you didn't give a damn about me
Wasting all these tears on you
I tried to find you at the bottom of a bottle
I'm the kind of girl you can take home to your mama
I'm the kind of girl that can hang out with your friends
I can hold my own with a beer or two
I'm a lighthouse throwing caution to the wind
I am wild flowers and holey sweaters
Hard candy and vinyl records
Saturday night and a Bible verse or two
I'm a weeping willow when you're mad at me
There's nothing I can't do
As long as I am everything to you
And sometimes I make you laugh until you cry
I'm a firework in the pouring rain
I call in sick on a sunny day
Backyard moonlight dancing kind of high
I am wild flowers and holey sweaters
Hard candy and vinyl records
Saturday night and a Bible verse or two
I'm a weeping willow when you're mad at me
There's nothing I can't do
As long as I am everything to you
Don't have to be thing else
Wild flowers and holey sweaters
Hard candy and vinyl records
Saturday night and a Bible verse or two
I'm tough as concrete when you need me to be
I'm a weeping willow when you're mad at me
Oh as long as I am everything to you
I make my bed and I make mistakes
Now people gonna say what they gonna say
But I'm strong enough to light it up and blow it away
Shake it right off and put my lipstick on yeah
I ain't breaking no laws
I ain't hurting any one
And it's good to knowing
I don't need no body to hold my hand
Oh Keeping up with me is gonna take a grown man
I can walk in to a bad and order a shot
I can go home early or stay all night
Ain't no one gonna tell me if that's all right
I ain't breaking no laws
I ain't hurting any one
And it's good knowing
I don't need no body holding my hand
You can take me in your arms
And you can call me Baby.
I ain't breaking no laws
I ain't hurting any one
And it's good knowing
I don't need no body holding my hand
Oh keeping up with me Honey
Keeping up with me is gonna take a grown man
A red river of wine won't drown you
No amount of time could wash you away
No holy prayer is gonna save me
This love affair is like a shallow grave
And time after time I let you defeat me
Red river of wine won't drown you
All my lovers before you
Were whole mess of crazy
All my lovers before you
Could not quite save me
Till I saw you walking through the door
I'm gonna love you forever
That I almost gave up on lovers.
And I'm gonna love you forever
And I've been touched
Sure is hard to remember
Life before you walked in the picture
I was a sad Mona Lisa with a crooked frame
Searching with no end in sight
Before you called me baby
Before you looked me in the eyes
I had nothing left to save me
Before you called me baby
It's the down and the lights turned on
And the band started playing a different song
I was baptized by the fire in your kiss
Before you called me baby
Before you looked me in the eyes
I had nothing left to save me
Before you called me baby
Before you called me baby
On this lonely heart in my chest
Before you called me baby
Before you looked me in the eyes
I had nothing left to save me
Every time that I smoke cigarettes
The taste of the smoke rolling off my lips
Reminds me of how you beg me to quit
And I still haven't quit
Every time that I order my coffee black
Your memory keeps coming back
I think about you all damn night
I think about you all damn day
I think about you driving around in the same little town
And going on without me baby
I wonder if you're happy now
If you're ever gonna be
I've been living my life on the frustrated side
I've been doing my best just to shake it off
But you keep weaving in and out of my thoughts
I think about you all damn day
I think about you driving around in the same little town
And going on without me baby
I wonder if you're happy now
If you're ever gonna be
I think about you all damn night
Driving around in the same little town
Going on without me baby
I wonder if you're happy now
If you're ever gonna be
With the universe around me waiting for me to fall down
Your words are like a whiskey river rolling off of your tongue
This feeling is dancing in my flames
Throw me and I'll just burn brighter
No matter what you say
I'm not spinning on this planet just for me to make you smile
This feeling is dancing in my flames
Throw me and I'll just burn brighter
No matter what you say
This feeling is dancing in my flames
Throw me and I'll just burn brighter
No matter what you say
And I said it's cruel that I feel bad that if I could I promise that I'd take it all back
You said that you didn't give a damn about the money or the fame if it's gonna change us
Too busy drinking on the company tab
I scream my lungs out
You're steel guitars and broken hearts have done me in
This town is killing me
This town is killing me
And I can't take that one back
And I pushed him away and the price I pay is a whole lot of lonely nights
And a whole lot of songs that never see the light
You're steel guitars and broken hearts have done me in
This town is killing me
This town is killing me
This town is killing me
Even though you're killing me
This town is killing me
Words fall out my mouth
To pack up my bags and walk right out the door
I'll roll the windows down
Don't know where I'm going
I just know I can't stay
Might make it to Memphis
But that ain't far enough
So fast that the hurt can't catch up
I'm burning your memory
All the way to Tacoma
By then I hope you're out of my mind
With a truck stop song and a cold cup of coffee
And I'm hurting like hell
But honey how could I not be
Oh the joke and the fool
The last one to know so I'm gonna put
Mountains and deserts and rivers between us
Go as far as I can go
Might make it to Memphis
But that ain't far enough
So fast that the hurt can't catch up
I'm burning your memory
All the way to Tacoma
By then I hope you're out of my mind
Might be some tears in Topeka
A couple of sleepless nights in Cheyenne
And the time I miss you
I'll hit the gas as fast as I can
Might make it to Memphis
Past the Kansas City line
All the way to Tacoma
By then I hope you're out of my mind
All the way to Tacoma
Holding up the end of the bar
I've seen him in this place before
Of every Hefner in the room
And maybe it's just me or is everybody in here
Or is it just another scene from a corner booth at closing time
There's a cellphone man with his tie on the table
Then the door flies open and the breeze blows and then I can see her
And maybe it's just me or is everybody in here
Or is it just another scene from a corner booth at closing time
Maybe it's just me or is everybody in here
Or is it just another scene from a corner booth at closing time
And the bartender stacks the chairs
If you come any closer
You're gonna have to take my keys away
And I swear that I haven't drank a drop
But this buzz won't stop
I haven't even touched your skin
Haven't even had your kiss
And I'm already feeling like this
You give me that contact high when I look in your eyes
I don't need pills or wine when I'm close to you
I was just in the room
To hold back the flow of that dance
You give me that contact high when I look in your eyes
I don't need pills or wine when I'm close to you
I was just in the room
Watch me if you come a little closer
I dare you to come a little closer
Watch me if you come a little closer
I dare you to come a little closer
Gimme that contact high when I look in your eyes
I don't need pills or wine when I'm close to you
I was just in the room
You can cut this tension with a knife
Watch me if you come a little closer
I dare you to come a little closer
Watch me if you come a little closer
I dare you to come a little closer
I've been praying asking God for help
I've been waiting for life to get better
And I'm just spinning on a pavement being told to dance
Why it always falls apart
Why it always crown to see the star
Care for my fragile heart
We're all living in a house of cards
And I still miss you and don't want you back
Why it always falls apart
Why it always crown to see the stars
Care for my fragile heart
Care for my fragile heart
I couldn't think of a better way to spend my Friday night
Think about the loving will make
Think of all the money we'll save
I'll be your cheap date
Think about the loving will make
Think of all the money we'll save
I'll be your cheap date
Come a little closer baby
Let me be your cheap date
Think about the loving will make
Think of all the money we'll save
And I sing loud into the rain.
And I fall into your arms again.
For you've made this picture I live in.
And the stars sing to you with their own melody.
You alone have made me whole...
You've made me beautiful.
It took me so long to figure out you were real.
My misconception led me to do what I feel.
When it's promises were made and broken.
And I know now that only you give life to me.
My life is so different now that you're in control.
You've shown me that there is only one way.
And I know now that only you give life to me.
It took me so long...
It took me so long...
Your love rains from heaven.
Your song falls from heaven.
Your spirit fills me up.
And hold me once again.
For you are what I need.
Please tell me I'm your friend.
I'm farther away then I'd planned.
When I've fallen it's so hard to stand.
To you I can't seem to hold on.
And fill these empty hands.
Embraced within your love.
In your spirit I will dance.
I have this dream to stand on top a mountain.
To spread my wings and let the wind steal me.
And they will never come true.
And no one holds me down.
And show them that they're wrong.
If high enough I fly... away.
I have this wish to dance around the stars.
To be so high up that I can't barely breathe.
And they will never come true.
I'll fly until my song is heard.
Yeah and I found you.
The one who's words of hope has seen me through.
Yeah and I found you.
I found you chasing after me. You were running with your arms wide open. Saying I am all you need. Yeah my love is everlasting.
Yeah and I found you.
The one who's words of hope has seen me through.
Yeah and I found you.
So glad that I fell into your life.
I fell down and landed by your side.
You have shown me just the way it feels to be loved.
You are the reason I wake up every day.
And I really don't care what other people say.
You have shown me just the way it feels to be loved.
You've caught me and I don't know how.
There seems to be just no way out.
Yes I'm falling in love with you.
You've swept me off my feet and you have made my life complete.
You have shown me just the way it feels to be loved.
You've been the mirror to my smile.
Can't believe you've loved me all the while.
An open door that looks so freeing.
Looks like I can find a way out.
I'm so glad that I saw your face.
And I'm so glad that I heard your name.
The paint is cracking and it's peeling.
And becoming some one else.
Cause it hurts too much.
Dry them with your touch.
What I really need is to hear your voice.
To these hands held high.
Revive my heart and make me yours.
What I need is you...
And you're down for the count
You are dancing with men going around and around
That your spine will dissolve
You will fall to the floor
You will take what you need
And the headaches will come
But at least you can breathe
There's the smoke fills your lungs
We will wait for the day
We'll rejoice when it comes
The snow was on the ground
You opened books and peeked inside
They kissed you on your crown
With pins in your fingers
You held yourself up high
The picture peeled the person
They let themselves divide
You arrive at the place
It is not what you want
But it is what you chase
So you don't have to hold
All of the candles that burn on their own
You will steal all the smells
That cut through your nose and excite all your cells
When it's time to escape
You realize you've waited until it's too late
But your birthday inflated
The bones with which you creak
They stole your shoes and then brought you to
The caverns of their teeth
Your soul ripped from your stomach
You gave an awful cry
Will you use my spine
To swing from tree to tree in search of
There's no broken bones
She will glow when she has grown into the sea that shows her gates
The water shall refill the empty space
Oh he has savored carcasses that lie like lovers in his home
We will sleep in bags that hang along these rows
We will sit in fields of oranges and graves
But I hang her in my heart
And when the light beams through the porch then we will know
Sleeping silent to disrupt the fallen snow
And in your room I saw that you had grown
Your cotton sheets did lift you by the throat
I split the numbers indeed
I held my arms outstretched
I cut through brothers in need
To be the curtain for the act that you have left here on repeat
Don't forget to crease the pages when you leave
And when the water is as cold as it is deep
We will burn the barns where babes first took to speech
And under beds of water
There will lie my eldest daughter
She has drifted and the sea has held her body from decay
And the world she wouldn't let it
And the sky stems from the ocean
I'm a fiery gal looking out for my man
Gotta tell you I've got nothing left
My toes are frozen but I love this town to death
I just can't remember mouth shapes
Or the way that your eyes
Stab at that empty space
Hold my hand and I will hold you up
I've got lots of pills and I like to eat them up
A stranger told me I'm his one true love
What's the use of trying to find us
If you know damn well
You're just gonna give this up
Well you can take your teeth
Well you're contagious and I got no light
You showed me constellations in the grass one night
I would smile but I got no cash
I like an empty bottle and a Jesus on my dash
I just can't remember your movements
Just sometimes I feel
Bet he's holding the home
When you open those books
Big Ships is meant for...
Maybe I'm meant for the sea
It's there swinging from my family tree
Starting to breathe so heavily
Grandpa telling me of his days in the navy
I was alive for a moment you see
He was there when I woke
He was there when I woke
Maybe I'm meant for the sea
It's there swinging from my family tree
Maybe I'm meant for the sea
Grandpa Albert had it made for me
Maybe I'm meant for the sea
We pass it by so passively
And all that's said is what we know
That we're not meant for history
Maybe I'm meant for the sea
It's there swinging from my family tree
Maybe I'm meant for the sea
We've attacked and we're waiting to eat
We are not sure what it is that you say
Ships as the night turns to day
And we're starved and we're parched
We'll rip into the flesh atop the spines with which we arch
And we'll turn all the runs in our stockings to webs
We'll hoist them in the forest
All the clouds are laughing at their lemon lace
They were birthed without a face
Don't sing soft it's what they want
They will turn your stomach into shards
Amongst the hogs stuck in the yard
And when they say they've had enough
They'll take the flowers from the dust
And drop the orchids on your old age
The stars as they start to go out
One by one you will line them all up
To all those who've not given up
And we laugh when you choke
We will drag you to the desert
So you're burnt and you're broke
And your wife will draw straws
For the next on the list
One by one but quickly
The stars they still exist
It's exactly this that drives us to be mad
We're not quite sure what we've had
You won't want to miss this part
We'll slip into our hunting hats and wait
Around the house and when we pray
We'll ask for mercy for our sins
And all the things we never did alone
I wait for my husband to get home
And when the cops ask me the reason
I will say I don't really know
And I love to feel your fingers up my skirt
And I love to feel your fingers up my skirt
In the desert we will dirty our hands till they're clean
And like a February's corpse we froze
And we were among those
Far from the Holy Ghost.
And when the Body was received I shrieked.
We are the sanest bunch.
And every time we have to Part
I sit and shoot the doves in my back yard
I dig a hole in search of kites
I lose my grip oh how that string it bites
And the dogs they dip my feet
They make me watch the girls the dancing queens
I am not the one to blame
I am not the horse in this here game
Hot with disease an untimely demise
I'm still watching the world through your eyes
Your insides were never my size
It's not enough to give.
You gotta know I'm still alive.
Just to know I'm still alive.
You gotta know I'm still alive.
Destroy your Mr. Right.
But he says he's not there.
But I'll see you out there.
Come and get me out of this town oh now
Come and rescue me from this joint hotel full of bones and babies
Take a look at yourself
A look that will sell
Call your aunt about the tea she abandoned
It's the same as any day now
Except your teeth are falling out and you're going upstairs
It's an upstairs harmony
And when you get there you can write a song to keep you company
There are good things
There are no things to eat
And tonight we're eating meat
There's a couple of things
I should tell you about
That the fuckers wouldn't sell
It's the men who feed on human beings
With their bellies hanging out
You can wash their fingers
You can bite your tongue
And when you're ready to go
They'll pinch at your sides
And they'll make you recite
Brilliant songs about the symphony
And I hate their trees
And their white houses
And goddamn white teeth
And the chemical stress on the hair that they squeeze
And the brats that they breed
And the air that they breathe
Well then they ate me
Baby said when the poison's in the river
I wanted to chew on this
I wanted to trace your list
These days we are too rough and
We walked in black and blue black and blue
Baby said when the carpet gets the better
We will know know the same
When you are not too sturdy
When you are not too dusty
I'll grant you right to touch me
Why I'm counting I don't know
Perhaps my markings show
Until I can't see over balconies
The mariners are good to me
They bring me honey goo
And my arms are sleeping
So let us breathe in deep
And the lock is not forgotten
No the lock does not devour souls
Her arms may fall off
And when this hole dries
We'll shut both our eyes
For in my heart I am trying to lie
Lie still as I wake you up
Her grandmother sleeps in the bedroom now
And you never loved me
That's just how you struck me
And you never loved me
That's just how you struck me
And I'm not going to wait
For the sun to pick me up at night
Do as good bears should
I climbed hills of chimneys tall like butter
Tall like caverns in my teeth
And when I came to I did shutter
We were trying to believe
And when the day has ended
And when our hearts unfold
We'll glow like the night sky oh
With both hands on my throat
I've got grace on my mind
And I'm holding on this time
It's a treat to both these eyes
I was wasted on the trigger
In the river I was waiting
What I could not yet become
Let's remember all the good
This is nothing like my home
On the table I was ready
Running wild after chalice
Just to let them take me on
See the whirling of the sky lights
Trains pull out from under mantles
Just to listen with us all
And with colors captivating
Eleanor stood cold and waiting
She was bathing me in blessings
That confronted as I cried
See the whole of me igniting
Clever hands with brushes biting
Cross the river to the town
With the names of every sacrifice inside
Oh my precious demon darlings
I'll remove me to the chambers
Where I know I'll feel alive
Dance in circles atop grasses
In the places of our reaches
Where the beasts had set their lives
But the water ceased to bargain
We are stranded where we've landed
Take us back to where
We feel we need to be
Watching careful the completion
Of the cosmos where the shy glow
Sleeping sound now that I've
Found my dearest friend outside my door
Bound for new life making thunder
Found the home of drag race runners
Comfort flaring in my sheets
Where the kids are seldom honest
Cross the borders past the train yards
I will enter just to breathe.
We will cradle one another
We will wander past the distance
I let my hands get caught
Well I cannot play again
When do you ask me if
I see it when we dance
And make a pouters portrait
But there is just one more question
It must be time this weather can't be right
We rode our horses to the outer edge
And we became the people
We have never meant to be
The pieces we did not want to receive
And when you come home from your dinners
And when I cut the lines within my hands
And when your gal decides she's on her own
You'll rethink your romance
You never want to care for
Anyway you're taking down that fence
But when you come home to the kitchen
I am waiting at the sink
My salty fingers ride across the cupboard
Drenching it with skin
Of the faithless brats
Who bit their tongues
To scare their onward sons
And in the trees they built their
Truths and meaningless machines
That froze beneath the snow
Wont you come with me
Wont you come with me
Got a motor to run and ride
Well take a look at it kids
And take a look at your daddy's eyes
Well god damn this man
He is the savior of this empty life
Well there's a locket in my pocket
And it's keeping Satan on my side
I'm not the sound of the dawn
When your knocking on that deed
Burdened of the man inside her dreams
When you're coming to bed
You better buckle up your old disease
There's a ceasing that will make me sneeze
This time it's the martyrs that eat at me
Well there's a locket in my pocket
And it's keeping me from being free
I'm not the ground of the sun
That your walking on that heed
Oh and open up your eyes park ranger
I cannot afford the price to heed
Oh and yes I found the sweetest mother
Found yourself a serpent this day
Flames are spitting sore from
His tongue and his eyes
Thirsting for the fruits we have dried
Pluck yourself an eye lash and
Pray that your bones will rise
Got gin in your belly
As something was wrong from the start
I carry your bones in my heart
Riding on horseback he came
Told me there was no one to blame
I was all the while clenching
The omen you gave to me
And the skies of white ember
You told me to run from
Temptations of grandeur that
Come with the visions of him
Running through fields
In the house near the grain
High like the noontime
Your eyes were all wild
Your lips took to mine
You grabbed me and tugged
At my soul through your own
We'd go down to the river
You'd cleanse what was left of me
The sun turned to ash
And your body was withered
Your bones are let go
You see my candle's lit
Innocence won't save me
All you southern lady
Keep your head on tight
And all your sinner's babies
Keep your engines right
You make a devil proud
You make a devil proud
You make a devil proud
You got bottles of babes
Under your arms and in the
Arcade it's a sticky cloud
It's a sticky cloud and
It's making the world go round
Know just when to fake it
Well you can open wide
Keep your kernels naked
We can spin him round
And around and around
I see without a sound
Now you're done with us
And they're black and they're black
My skin is in the sack
You've got the eyes that make the water rushing river run
No one knows what I mean
When I cannot see if you are in charge of me
When it comes to my faith
I could live with everyday
I've got monsters inside of me
And when they eat at my veins
I can feel them just stain my face
I know people will laugh at me
When you're down for the count
You are dancing with men going round and around
And your scared and your sure
That your spine will dissolve you will fall to the floor
You will take what you need
And the headaches will come but at least you can breathe
There's the smoke fills your lungs
We will wait for the day will rejoice when it comes
On your birthday you woke up
The snow was on the ground
You opened books and peaked inside
They kissed you on your crown
With pins in your fingers
You held yourself up high
The picture peeled the person
They let themselves divide
You arrive at the place
It is not what you want
So you don't have to hold
All of the candles that burn on their own
You will steal all the smells
That cut through your nose and excite all your cells
When its time to escape
You realize you waited until it's too late
Your birthday inflated the bones with which your creep
They stole your shoes and brought you to the caverns of your teeth
To swing from tree to tree in search of places pleasing to the eye
I said I'm sorry dear
I said I'm sorry dear
All these bottled up emotions
Feelings never felt before
Gotta find a way outside
But nothing seems too open
Go away so I can see you near me
Near enough so I can see you fly
I hope you understand me
But I know you never will
The wind was blowing restlessly
Those leaves upon my yard
Gotta find a way outside
But nothing seems too open
Go away so I can see you near me
Near enough so I can see you fly
I hope you understand me
But I know you never will
I know you never will
Don't leave me here while I'm waiting right there on your porch
She's stays quiet while they riot
Why I know everything changes tonight
I'm taking my chances
I'm running with everything that I get from you
She screams she screams my name at night
She screams she screams my name at night
I'd rather rather give up then give in
I'd rather rather give up then leave it all behind
I see it in your face
I see right through your disguises
Just know I'll never be the one to run and hide
One more little lie out of that mouth
I know that I'll be there
She screams she screams my name at night
She screams she screams my name at night
She got her fist clamped tight and her feet on the ground
She got her lips sewn shut she's not making a sound
I'd rather rather give up then give in
I'd rather rather give up then give in
Speed it up speed it up girl your moving so slow for me
So casually don't you see
Your never gonna catch me at that speed
Your moving in way to slow
I know everything changes tonight why though...
She screams she screams my name at night
She screams she screams my name at night
She got her fist clamped tight and her feet on the ground
She got her lips sewn shut she's not making a sound
I'd rather rather give up then give in
I'd rather rather give up then give in
One more minute to keep the record spinning I need this
We need this please don't let me go
One more minute to keep the record spinning I need this
We need this please don't let me go
She screams she screams my name at night
She screams she screams my name at night
Come on give me your hips
Come on give me your lips
I wanna pull you in so tight
I know I'm not the reason she's been sleeping in so late she's not a whore
Although I may be the reason for deep breathing caused her pants to hit the floor
I see a little bit of me inside of you
So I hate you hate you
Despite that fact I'll try
Thought you'll see me so deprived
From love I'll feed you lies tonight
What was the point of leaving me behind
Then you call me on the phone at night
When you were all alone despite that
I lie I lie a lot to be honest with you it meant nothing
I lie I lie a lot to be honest with you it meant nothing
She sleeps wit one eye opened
So she'll see me down the hall
I lie I lie a lot to be honest with you it meant nothing
She takes advantage of my shyness
Though my kindness is just an act
That I will rarely ever display
She leaves a message for me
Like she could ever compete with new girl
What was the point of leaving me behind you
What was the reason that you see him
Then you call me on the phone at night
When you were all alone despite that
I lie I lie a lot to be honest with you it meant nothing
I lie I lie a lot to be honest with you it meant nothing
She sleeps wit one eye opened
So she'll see me down the hall
I lie I lie a lot to be honest with you it meant nothing
Open your window cause here I come now
Your so distracting it could kill
I lie I lie a lot to be honest with you it meant nothing
I lie I lie a lot to be honest with you it meant nothing
She sleeps wit one eye opened
So she'll see me down the hall
You feel the poison in your veins
Just know its form the needles that we shared
So stop pretending your afraid
You never ever close your eyes in the first place
So don't you tell me that I must be crazy
Look in the mirror can you see my face
Hear her cry by my side
I didn't think we would last this time
I'll try despite the lies
Can you feel the pain
Despite what we envisioned since my vision
It's been blurred since the start
So don't you tell me that I must be crazy
Look in the mirror can you see my face
Hear her cry by my side
Didn't think we would last this time
I'll try despite the lies
She turned her back despite the words he told her
She's on his mind despite the time despite the price that it cost
Somehow my heart is still intact
Despite the seeds I've sewn
Your sent infect my sheets and
The sires sing so slow
So callous show no impact
So far from all I've known
Please tell my baby I'll be back
Hear her cry by my side
Didn't think it would last this time
I'll try despite the lies
She turned her back despite the words he told her
She's on his mind despite the time despite the price that it cost
So this is how it feels to feel for that last time
So maybe not so maybe not like the first time
So much like that one time you know that one time I made you scream my name
Believe me the pain subsides when it rains outside
I swear there screaming from the words that you said is this the
Way it should be is this the way it should be
Love it or leave it I kept
Between the sheets its stayed it never came out my mouth
I know it's not what I was told in the first place
I know it's not what I was told in the first place
She's screaming at the top of her lungs
Love it or leave it I kept the secret to myself
Love it or leave it I kept
Between the sheets its stayed it never came out my mouth
I know it's not what I was told in the first place
I know it's not what I was told in the first place
Just know I'm the best thing despite what your friends think
Kissing you was a contradiction
Feeling confined and so much worse
Even if it didn't mean a thing to you
Love it or leave it I kept
Between the sheets its stayed it never came out my mouth
I know it's not what I was told in the first place
I know it's not what I was told in the first place
Take everything I once gave you
She seems so perfect until she fades away
Tonight's the night tired of thinking tired of drinking never sleeps
A wink at night it's time to give in
Of all of her sober directions fading.
Part of me for the ones that are the same.
Now that you see that I'm on your mind.
Now that you realize you got no time.
The way before the night time.
She's the one that I hold in my heart.
She's the one that I hold in my heart.
I know that you notice.
I don't even want to know.
But I was right there all the time.
The way before the nighttime.
She's the one that I hold in my heart.
She's the one that I hold in my heart.
She's done the same to me
That she did to all her friends.
And didn't even give time to tend.
I know you were never my friend.
I know that I will never breath again.
Before I knew what you were.
She's the one that I hold in my heart.
She's the one that I hold in my heart.
If looks could kill you'd be a murderer maybe just a whore
If looks could kill you'd be a murderer maybe just a whore
If looks could kill you'd be a murderer maybe just a whore
I found out so much more walking through that door became chore
I'm sorry for bleeding on your porch
But of course I tried to keep my heart inside
Of my chest but it fell through
That's why I'm here with you
If looks could kill you'd be a murderer maybe just a whore
I found out so much more walking through that door became chore
If looks could kill you'd be a murderer maybe just a whore
I found out so much more walking through that door became chore
It's a comfort to know
If you watched him go
What your leaving to scream your name
Is this what you wanted
If this what you going I'll bleed again
Take a we'll leave them all alone
See their eyes and the lights so far from home
With a flick of the tongue
And a shake of in hips
And the look in your eye in the radio light
If looks could kill you'd be a murderer maybe just a whore
I found out so much more walking through that door became chore
I'm sorry for bleeding on your porch
But of course I tried to keep my heart inside
Of my chest but it fell through
If looks could kill you'd be a murderer maybe just a whore
If looks could you'd be a whore
If looks could kill you'd be a murderer maybe just a whore
I found out so much more walking through that door became chore
If looks could kill you'd be a murder maybe just a whore
Maybe I'm the murderer
If looks could kill you'd be
Any little bit any little bit
Raise your voice come on come on and scream it out
Slowly sipping from the drink he bought her
Half the make up sitting on his collar
All his friends told him not to bother but everything is going right tonight
Kisses make up smears her eyes
Keeps pretending she's alright
Can you have me be the quiet tonight
Why you hoping the words
Going in for the kiss
Every bit of the hurt
Everyone one of the words she sings so sweet so useless
Hanging from the rooftop by her finger tips
Self serving and quiet
I say we be what she would want
Any little bit any little bit
Raise your voice come on come on and scream it out
Can you have me be the quiet tonight
Why you hoping the words
Going in for the kiss
Every bit of the hurt
Everyone one of the words she sings so sweet so useless
You always told me you'd be faithful
You always told me you'd be true
You always acted different with me
He's looking in her eyes tonight
Pretty soon he's going to recognize
That the fire that they once had burning
Seems to fade fade away in the night time.
That the words that you told me
Contradict contradiction
What you did in the night time.
Try to read between the lines.
I know you miss my lips come back because they kissed your lips
I know you miss the places that I place my finger tips
Who will love you like I did
I know you miss the way we kiss the day away in my bed
I know you'll never get these clever words outside of your head
Who will love you like I did
Try to read between the lines.
I hope you come back come back come back
I hope you come back come back come back home tonight
I've been dying just been try just been trying
I never meant to make you go away.
Try to read between the lines.
I hope you come back come back come back home tonight
Come back come back come back home
I can't believe my ears
Or how you'd ever found out
Those were the lies that came out of your mouth
I've been crying way too long
Lying here without you
I'm never gonna go back
Never gonna go back to you
I'll give it up and go back
Give up and go back to you
She cries herself to sleep at night
And no one's there to dry her eyes
And you know it won't be me
You know it won't be me
Never did I know I would try to take your lie
Never did I know that you would take my heart
But you did and I wish you well
Because I can't hold out forever
And now it's better off this way
Open up your arms tonight
You know you really want to let me in your heart tonight
You wanna let me on in
You know I would love to help
She cries herself to sleep at night
And no one's there to dry her eyes
She knows it won't be me
You know it won't be me
Every time you're crying
I like to think of how we would be
But does it matter because you left me now
But I'm glad that you did
And now it's better off this way
Open up your arms tonight
You know you really want to let me in your heart tonight
You wanna let me on in
You know I would love to help
I'm never gonna go back
I'm never gonna go back to you
I'll give it up and go back
Give up and go back to you
She cries herself to sleep at night
And no one's there to dry her eyes
You know it won't be me
She knows it won't be me
Take things for granted
I'm waiting by the phone now
I still lie all alone
I still lie all alone
You try to talk but the words won't...
I know you missed me all along
I know you missed me all a...
I try to talk but the words won't come out loud
I know you missed me all along
You try to talk but the words won't come around
I know you missed me all along
I try to talk but the words won't come around
I know you missed me all along
You try to talk but the words won't...
I know you missed me all along
I won't look down now
I'll try to talk but the words won't...
I missed you all along
He whispers gently in her ear as they drive off in a car.
She drops her jaw and said she's heard him on the radio.
Those thoughts are racing through his brain as if they were speeding cars.
I am lonely and and I notice stuff is nothing just to show it
It takes more to stick together
And I never meant to make you cry
Acting like you're perfect
Everything was worth it
That I know the lady's going out with other guys
Acting like you're perfect
Acting like you're worth it
All you ever did was pray for guys
I am lonely and and I notice stuff is nothing just to show it
Can't believe they're still together
Even after all the times she cried
Acting like you're perfect
Acting like you're worth it
Seem like you're just a waste of time
That I know the lady's going out with other guys
Acting like you're perfect
Acting like you're worth it
All you ever did was pray for guys
I am lonely and and I notice stuff is nothing just to show it
You like greasy and disgusting is the way you go
Kicking our words to the curb like a former song
I'm seeing my life go down the drain
I am lonely and and I notice stuff is nothing just to show it
I am lonely and and I notice stuff is nothing just to show it
Not quite like the last
And now I see him walking far away
Blasting down the street tonight
It's a cold from the season
That she'll be pleasing me all night
She takes all my pains away
Relieves all my cravings I'm craving at night
She loves when I feel awake
She loves when I peel off her clothing at night
Right around the street
She offers me a ride around
It's a cold from the season
That she'll be pleasing me all night
She takes all my pains away
Relieves all my cravings I'm craving at night
She loves when I feel awake
She loves when I peel off her clothing at night
She takes all my pains away
Relieves all my cravings I'm craving at night
She loves when I feel awake
She loves when I peel off her clothing at night
You think it's all about you about you
You think it's all about you
She takes all my pains away
Relieves all my cravings I'm craving at night
She loves when I feel awake
She loves when I peel off her clothing at night
She takes all my pains away
Relieves all my cravings I'm craving at night
She loves when I feel awake
I see inside your eyes
You wanna be here with me and my own
That's fine we never know
The truth is what I'm after
And I know the sign I'm searching for won't show
And I sing about what I dream about
And my dream's loving you tonight
And I have no doubt the words that I shout
And scream so loudly late at night
I don't think that I can handle
Know I think that you'll be fine
I've never met another lover
Who would love me the way that you did
I don't think that I can handle
Know I think that you'll be fine
I've never met another lover
Who would love me the way that you did
Like I have been kicked in the chest
And I know you never cared because you're just like all the rest
Baby I sing about what I dream about
And my dream's loving you tonight
And I have no doubt the words that I shout
And scream so loudly late at night
I don't think that I can handle
Know I think that you'll be fine
I've never met another lover
Who would love me the way that you did
I don't think that I can handle
Know I think that you'll be fine
I've never met another lover
Who would love me the way that you did
I don't think that I can handle
Know I think that you'll be fine
I've never met another lover
Who would love me the way that you did
I don't think that I can handle
Know I think that you'll be fine
I've never met another lover
Who would love me the way that you did
Never thought that I'd be here for long
Got the cold shoulder
I realized all she ever did was lie to me
I'll try to be the boy you wanted all along
The one that wiped your eyes
And told you you were perfect
Got the cold shoulder
I realized all she ever did was lie to me
I'll try to be the boy you wanted all along
The one that wiped your eyes
And told you you were perfect
Got the cold shoulder
I realized all she ever did was lie to me
I'll try to be the boy you wanted all along
The one that wiped your eyes
And told you you were perfect
Got the cold shoulder
I realized all she ever did was lie
Got the cold shoulder
I'll tell you a secret I hope you can keep it
I hope you can keep my secret close don't tell a soul don't tell a soul.
I've been waiting just to see this I've been waiting to let this out.
I know she sees it. I can see it in her eyes no doubt.
She makes her way downtown. she makes her way downtown
All I wanted was something real I all wanted all I wanted was something real
Something real just so I could feel just so I could feel
Tell me don't you know what I think about at night
I'll tell you something I'll tell you something
I'm murdered apart as I drove a car back home back home
From chain reaction to my distraction was the fake eyelashes
I wanted snatch them right off her eyes
Off her eyes I wanted to snatch them
I've never seen anything quite so perfect
I've never seen anyone quite so pure
I've never seen anything that I wanted more. more than you.
I never thought his feeling ever existed I never knew
That I would meet someone like you but I did
But I did you're the shit bitches sweetest bitches sweetest
So I'll try to make my mind up but it never came out right
So I know I left but I'm leaving for you it goes girl you're the shit.
And now I know one thing one thing I know is that I'd never let you go for them.
I've been waiting for something something that would take my breath away and that is you
And tonight I'll try and let you go back where we started
You walked right through that door
He was wearing camouflage pants
He was a hardcore kid for sure
So so so so so over you
It's a bad dream that I can't wake up from
It's a good thing that I can't give up on
And I know there's been a secret that you're trying to keep
And all the late night crying keeps you fighting for sleep
You think I don't know he's between those thighs
I watch him walk out with those guilty eyes
And he's another little secret that you're trying to keep
I hope the late night fighting sends you crying
I hope you drown in all the lies that you've been telling
It's too late to pretend you want me
And I know that there's a secret that you're trying to keep
I hope you drown in all the lies that you've been telling
Stutter stutter stutter
And choke on your lies
But you could've done a little bit better
So I believe it's that time for you to be together
I'm sorry I don't care what you said
But you can fill that space in my bed
White dress at my party
She wanted to be alone with nobody
But I stood near her until she saw me
And when she looked up
White dress at your party
I wanted to be alone with nobody
But you stood near me
And you don't know me
You act like an only child
I'm sorry I don't care what you said
But you can fill that space in my bed
I know what she's thinking
So you should hold me
You'll be my one and only
I'm sorry I don't care what you said
But you can fill that space in my bed
I'm sorry I don't care what you said
But you can fill that space in my bed
It started out between the sheets
But now I need you here with me
It started out between the sheets
But now I need you here with me
I'm sorry I don't care what you said
But you can fill that space in my bed
I'm sorry I don't care what you said
But you can fill that space in my bed
You think about it every night before you go to bed
You wonder what it would be like to be with me instead
But you second guessed and missed your second chance
I heard you'd gone a little crazy through a friend of mine
Wishing life was like a movie so you could rewind
Sometimes mistakes they never end
These breaks won't stop for you again
Could have been with me
I said that you'd be sorry
You still replaced me
But I know your looking for a little more than that
I hope that it hurts now
To see me all decked out
Back then you thought I was a loser
I'd been rising since the minute
You should be careful who you choose
She looks me in the eye
She was mistaken but now I'm taken
I am lonely and and I notice stuff is nothing just to show it
It takes more to stick together
And I never meant to make you cry
Acting like you're perfect
Everything was worth it
That I know the lady's going out with other guys
Acting like you're perfect
Acting like you're worth it
All you ever did was pray for guys
I am lonely and and I notice stuff is nothing just to show it
Can't believe they're still together
Even after all the times she cried
Acting like you're perfect
Acting like you're worth it
Seem like you're just a waste of time
That I know the lady's going out with other guys
Acting like you're perfect
Acting like you're worth it
All you ever did was pray for guys
I am lonely and and I notice stuff is nothing just to show it
You like greasy and disgusting is the way you go
Kicking our words to the curb like a former song
I'm seeing my life go down the drain
I am lonely and and I notice stuff is nothing just to show it
I am lonely and and I notice stuff is nothing just to show it
To walk away from love
We gonna sell the outcome
We will always have us in a photograph album
And I don't care about the baggage or the bad times
And she said take all the memories we're never going home
Even though the road was rough
We gonna sell the outcome
We will always have us in a photograph album
And I don't care about the baggage or the bad times
And she said take all the memories we're never going home
And she said take all the memories we're never going home
We're going uphill from here from now on
We're going uphill from here from now on
And she said take all the memories we're never going home
And she said take all the memories we're never going home
Not quite like the last
And now I see him walking far away
Blasting down the street tonight
It's a cold from the season
That she'll be pleasing me all night
She takes all my pains away
Relieves all my cravings I'm craving at night
She loves when I feel awake
She loves when I peel off her clothing at night
Right around the street
She offers me a ride around
It's a cold from the season
That she'll be pleasing me all night
She takes all my pains away
Relieves all my cravings I'm craving at night
She loves when I feel awake
She loves when I peel off her clothing at night
She takes all my pains away
Relieves all my cravings I'm craving at night
She loves when I feel awake
She loves when I peel off her clothing at night
You think it's all about you about you
You think it's all about you
She takes all my pains away
Relieves all my cravings I'm craving at night
She loves when I feel awake
She loves when I peel off her clothing at night
She takes all my pains away
Relieves all my cravings I'm craving at night
She loves when I feel awake
Searching for something
Don't know what it is
Constantly searching for what
Finally it's brilliant
Maybe someday I'll open my eyes
Staring at the ceiling again
Staring at the ceiling again
When things don't go your way
Maybe this is what you needed
All that was so clear
Maybe it's time you realized
Staring at the ceiling again
Staring at the ceiling again
Tearing down your picture
Tearing down your picture
So much like that one time you know that one time I made you scream my name
Believe me the pain subsides
When it rains outside
I swear they're crying from the words that you said
She's screaming at the top of her lungs
Love it or leave I kept the secret to myself
Between the sheets it stayed it never came out my mouth
I know it's not what I was told in the first place I know it's not what I was told in the first place
Love it or leave I kept the secret to myself
Between the sheets it stayed it never came out my mouth
I know it's not what I was told in the first place I know it's not what I was told in the first place
Just know I'm the best thing
Well Despite what your friends think
Despite what your friends think
Just know I'm the best thing
Kissing me was a contradiction. feeling confined is so much worse
Even if it doesn't mean a thing to you it meant the world to me you mean the world to me
Kissing you was a contradiction. feeling confined hurt so much worse
Even if it didn't mean a thing to you it meant the world to me you mean the world to
Love it or leave I kept the secret to myself
Between the sheets it stayed it never came out my mouth
I know it's not what I was told in the first place I know it's not what I was told in the first place
Love it or leave I kept the secret to myself
Between the sheets it stayed it never came out my mouth
And I'm breathing too hard to make it on my own
Everyone inside keeps on asking me what I am doing with my life
Razorblades will never kill this kind of cancer
But I saw you in the light waiting for me with a knife
If you want me baby here I am
My eyes just never close
I saw you in the light while waiting for me with a knife
So I saw you in the light while waiting for me with a knife
Finding hope and constant lies.
Tried my hardest to just cut these strings.
These strings that hold me back.
I don't know just what he tells you
I don't know why you make me feel this way.
But still I'm falling faster.
I don't know just what he tells you
Telling me to run and get you.
You need to fall this time.
I don't know just what he tells you
Keeping the letters written in lipstick
Can't believe everything has happened to me at the same time.
Tell me do you listen
Tell me do you care what I'm about
So I know you're gone
She sleeps so quiet and so cold
She tells me no she's lost control
So now everybody's trying to make me who they
Just like the words she tells
And I'm to the next one I don't need no reasons
Tell me do you listen
Tell me do you care what I'm about
So I know you're gone
She sleeps so quiet and so cold
She tells me no she's lost control
So now everybody's trying to make me who they
Just like the words she tells
Just know that this time
Just know I'm playing for blood
I'll tell another lie
I'll tell another lie
Just know that this time
Just know I'm playing for
I'll tell another lie
I'll tell another lie
Just know that this time
Just know I'm playing for blood
I'll tell another lie
I'll tell another lie
Just know that this time
Just know I'm playing for
God your face is so persuasive
Lets just face this because I can barely even hold on never thought that I'd be here for long
So baby why don't you live it up live it up live it up now slit your wrists baby maybe like your losing control live it up live it up another let down until you weep and see what I've been trying to get across to you
Got the cold shoulder never meant to hold her as we got older realized all she ever did was lie to me I'll try to be the boy you wanted all along the one that wiped your eyes and told you you were perfect when you're not
Got the cold shoulder never meant to hold her as we got older realized all she ever did was lie to me I'll try to be the boy you wanted all along the one that lied too you and told you you were perfect
Hearts don't break they bend
And scars don't close they mend
So how you feel about that
I read your letter said return to sender
Oh wait that letters from me
So ill wait for you by the corner
The corner where we met and you left me
Waiving goodbye as your tissue left the train
Pain wont cease to end I've lost my closest friend
So how you feel about that
Does the envy kill you like a knife still in you
If not then can we pretend
So ill wait for you by the corner
The corner where we met and you left me
Waiving goodbye as your tissue left the train
So should I save you slit your wrists and pray
You will understand or should I save you for the taking
So ill wait for you by the corner
The corner where we met and you left me
Cash cold that's what I need
These bill collectors they ring my phone
They bother me when I'm not at home
Ain't go no time to be fooling round
I want money lots and lots of money
I want the pie in the sky
I want money lots and lots of money
So don't be asking me why
I want my cake wanna eat it too
I want the stars and the silver moon
I spend my money on lottery
I want money lots and lots of money
I want the pie in the sky
I want money lots and lots of money
So don't be asking me why
Love peace and happiness
I want all the things that lovers do
A pocketful of dreams come true
Everything you can not find
That'll keep you satisfied and rich
Here is what your gonna do
I want money lots and lots of money
I want the pie in the sky
I want money lots and lots of money
So don't be asking me why
Be rich I wanna be rich
I know what I mean baby
Everyday and every way
There are songs I must sing to you
There are rhymes there are remedies
For what we have is true
Don't you know that time
Is as endless as forever
So each day I love you
You are my everything
You are my hopes and my dreams
You are my everything
So each day I love you
There are sounds from a symphony
Trickily fill the air
And when you're not there
My world is feeling blue
With the dawn comes the morning
You're the only one to turn
Don't you know that love's
Like an ocean overflowing
I would send you kiss each time
Can't you see that time
Is as endless as forever
So each day I love you
You are my everything
You are my hopes and my dreams
You are my everything
So each day I love you
You are my everything
You are my hopes and my dreams
You are my everything
So each day I love you
You are my everything
You are my hopes and my dreams
You are my everything
You're all I ever wanted
You are my everything
So each day I love you
... So each day I love you

Scared to love cause of the he say she say.
I just expect it... To lose it all in the end.
I can just imagine. thinking that's why my enemies haven't took me out.
I'm just stuck in misery many thoughts in my head got me going nuts.
Scared to speak my true feeling and be labeled crazy.
Must be what they want. Don't want to see me on top.
Throwing dirt on my name.
But Calvin Can't be stopped. I just can't believe they put there dope down
But now I got a team. Prepare for the take over.
You just talk to people I barely associate with.
Is to be laying in the dirt.
People calming I'm shady. I am. But in a different definition.
Just sit back relax and calm your nerves.
I try to keep it that way.
Big booty and all that's how I remember it.
Her eyes got me wanting to stare at her for a wile.
So perky Moving it with so much class.
Giving me hints the way she move like she wanting to make love. I can picture it now.
She just make me smile.
She got that sweet smell to her. its natural.
No one can capture he sent. I'm going for her heart.
Took me to a new place. She stay in shape. check the definition of them legs. her silhouette alone
Would bring a man to his knee's. I'm on the same level as her truly feeling it.
A vibe set a night not to forget. there will be more.
Dude back at it. spitting it ill.
The truth you pretend. No game its natural. doing what I do.
Quit that roll playing realest on the seen. dude smash a flow and kick another.
In your mind I know you thinking that mother fucker.
The most hated I represent it. I know the girls love me if not then id be a fool.
I'm old school keep studying like some beggars old busters raggedy. you can't get at me.
Still got it ain't coming off it. Boss in this. something mean
Ain't shy I represent. Smoking grits and herb. Making that cash quick.
The realest MC them others is imitating. not copy's.
You know I'm known to bring it to you all night. hitting it raw like my lyrics with a passion.
Baby stare me in my eyes
You know just how I like it wet knowing I can get you there old school thug you know I ain't scared.
Got no reason to be shy. The star of my city. Doing so good the hater know me well.
You know I could do you better. I got that silk rug bring them pumps. you know I'm a freak
And can flip my tongue crazy. Lady let me lay you down.
When I come around you know you happy when you see me. the freshest cat. hat to the left and back.

Its in the way you moan. Keep me coming back and got you blowing up my phone.
No late night conversations cause you know we making love.

Hoping you knowing I'm waiting with Patience and you so quick to cum. the pussy I don't want to leave it.

Let's do it for the love or the lust. As long as there is trust we can stick together. If not then what ever.

I know you want it could see threw the smile and the squint in your eye.
This is your boy speaking to you. I ain't like them begging chumps. They trash.
She's what I was missing
Love making erotic let your mind drift just good time you the one I'm with
Keep it true and hold it down got me in check she my mate no need for another unless she feeling freaky
Then she call her best friend that she been knowing
So I took it slow and the love did grow
I got the ring just need the nerve to ask is this to fast what do I have to lose
Nothing everything else I loved is gone
Not the player type you find in these times
Just a woman with good morals and she fine
She shine got that glow to her skin others attempt but I got her on lock
Yeah girl what you think
I still dot know but when a good moment comes I grasp it. Known for mashing like 195 proof. Spitting the truth
Only to lie in the end. Six feet deep. With the rest of my friends.
I'm trying to be that spark that reaches the world. Make me do the best like when I'm with my girl.
Life sometime so hard but still I strive. It's my destiny. I'm gonna survive. Trying to live life
Hope its from old age and not from a bullet. Fin to be like one of the greatest. But I don't want to end up just like them.
Wish I could laugh my past filled with pain.
I was used to being used. That was the norm till I went crazy like Jim and rode out with the storm.
It broke my heart to watch her leave. But bet it was something that I needed. I was stuck on a love truly blind.
Cause it was a love that I never really had in fact. Felt so cold but got the fire burning in my heart.
I desire a love that's gonna last not these hoes that don't know how to act where to start couldn't
The way she do me ain't nothing like you. I feel like I'm feeling the breeze in the summer time. fuck you.
Me and her. It's so nice. So sweet.
Well... Hell... I can't lie. Trying to find love in you is like hunting a snip.
She my love in life. Got me loving life. Now I'm living in it. What I wanted from the beginning.
Nothing lefty to say I'm in mint condition. I keep the pimping and my girl by my side. It feels me with pride.
But yes you turn around. Go back to him like you wan the drama back in you life. I know I make it sound nice.
But try experiencing this in real life. Daily fights over nothing. If she trying to get rid of me
Why don't she say something.
My Gums ain't bumping. Just trying got to speak My half. But yet y'all just don't know the half.
Wishing I could take it back to how it was real love doesn't fade. I know I should know better but
I guess I'm in a daze.
Can't you see the tracks of my tears from sadness and fear of you not being here. I worried some say
For some one who don't even care.
Got me sitting here dazing in a log stair. Thinking about how I can get you back in my life.
Still shocked to the fact this happened over night a Lil fight got us not talking for life.
But somehow my hearts going in two directions. One wants you as my selection the other one saying
It puts pain in my heart thinking back how I used to do her
I'm just surprised she's still here to this day
If it wasn't for her id be in the slums
She ain't no gold digger looking for money
Just a girl that understands and truly loves me
That's hard to find. A woman with heart
Lucky I met her in my youth. We've grown together. Gonna get old together
Ain't nothing no better than this girl by my side
I tell them it just comes. It don't go
You where the one talking about thug for life
Now you sitting at home with ya kids and ya wife
I'm still keeping it g
Introduced me to the life of crime now you asking what the fuck is wrong with me
Saying the shot needs to stop you sounding like ya pops when we'd get suited and booted
With the bandannas ready to do it
13 and shit a young bad ass committing the crime and screaming prove it with the blunt in my hand
You got me in to this and now I don't know why
I took you in gave you close and half my meals
But look now how you do me stealing my shit to trade it to get your fix
Yeah boogie down to that boogie down to that
The emotion running threw me as I reed once again
In the heat of the passion and good times is what I remember
Seems they can't let go its holding me back From how they only talk and bring up the bad parts of the past
And a team of shit talkers convincing them I ain't no good
Just a normal man ain't representing no hood
Not a robber just an author Speaking poetry to the sound of music
Loss of contact all tho its to late to keep in touch
Got so many letters it could keep me busy for months
All the stunts and antic you figure I wouldn't fall for these tricks
I'm soft in heart strong in mind
So deceiving hart telling what when on when I was sleeping in my own bed
It stained my feelings and the way I approach women
I wonder sometimes how they could let it all go
I can't tell. Never will able
Wishing a real woman would step up and throw them away. Bring them better days
I'm only 19 just don't want to get to where its to late
Girls went from loving and innocent to insane
For a few I acted the same way only during the break up
In my mind I know most where sent only to make an illusion that I'm evil
Some girls even made me lose my closest boys
Quick to approach and give you all of my kindness
I'm sane with my mind set on loving true
Insane to that and feeling USED
Been threw several lovers none stand out
I guess I could be thought of as a thug
Closed door low lights alone some times
I can wait but so much time has passed
Felling like my love life has been one black mass
And these are my people
Yeah these are my people
And these are my people
Dropped like I'm nothing
I'm rubbing shoulders with the best
Late nights no one to love
Always some one to fuck but ill pass
Wasn't all that actions to back it up
The big drop is when you see me rolling and I just pass
I know you wishing We would stop chill and we laugh
The way I wanted it And so it was brought forth
And these are my people
Yeah these are my people
And these are my people
My people got it out for me
Not paranoid I think deep
Deep enough to see past
Something else is what I'm on
Dropping a note and a load of lead for those acting crazy
Thinking they busing some heads
Was I summoned on earth to suffer or make those who make people suffer
Just want to be heard
And these are my people
Yeah these are my people
Deep down inside I could never see us separated
I miss looking in your eyes right before we kiss
You act like you don't want to see me no more
No goodbye's just break it off
Leave me feeling like a preacher who lost his congregation
I'm thinking there's another or is it your just now good at being a lover
I know we had are mishaps
We need to get back and get right no shiest
If I'm shady then why do I pick up my pen and write about you baby
For ever my lady distant lover I'm be right here so it up to you
When you roll threw I'll be right here
But you got my mind so confused
Tell me you love me knowing to you I'm nothing
Just waiting on the day when I can see you face
When is my pain gonna end you feel me knocking
Why don't you let me in
An illusion for shits and giggles
What's the but of this joke cause you looking like the ass
You come in to my life so fast and left the same way
Left me hurting feeling like no one truly cares
Should I be over it maybe just pretend
Be like you and keep my feelings bottled in
No baby I want to see you again
But you got my mind so confused
Tell me you love me knowing to you I'm nothing
Just waiting on the day when I can see you face
Now ever since I seen you
Your eyes bee deceiving
Popping out my dreams like it was fucking whoring season
Never plained for the years to come.
Trying to lift the stress caused more stress.
The guy standing there squinting as if he had been threw it all and lost all hope void from the surroundings.
Hard telling what's in is head or on his shoulders.
That's me. Not the image I chose.
Lost in the world for a loss.
No payback I'm throw back to all that was
And those that come wont last.
Peace's of my past somewhat haunt my brain.
The only man who could look the lord in the eyes and say god damn.
Justified no cause it was the effect.
In the Indiana weather
When it cold and ya girl by ya side feel the warmth
In the Indiana weather
Cold chill to the air. mid October. hay rides. deep gazing eyes.
Rusty leafs. standing there with ya lady like its gold on the ground.
In the Indiana weather
I have none of that. haters blocked that.
In this Indiana weather got ice in my vanes fire in my heart.
No bags under my eyes sleeping the time off.
Every weekend nothing popping off.
Not missing out on a lot but death.
Just the surroundings and others actions to blame.
Y'all just don't understand a young man several tears ran
On them cold fall night cruising or walking trying to clear my head.
As much as I get out no new people.
Where's my start falling far short of what I want.
In the Indiana weather
When it cold and ya girl by ya side feel the warmth
In the Indiana weather
Cold chill to the air. mid October. hay rides. deep gazing eyes.
Rusty leafs. standing there with ya lady like its gold on the ground.
In the Indiana weather
Never know on to have heart never know real love in my heart
People say I got heart I know cause its throbbing beating out my chest.
Or maybe I am that angle soon to come and now is.
Who listens who takes heed.
All I want is some one to believe in me and not trust in money.
That's something. ill still be here waiting with the sounds bumping.
I don't give in or get out.
Seems I shouldn't bee just picture me on top without all the hate and negativity
In the Indiana weather
When it cold and ya girl by ya side feel the warmth
In the Indiana weather
Cold chill to the air. mid October. hay rides. deep gazing eyes.
Rusty leafs. standing there with ya lady like its gold on the ground.
In the Indiana weather
Laid back. Lost and lonely. Feeling Like I'm drifting
Right handed player stepping up left on bat
Not knowing if my life would be
A paradise where everything is lavish
Or a pair of dice like I'm lucky to have it
I still don't know but when a good moment comes I grasp it
Known for mashing like 195 proof
Six feet deep with the rest of my friends
The world is cold when come a time to forget
Better yet not get in that position
Got nothing on my mind
Just forgetting all my sorrows
If the world shuts me out
Got nothing on my mind
Just forgetting all my sorrows
When the world the world lets me down
Just a G. Keeping it real
... Give me that beat I'll show them how I feel
We taking over so let me reach your heart
I'm trying to be that spark that reaches the world
Make me do the best like when I'm with my girl
They say I got heart but when do the pain stop
I'm just trying to reach the youth
Life sometime so hard but still I strive
It's my destiny. I'm gonna survive
Trying to live life to the fullest. And when I die
Hope it's from old age and not from a bullet
Fin to be like one of the greatest
But I don't want to end up just like them
A true friend is what I am to those who accept it
And when it come time to reminisce
Wish I could laugh my past filled with pain
You know what I'm saying
Threw all this I'm still in it
I'll be a ghost haunting
Got nothing on my mind
Just forgetting all my sorrows
If the world shuts me out
Got nothing on my mind
Just forgetting all my sorrows
When the world the world lets me down
Keep the peace and get pussy
Brother that you'll never forget
Can tell he eats his supper meat and potatoes with the whole wheat bread
Still I'm rolling hard like a colonel blunt in my mouth
Hat cocked to the left
Smoking Winston and Marlboro light
Trying to find new pussy and dodge them haters trying to fight
I stay on my feat stepping out stout like some brute cologne
That thug Calvin Still in the house tonight
Hat to the left and back
In it like it was and always
Suckers don't even know they trowed and tipsy
I'm left wide receiver pass it take it I get it
Calvin truly something
Known for late night loving
New session boss stomping chucks in my face she giving me affection
Make it happen stacking
Living life rugged the good in my grasps but I can't tough it
I keep going most thought I would say fuck it
The bull shit and drama part of every day life understand
Something else loud no stealth
Quick to approach and give you my kindness
I'm sane with my mind set on loving true
Insane to that and feeling USED
Been threw several lovers none stand out
I guess I could be thought of as a thug
Closed door low lights alone some times
I can wait but so much time has passed
Felling like my love life has been one black mass
Dropped like I'm nothing
I'm rubbing shoulders with the best
Late nights no one to love
Always some one to fuck but ill pass
Wasn't all that actions to back it up
The big drop is when you see me rolling and I just pass
I know you wishing I would would stop chill and we laugh
And I show no emotion
The way I wanted it And so it was brought forth
My people got it out for me
Not paranoid I think deep
Deep enough to see past
Something else is what I'm on
Dropping a note and a load of lead for those acting crazy
Thinking they busing some heads
Was I summoned on earth to suffer or make those who make people suffer
Just want to be heard
The base through my feet
We've got this beat pumping
We've got this beat pumping
We've got this beat pumping
We've got this beat pumping
Let your body just flow
We've got this beat pumping
We've got this beat pumping
We've got this beat pumping
We've got this beat pumping
Tonight is the night I keep on singing this.
We've got this beat pumping
We've got this beat pumping
We've got this beat pumping
We've got this beat pumping
Something must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
Off of one touch I could overdose
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
Your hair's grown a little longer
Your arms look a little stronger
Your smile's just a little softer
I still feel everything when you are near
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years
Couldn't help but overhear you
Sounds like you're happy with her
I still feel everything when you are near
And you probably will never know
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years
I never told you after all these years
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
But the way she kills you makes you feel alive
And you know that it feels right
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with
I loved him when I left him
My heart is in Havana
Fresh out East Atlanta
Take me back to my Havana...
All of my heart is in Havana
I wanna love you inside out
Wanna love you inside out
I wanna love you inside out
I don't wanna know no word of mouth
Wanna love you inside out
I wanna love you inside out
I don't wanna know no word of mouth
Thought you could go on without me
Now you can't see you without me
Wanna love you inside out
I wanna love you inside out
I don't wanna know no word of mouth
Wanna love you inside out
I wanna love you inside out
I wanna love you inside out
I don't wanna know no word of mouth
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences
Loving you still takes shots at me
And I lost so much more than my senses
This paper town has let me down too many times
I guess I'm too naive to read the signs
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
Gotta get up out of this town
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
Gotta get up out of this town
With somebody that means something
Spell the names of all our dreams and demons
For the times that I don't understand
Tell me what's the point of a moon like this
Can I run away to somewhere beautiful
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
But I find out what they're all about
All they ever do is let me down
Gotta get up out of this town
But we could only burn so long
Counterfeit emotions only run skin deep
We should know by now
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go
I have never heard a silence quite so loud
You're good at making me feel small
We should know by now
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go
I think I'm breaking right now
I think I'm breaking right now
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go
Vampires at the same places
I know that you feel me
Making the rounds with all your fake friends
I can see you're scared of your emotions
I can see you're looking for distractions
I can see you're tired of the acting
Who are you when it's 3 AM and you're all alone
But you don't even know what her name is
I know that you feel me
Making the rounds with all your fake friends
You can strip down without showing skin
I can see you're looking for distractions
I can see you're tired of the acting
Who are you when it's 3 AM and you're all alone
Who are you when it's 3 AM
I can't make sense of nothing and words just get in the way
Whatever trouble that you're thinking
Don't even ask the question
Something must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'm way too young to be this hurt
I feel doomed in hotel rooms
Staring straight up at the wall
Counting wounds and I am trying to numb them all
Now you're gone and I'm here
I have questions for you
You got some nerve trying to tear my faith apart
I have questions for you
I have questions for you
But it sounds so dangerous to me now
I have questions for you
You got some nerve trying to tear my faith apart
I should have never ever ever trusted you
I have questions for you
I have questions for you
I have questions for you
Now you're gone and I'm here
I have questions for you
I have questions for you
I have questions for you
So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been this free
Let the music warm your body
Like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires
Ain't no crying in the club
Ain't no crying in the club
Ain't no crying in the club
So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been this free
Let the music warm your body
Like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires
Ain't no crying in the club
Ain't no crying in the club
Ain't no crying in the club
Ain't no crying in the club
Ain't no crying in the club
Ain't no crying in the club
Ain't no crying in the club
Guarantee you're gonna wanna leave with me
You cannot believe it when we come through
Ice cold like my drink
You cannot believe it when we come through
Candi alone across the sun
Candi alone into my world
Candi alone across the sun
Candi alone into my world
Candi alone across the sun
Candi alone into my world
Candi alone across the sun
Candi alone into my world
Is not the one I chose to see
On someone who gets much too close to me
I've got this place of my own
Where I can go when I feel I'm coming down
We'll do our best to ensure
You'll feel secure if you come
Love is the thing you crave
But it lies asleep inside of all your heads
For tomorrow you may find that you are dead
I've got this place of my own
Where I can go when I feel I'm coming down
We'll do our best to ensure
You'll feel secure if you come
I've got this place of my own
Where I can go when I feel I'm coming down
We'll do our best to ensure
You'll feel secure if you come
I've got this place of my own
Where I can go when I feel I'm coming down
We'll do our best to ensure
With my mind passing by the thoughts in your eye
If I were you and you were me
Oh please don't mind that I'm here
I'll try and find a place in my mind
Where you know you can go and leave all behind
How does it feel when a dream seems so real
Searching my mind for thoughts left behind
Oh please don't mind that I'm here
I'll try and find a place in my mind
Looking through the keyhole in the door
Taking notes of all that floats
If you will only blow your whistle for me
Take the time to change our minds
We will pay our parking fines soon
It's just I'd like to stay behind my door
You'd better find me what I'm smiling for
No I haven't broke the law
Forty people more locked behind the door in the bathroom
Hope you don't go in for at least an hour
They're taking it in turns to have a shower
Looking through the keyhole in the door
Taking notes of all that floats
If you will only blow your whistle for me
Take the time to change our minds
To escape from the scenes that have been making me want you
So I think of the dreams that I've had and what's left I'd like to do
But my mind draws a blind over me and all I see is you
I can feel the sun in my hair when I'm sitting here with you
I've been living more for myself than I've ever done before
All that I feel and all I see is you
Cecil runs a mill in the garden
So we all go to wee in the garden
So we all go to wee in the garden
Oh what a beautiful scene
Playing underneath my tree
Oh what a beautiful scene I see
Oh what a beautiful scene
Playing underneath my tree
Oh what a beautiful scene I see
So we all go to wee in the garden
So we all go to wee in the garden
Oh what a beautiful scene
Playing underneath my tree
Oh what a beautiful scene I see
Oh what a beautiful scene
Playing underneath my tree
Oh what a beautiful scene I see
But join me anytime if you please
I'm lazy I know but I do anything that I want to do
Fly to my arms and feel your fantasies coming through
Join me and see in the sky
I know that I am not too far away for you to come to
There ain't a storm that my ship can't carry you through
I'm lazy I know but I do anything that I want to do
Fly to my arms and feel your fantasies coming through
Join me and see in the sky
Leather boots smash down the grass
The meal we had was very bad
Too much Yin and not enough Yang
We all will meet with nothing to do
To my surprise in a teardrop reflected
Don't try to find stars in my eyes
We've been there before and seen
Just take what you need to find the sun
Down through the land of limbo
Not knowing whether to come or go
Soon you will see all the stars
Don't listen to the man in the skies
He'll take what he can with his thoughts in his hand
So follow me now and we'll find the sun
Climb inside our fire
Can't you see that you never were alone
We'll take time to play for you now
We'll find you another dream
Just a smile you'll find will make your own scenes
Through the trees that grow by the mill
We can sing a song of laughter
We'll go and ride in your dreams on a hill
Find what you are after
What you make of your world is your own
So come and you'll see why
We'll find you another dream
Just a smile you'll find will make your own scenes
I'll give you everything that I've got if you take me away
I'll give you everything that I've got if you take me away
Sat and played my mind in time with all of you
When you told me how you'd love to live and not to die
I wish I were stoned out of my mind
Dreamed I saw a man walked upon the sea
Dreamed it once again and saw that he was me
Looking close at me I looked a lot like you
Knowing where to go but not quite what to do
I wish I were stoned out of my mind
Give me all your love in a smile
And I'll tell you what I'm thinking
Let me see the world through your eyes
And I'll show you where I'm sitting
Sat and played my mind in time with all of you
When you told me how you'd love to kill and not to die
I wish I were stoned out of my mind
Give me all your love in a smile
And I'll tell you what I'm thinking
Let me see the world through your eyes
And I'll show you where I'm sitting
I've got all that I need
And I'm singing my song to the sky
You know how it feels
With the breeze of the sun in your eye
Not minding that time's passing by
I've got all and more
My smile just as before
Is all that I carry with me
I've got all that I need
And I'm singing my song to the sky
You know how it feels
With the breeze of the sun in your eye
Not minding that time's passing by
I've got all and more
My smile just as before
Is all that I carry with me
With a song on my mind I'm thinking of you
Through the dreams of a million eyes I'll stand still with you
And wait till I find the world that you're searching for
I'm living the life that I choose
And dream I'm sitting here
While magic fires the moon
I turn around my mind
And bid farewell to fear
Swimming through a wish
That I know I'm in a dream
I'm changing the music by ear
I'll have to leave behind
And wanting oh so clear
I catch my breath to find
I've got so far to go
Howling through the trees
A cry which is my ears
Is not the easiest thing
Out of the shadows I see
And blackened till the moon
A magic creature moves
Would you like to ride with me
Can you tell me all you'd like to see
Would you make me take me slightly for you
You and I our only need
Waiting for the band to come
Searching for someone to see
And hoping that the band will come
Chemistries attention taste in your mind
And the thought that puzzled me you may be left behind
Would you like to ride with me
Searching for someone to see
And hoping that the band will come
Would you make me take me slightly for you
Would you believe it possible
Turning upside down inside out
Now someone else my mind
Someone please help me
Just a smile I do for you
So wipe away all those fears
I'm longing to feel the year go slipping by
Would you like to ride with me
Can you tell me all you'd like to see
Would you make me take me slightly for you
Up on a hilltop far from the city
I looked back where I had just been
There just behind a ledge
Clipping away at a hedge
Suddenly I heard a ringing singing
But he was nowhere to be seen
Pulling my trousers up to my knees
I waded across the stream
Back to the place where I could hear sounds
And where the old man once had been
There just behind a ledge
Clipping away at a hedge
I could not hear what he was singing
But I found my ears ringing with the sound
Suddenly I heard a ringing singing
But he was nowhere to be seen
I could not hear what he was singing
But I found my ears ringing with the sound
Suddenly I heard a ringing singing
Wish that I could be you
Wish that I could be you
Wish that I could be you
Wish that I could be you
Wish that I could be you
Wish that I could be you
Sometimes I'm thinking
The nights are always chilly
Streets outside are empty
Wisdom points a finger
Don't go spoiling it for someone else
If your world is big enough for you
Don't go spoiling it for someone else
If your world is big enough for you
Don't go spoiling it for someone else
If your world is big enough for you
Don't go spoiling it for someone else
If your world is big enough for you
The little man who rang
And danced while he sang
Sits in the back of my head
And he knows what to do
When he meets with his lady friend
He came home yesterday
Tells me I've got a new face
And it wasn't my fault
The day he got caught
Sat and played my mind in time with all of you
When you told me how you'd love to live and not to die
I wish I were stoned out of my mind
Dreamed I saw a man walked upon the sea
Dreamed it once again and saw that he was me

Knowing where to go but not quite what to do
I wish I were stoned out of my mind
Give me all your love in a smile
And I'll tell you what I'm thinking
Let me see the world through your eyes
And I'll show you where I'm sitting

Standing on a golf course dressed in PVC
I chanced upon a golf girl selling cups of tea
For three pence you can buy one full right to the brim
And later on the golf course after drinking tea
And we sat under a tree
And we'd go for walks in fine weather
Standing on a golf course dressed in PVC
I chanced upon a golf girl selling cups of tea
For three pence you can buy one full right to the brim
And later on the golf course after drinking tea
And we sat under a tree
Dropping downward through fresh grasses
Bubbles merrily as it passes
Never knowing where you're going
Be conjured up in a midnight dream
As wandering minstrels play tunes of yesterday
When dragons roamed the land
Sailing forward to a new land
All you need but take heed
Remember it pays to pay the sandman well
Make no fuss for you must in stardust
Bells chime three times
Naked dancers enter slowly
Illuminates the breasts of four young girls
Dreams are always ending far too soon
Life's too short to be sad
Wishing things you'll never have
You're better off not dreaming of the things to come
Dreams are always ending far too soon
Sounds of a distant melody
Funny how it's clearer now you're close to me
We'll be together all the time
Sounds of a distant melody
Funny how it's clearer now you're close to me
We'll be together all the time
Sailing forward to a new land
All you need but take heed
Remember it pays to pay the sandman well
Make no fuss for you must in stardust
I dreamed of all the magic things that be
When we'd ride to a dock on bended knee
But you'd just smile and gently shake your head
And put a hole through me so I was dead
Oh how I'd fall down and I was left alone
With a feeling of you still that was my own
How you have the cheek to smile and tell me I'm mad
A man came through the wall and stood by me
Complete with bag of nuts and fancy free
He said without a tonal fleeting glance
How you opened up his head and smiled
And rubbish from your mouth you tipped inside
How you have the cheek to smile and tell me I'm mad
How you have the cheek to smile and tell me I'm mad
So we'll sail away for just one day to the land where the punk weed grows
And when it's dark our boat we'll park on a land of warm and green
So we'll sail away for just one day to the land where the punk weed grows
And when it's dark our boat we'll park on a land of warm and green
Look at the day that is dawning
Think of me now while you're yawning
Sunshine the tears from my cries
What I see I know is real
What I touch I know I feel
If I don't care for what you say
It won't mean much to me today
I see your world that is living
All my love goes straight to you
With just a thought for something new
All I have is what you feel
What I see I know is real
What I touch I know I feel
All my love goes straight to you
There's a place where I can go
Where I listen to the wind singing
Songs of happiness I know
And it brings it all back again
Somewhere deep inside of me
There's a song that I can sing
Jigsaw puzzles on a tree
And it brings it all back again
There are people waiting here who really want to know
And sometimes I think of wine
Songs and laughter flowing free
People talking all the time
And it brings it all back to me
There are people waiting now who really have to know
I wonder what it's meant to be
It's the thought that can despair
And it brings it all back to me
Yes it brings it all back to me
A garden with no gate
Flower imprisoned by ice crystals
The summer came too late
To melt the snow on white hedgerows
Don't let the winter hide you
Or freeze your love for me
Like frozen flowers forgotten
They're flying in the cold
Completely lost in winter's frost
Spend these lonely hours
Dreaming of your touch
I came to love so much
It's spring free frozen flowers
That warm your love for me
For winter can't last long
I tell you that I love you
But still you do not hear
Yet in my dreams I find you
But like mist you disappear
In the gloom of my room
Forgotten frozen flowers
Left flying in the cold
I tell you that I love you
But still you do not hear
And in my dreams I find you
But like mist you disappear
You talk of all the many things that you have
And you smile from day to day
No one has ever seen any of these
And those smiles just fade away
Well I can't help singing this song
When they tell me that the devil is a gentleman too
I know I can't go wrong
I have to slip away today
I've been invited down to stay
Yes I feel my going down
They say that eight fishes call men in the sea
And shoots all the people that fly in the sky
And they chance on his estate
And none but he can do
And they tell me this and tell me that
You'd better believe it's so
I've made up my mind to go
A whole world waits for you
I'll sit with my head thrust down on your knees
And smile for you again
You won't have to worry about anything now
I'll be halfway there by ten
It only takes a moment to decide on the move
It all seems so absurd
Still I know that the devil is a gentleman too
Who never keeps his word
I've made up my mind to go
You'd better believe it's so
Was on a golden golf course dressed in PVC
Chanced to meet a golf girl selling cups of tea
Then later on the golf course after drinking tea
It started raining golf balls and she protected me
Kissed me three kisses
And this is what bliss is
Standing on a golf course dressed in PVC
I chanced upon a golf girl selling cups of tea
For tuppence you can have one full right to the brim
Then later on the golf course after drinking tea
It started raining golf balls and she protected me
Look at the day that is dawning
Think of me now while you're yawning
Sunshine the tears from my cries
What I see I know is real
What I touch I know I feel
If I don't care for what you say
It won't mean much to me today

It's the thought that can despair
And it brings it all back to me
Yes it brings it all back to me
The legs of Waterloo Lily
Black tights for dark nights
On a trip through Piccadilly
If you knew the kind of glue
She gums her eyelids with
That's a gum you'd rather not use
From a jar in the house of Waterloo Lily
The biggest in the city
Sex machines seem but clean
Waterloo Lily's got enough to turn us all on
Got a bra to fit a car
A port upon her back you warm your feet on
A corset keeps her in
So when you pull a string it lets it all out
Pint of white on Lily's lip
Imagine you and Lily too
All the things your sister won't do
Waterloo Lily's got enough to turn us all on
Got a bra to fit a car
A port upon her back you warm your feet on
A corset keeps her in
So when you pull a string it lets it all out
I can't see what was happening
Do you still remember
Yes we passed by as one together
Making songs and signs for open mind
At the time it was fine
I know what you're feeling
Does not fit in reality
You can't leave the scene now
That's more than you can tolerate
Some scene you feel freely
I can't see what was happening
Do you still remember
Yes we passed by as one together
Making songs and signs for open mind
You talk of all the many things that you have
And you smile from day to day
No one has ever seen any of these
And those smiles just fade away
Well I can't help singing this song
When they tell me that the devil is a gentleman too
I know I can't go wrong
I have to slip away today
I've been invited down to stay
Yes I feel my going down

And shoots all the people that fly in the sky
And they chance on his estate
And none but he can do

And smile for you again

It only takes a moment to decide on the move
It all seems so absurd
Still I know that the devil is a gentleman too
Who never keeps his word
I've made up my mind to go
You'd better believe it's so
In dreams of you I wish a song on everyone
Thunder songs of love to make you smile
I could have found as well at home as in the skies
There's so much time misspent in dreams of wealth and fame
When all you need is love in your eyes
Take a cup of newfound wealth
Drink it down into your soul
Let your feelings tell you why
Have no fear for lonely days
Mind in hand you'll find a way
You must believe me till you've tried
Take a cup of newfound wealth
Drink it down into your soul
Let your feelings tell you why
Have no fear for lonely days
Mind in hand you'll find a way
You must believe me till you've tried
Insomuch as we can tell
A shadow clears anew before me
And through our needs we'll tag along
Collecting thoughts for all the others
The world is mine but for a time
Please hear the love I bring for you to follow
Come with me and with diamonds in the sea
And stare the hearts of men whose fight ain't sorrow
It's foolish to suppose you know me well I know
Everything I touch won't turn to gold
Money's not my way although your own lost soul's
Waiting for the day to break that hole
I've never loved someone like I do
The world is yours if you love me too
I've never loved someone like I do
Whisper please some scandal to the trees
I'm sure they would enjoy themselves enormously
Well you and I sit up in the sky
And chase our minds through space and time relentlessly
Circumstances indicate for you and I
Then seldom find the time they know so well
I've never loved someone like I do
The world is yours if you love me too
The world is yours if you love me too
The world is yours if you love me too
The world is yours if you love me too
The world is yours if you love me too
The world is yours if you love me too
The world is yours if you love me too
The world is yours if you love me too
Take a sip from my magic cup
And then time pass you by
You might as well be with me
Cause there's luck in your eye
I heard her say so peacefully
And then smile away the time
What with the mood I'm in
I never was a strength of mind
Or you won't see another day
You'll be the kind of yesteryear
And that's the way you will stay
What I need no asking twice
Is to words I couldn't find
I could hardly believe my eyes
When I saw her standing here
She had flowered herself in green
And had diamonds in her hair
Was it real or was it just a dream
Cross that bridge to a little girl's skirt
Hands on which he's a terrible flirt
Copy him as much as I can
Ride into a dock with only one hand
She was pointing at Ferdinand's hand
In walks Ferdinand's room
Made she cries and beating her chest
You really got the rest
Gotta get used to your feelings
Don't know then how you feel ooh
Well I wanna see you walk a wonder
Such talk will make for you only sorrow
You bet I love you so
But I'm well on my way
And I can't stay till tomorrow
Gotta believe that there's something
Take all the time that you find there
Put down a sunny times feeling
Ask how and decided you're dead
Welcome back since we got real
Thank God you have the time to come in
After all no one knows till tomorrow
Turn off your magic hose girl
Take all the time that you find there
Gotta believe that there's something
If you get on the road that takes you back
There's a lot of things you ought to know
You're going where I wanna be
If you get on the road you've got to take me
Can you see I don't care
I just want the chance to try
I stopped having dreams some time ago
So now it seems I have to show
If there's a chance I've got to find me
Somewhere there's someone who can see
Is all he has to show for love
Oh please help me please
Never knew the light could seem so bright
After all you choose you've got win or lose
I've got my pipe and I've got my song
And I've got love to keep me happy
It's no surprise I've got bleary eyes
But it's all that I have and it's all that I want
Many years ago I thought whenever it shows
I've got my coat and I've got my comb
And I'll dance to the light if he's chasing me home
I've got my pipe and I've got my song
And I've got love to keep me happy
It's no surprise I've got bleary eyes
And we'll be missing you but that's for me to care
Yes indeed that's what we need for everybody to sing
Wanna see you take you by the hand and do some mess around
Get you when nighttime comes along
And we'll be missing you but that's for me to care
After all this time it's got no better
And the words just seem to pass me by
So I think of you in the morning
Singing a song to fill my eyes
Something overcame me
Didn't want to go and pass you by
Blow and slip through your hand
All the breath within me
Leaving me gasping for some air
Hardly seem to matter
You were more than summer days
So much more than words can say
When the years are gone
And we live on memories
No matter where I could be
So much more than I don't know
So much more than words can say
Didn't want to leave you
Something pulling me back hurt me so
From the forest down below
Something seemed nearly dead
Making me feel so cold
Even trees seemed to fear
There was something unreal
Couldn't see very far
And the sky had gone dark
Only thought to get away
On and on we didn't know where we had gone
If it was night or day
I can feel it pulling me down
In my head it felt like something had said
Well I tried so hard not to make a sound
Feeling better I turned round
And coming up behind me I could see
Like shadows in the trees
They came creeping unknown
Keeping close through the ground
I could feel them tramp on
Saw the music they knew
We were somewhere close by
They began to crowd us in
Sinking deeper in pain
Only thought to get away
On and on we didn't know where we had gone
If it was night or day
I can feel it pulling me down
In my head it felt like something had said
Well I tried so hard not to make a sound
Feeling better I turned round
I've got someone that I'd like you to hold
And my brother will tell you that it's good for your cold
Take my hand and we'll try to make a stand
That the world is so full of sin
Never look back on the things that you lack
My mother said that I should stay out of bed
But I know that I like it in there
Suck a sugar dandy Rock and Roll
Lick a licking lozenge cures the soul
Here is my cure for colds and here is my cure for measles
When you've tried those if you've invented your toes
This filthy old world is such a beautiful girl
That the world is so full of sin
Never look back on the things that you lack
My mother said that I should stay out of bed
But I know that I like it in there
It's coming on strong
It's coming on and on and on and
It's coming on strong
It's coming on and on and on and
I've got someone that I'd like you to hold
And my brother will tell you that it's good for your cold
Take my hand and we'll try to make a stand
That the world is so full of sin
Never look back on the things that you lack
My mother said that I should stay out of bed
But I know that I like it in there
Think of the days in so many ways we used to talk
And how we would love to sing
And that's what your love could bring
Don't think of me as something to see
I only have sunshine and love to bring
Somehow I feel there's something unreal
About the way money means everything
That'll be the fall of all of the worlds you love
Don't think of me as something to see
I only have sunshine and love to bring
Think of the days in so many ways we used to talk
And how we would love to sing
And that's what your love could bring
Think on the sunshine
Chance of a lifetime to come
You'll see there's diamonds in the skies
And a rainbow round your shoulder for all time
Think on the sunshine in your mind
There's a year in a day
And all the people you'll see
Will smile if you'll stay
Laugh and the whole world laughs with you
Worry and you'll all be in there trying too
It's always there in your mind
I'm searching there too
Don't lead the life they want you to
Think of your own and then go see it through
If you get on the road that takes you back
There's a lot of things you ought to know
You're going where I wanna be
If you get on the road you've got to take me
Can you see I don't care
I just want the chance to try
I stopped having dreams some time ago
So now it seems I have to show
If there's a chance I've got to find me
Somewhere there's someone who can see
Is all he has to show for love
Oh please help me please
Never knew the light could seem so bright
After all you choose you've got win or lose
I've got my pipe and I've got my song
And I've got love to keep me happy
It's no surprise I've got bleary eyes
But it's all that I have and it's all that I want
Many years ago I thought whenever it shows
I've got my coat and I've got my comb
And I'll dance to the light if he's chasing me home
I've got my pipe and I've got my song
And I've got love to keep me happy
It's no surprise I've got bleary eyes
After all this time it's got no better
And the words just seem to pass me by
So I think of you in the morning
Singing a song to fill my eyes
Something overcame me
Didn't want to go and pass you by
Blow and slip through your hand
All the breath within me
Leaving me gasping for some air
Hardly seem to matter
You were more than summer days
So much more than words can say
When the years are gone
And we live on memories
No matter where I could be
So much more than I don't know
So much more than words can say
Didn't want to leave you
Something pulling me back hurt me so
If you get on the road that takes you back
There's a lot of things you ought to know
You're going where I wanna be
If you get on the road you've got to take me
Can you see I don't care
I just want the chance to try
I stopped having dreams some time ago
So now it seems I have to show
If there's a chance I've got to find me
Somewhere there's someone who can see
Is all he has to show for love
Oh please help me please
Never knew the light could seem so bright
After all you choose you've got win or lose
I've got my pipe and I've got my song
And I've got love to keep me happy
It's no surprise I've got bleary eyes
But it's all that I have and it's all that I want
Many years ago I thought whenever it shows
I've got my coat and I've got my comb
And I'll dance to the light if he's chasing me home
I've got my pipe and I've got my song
And I've got love to keep me happy
It's no surprise I've got bleary eyes
I've got someone that I'd like you to hold
And my brother will tell you that it's good for your cold
Take my hand and we'll try to make a stand
That the world is so full of sin
Never look back on the things that you lack
My mother said that I should stay out of bed
But I know that I like it in there
Suck a sugar dandy Rock and Roll
Lick a licking lozenge cures the soul
Here is my cure for colds and here is my cure for measles
When you've tried those if you've invented your toes
This filthy old world is such a beautiful girl
That the world is so full of sin
Never look back on the things that you lack
My mother said that I should stay out of bed
But I know that I like it in there
It's coming on strong
It's coming on and on and on and
It's coming on strong
It's coming on and on and on and
I've got someone that I'd like you to hold
And my brother will tell you that it's good for your cold
Take my hand and we'll try to make a stand
That the world is so full of sin
Never look back on the things that you lack
My mother said that I should stay out of bed
But I know that I like it in there
And we'll be missing you but that's for me to care
Yes indeed that's what we need for everybody to sing
Wanna see you take you by the hand and do some mess around
Get you when nighttime comes along
And we'll be missing you but that's for me to care
Morning has come again
Another day seems surrounding me
Here comes that song again
With his arm round it seems to be guiding me
Sun here with a mirror for the day
Somewhere in your mind you'll hear someone say
I like the way you put a dream in my heart
I like the wind blowing in my ears
I like my days to have sunshine and stars
And no rain to appear
I'd give more for you than sunshine darling
Got love for you straight from my heart
All you've got to do is search your heart
Don't seem to matter if it's all in your mind
I'd still believe you right here
It seemed to dispel all fear
I do believe nothing could be so much better
The love I give to you is sunshine darling
Got love for you straight from my heart
In dreams of you I wish a song on everyone
Thunder songs of love to make you smile
I could have found as well at home as in the skies
There's so much time misspent in dreams of wealth and fame
When all you need is love in your eyes
Take a cup of newfound wealth
Drink it down into your soul
Let your feelings tell you why
Have no fear for lonely days
Mind in hand you'll find a way
You must believe me till you've tried
Take a cup of newfound wealth
Drink it down into your soul
Let your feelings tell you why
Have no fear for lonely days
Mind in hand you'll find a way
You must believe me till you've tried
Insomuch as we can tell
A shadow clears anew before me
And through our needs we'll tag along
Collecting thoughts for all the others
Someone you know very well passing you by
It's hard to tell what the world has got you by
Maybe one day will come to be a song
And all the world will seem so big and beautiful
Never know what it is but it goes on
Back with our love for a place in your heart
Unknown you don't see much so you must be a part of me
That's just the way I'd have you sung
Back with our love for a place in your heart
When we've done all the things that we said we could do
Back with our love for a place in your heart
Sometimes I'm thinking
The nights are always chilly
Streets outside are empty
Wisdom points a finger
See the spectacle within
Take your seats and in a moment
The curtain will rise
Presenting the show of our lives
The curtains draw slowly
The fanfare sounds true
The audience starts cheering
The spotlight's on you
As the scene grows before you
A performance we will not forget
For this is the show of our lives
The stage is still and silent
And yet we feel the glory
The show still goes on
So ring the bells and sing
Shout with all your hearts set
A performance we will not forget
For this is the show of our lives
Ring the bells and sing
Gather round and sing
Ring the bells and sing
Gather round and sing
Ring the bells and sing
Gather round and sing
Ring the bells and sing
Gather round and sing
Ring the bells and sing
Gather round and sing
Ring the bells and sing
I've seen days when it's all sunshine
I've stood days in the pouring rain
I'll fall over myself and sometimes
I'll get back on my feet again
So you got me all wrong
Don't ask when you know what I said
You can't do nothing wrong from right
If you come sleeping and passing my way
We'll go lazing around tonight
Don't get me all wrong
Don't get me all wrong
Don't get me all wrong
Don't get me all wrong
It's lonely and I need you near me
I don't believe it's over
I feel as if you never left
I need you to remind me
It's lonely and I need you near me
Now that it's done I can see
We've got it all back together
Sometimes it all seemed much better
Nobody ever to guide you
Always so easy just wanting to please with your eyes
Doing all with whatever
Don't know what lay down beside me
Slowly taking me over
Changing my mind without reason or rhyme from that goal
Oh I'd work it out slowly
Oh I'd take it as it comes
Oh I'd talk it all over
Oh shove it back where it comes
In my mind I can find
All I need for whatever
And as such don't need much
A million or two just in case I
Don't feel at ease and there's something it'd please me to find
Oh I'm working it slowly
Oh and I'll take it as it comes
Oh and I'll spread it all over
Oh shove it back where it comes
Don't you think it all stinks
Don't wait for someone to guide you
Maybe it won't seem much better
About people like you
I never really learned
About people like you
You changed my life around
You let me fall in love with you
It never really seemed
There would come the day
You changed my life around
You let me fall in love with you
You changed my life around
About people like you
I never really learned
About people like you
You changed my life around
Like pools within a pool and waves upon the sand
Their end like circles begins again
I can close my eyes and clearly see
Like flowing waters past the ripple stones of time
Under a bridge of peace of woods that don't forget
She stops and stares as if we've never met
Searching every hour of each day
Everything and nothing in my life wondering where you are
Now it really seems it's all a dream
All I want is all the life in me to be free
Oh the time has come to get things done
So play the rules and keep it cool
All I want is all the life in me to be free
All I want is all the life in me to be free
All I want is all the life in me to be free
All I want is all the life in me to be free
Searching every hour of each day
Everything and nothing in my life wondering where you are
You say there's things that you don't allow
If you can't take a gift from the horse's mouth
I want my money back right now
It really makes it seem so obscene
Paying for a piece of your dream
It's a business doing pleasure with you
I know that it's late but I just can't wait
It's a strange sight but have all you like
Just let me know when you're through
An orgy of pure blubber and flesh
Why they say you're six of the best
You say that it is bottom or bust
Whose service I can really trust
Ring the bells and sing
Gather round and sing
Ring the bells and sing
Gather round and sing
Ring the bells and sing
Gather round and sing
Ring the bells and sing
I've seen days when it's all sunshine
I've stood days in the pouring rain
I'll fall over myself and sometimes
I'll get back on my feet again
So you got me all wrong
Don't ask when you know what I said
You can't do nothing wrong from right
If you come sleeping and passing my way
We'll go lazing around tonight
Don't get me all wrong
Don't get me all wrong
Don't get me all wrong
Don't get me all wrong
You came back too late in better sunshine
Smiled like never before
But you know I got such a lazy feeling
I doubt if I saw you at all
Swollen right to the core
With a constitution of funny faces
And memories of her before
I was keeping back my love
And saved my time for you
And saving all my dreams for your heart
You may need somebody to make it better
Well you may be tall and you know it all
But I'm certain we'll show you a time
But there's no point leaving alone
If it makes you sick when you take your kicks
I was keeping back my love
And saved my time for you
Sometimes I'm thinking
The nights are always chilly
Streets outside are empty
Wisdom points a finger
When doing it all late at night
I feel a thousand faces
All looking at me pale and white
From most peculiar places
They seem to be full of life
Tell me that my life could be better
If all I want is love
My hands are holding traffic jams
That's full of crazy ladies
All trying to get home at the same time
To feed full fats of babies
And all they want is life
All they want is life to get better
With all the running times you've given me
I never did ask what I might have been
When I could see their faces
I could have stayed home and got stuck right in
Or gone a million places
But then I wanted life
All I wanted was life to get better
So I could feel your love
So I could say to you
Know what you can do with everything
Love need no shove to keep the life I lead so satisfying
It's not very clear to me
I happened along just to see
If there's anything new
And I don't want to be the one to argue
If there's a part to play
I'll play it in my way
And if you don't like what I say
My voice will just die away
And I don't want to be the one to argue
And you really must agree
You've got to be a Chief for one day
If you're an Indian for three
Tell you a game you must play
And the name's diplomacy
When you've got so many people to see
You can take your false confidence
And stick it where nobody can see
It's not very clear to me
I happened along just to see
If there's anything new
Thanking one once again you could hear him saying in that order now
Some said he's a little crazy
Maybe he's living in a haze
But you should see that boy fly
Can't bring myself to say what he's doing with the other
Twice in the afternoon he would come out with his head up in a cloud
His smile would send your senses reeling
From your toe jump to your head
And his breath would guarantee you see
That you would rather be dead
Though he may seem a little crazy
Distasteful to your eye
He may be living in a haze
But you should see that boy fly
Some said he's a little crazy
He'll change the expression on your face
For you I would change the day
Wrap it up and take it all away
Give the night to the morning
Let it ride on into the sky
You know you just came to see
Not what was right but what was wrong with me
And I got strength from your feeling
When you smiled you'd pass me on by
Lord knows I got a lack
So small you could hardly see
The amount of confusion
Leading all who'll pass life on by
Sometime when you're feeling low
We can take the time to get up and go
From this world to another
Lord knows I got a lack
Lord knows I got a lack
Lord knows I got a lack
Lord knows I got a lack
Lord knows I got a lack
Lord knows I got a lack
I had lost all the breath within me
As I went up on the hill
When there she was with a sad expression
And I can't find how to get some water
For your time I will reward you
How could I refuse a lady
There was I in a situation
With no one around to tell
So on that day I put some water
In the bucket by the well
When she smiled I felt her harder
But on the way I fell down
Right down the bottom
I didn't mind spilling all the water
If I'd satisfied myself
There the time didn't really matter
It could have been somebody else
Even though it cost a crown
But now I'll find my life is sweeter
Every time I fall down
Well on that day I put some water
In the bucket by the well
When she smiled I felt her harder
Right down the bottom
Right down the bottom
Right down the bottom
And even though it cost a crown
Now I'll find my life is sweeter
Living all the days when I was right in your eyes
Through all these dreams of something better
Let me know how you feel
I would hardly contrive to conceal
Many times before I've turned my back on the days
Out of one of gold it turned to silver
So the time to choose had come on down in a haze
Giving you and me a long forever
You may drown in your tears
Was ever a time you wouldn't mind
Oh only came by below recalling me
When it's going for me I'm gonna take what I like
When it's not I'll surely set for better
If I know I'm wrong I'm gonna make it all right
If it keeps you loving me forever
You may drown in my fears
Was ever a time you wouldn't mind
Well if I say to you I could forget it
Believing it out of lying
Until you came into my life
If I could do again I'd beg and borrow
For a second time around
But I wouldn't change my life by a single day
If I couldn't have you for dreaming of
Taking it all the way
Better than all after
Time to keep on loving still
Though you'll sometime disappear
All the seed I'd planted could be grown
Diving in all the way
Must admit we had much better than before
Better than all after
Time to keep on loving till
All alone and riding home while you'd always find me there
Till the feeling gets to you so strong that you can open up the skies
I saw you on the line
Between the worlds of fantasy and swollen girls
Never knew I'd see a better time
Taking it all the way
Better than all after
Time to keep on loving
Having it all the way
Better than all after
Time to keep on loving
Taking it all the way
Better than all after
Time to keep on loving
Having it all the way
Better than all after
Time to keep on loving
Having it all the way
Better than all after
Time to keep on loving
Taking it all the way
Better than all after
Time to keep on loving
Having it all the way
Better than all after
Time to keep on loving
Having it all the way
Better than all after
Trying to find me a lady
I'd be reeling up on a ceiling
Out of my mind forever
And I'm gonna come through searching for you
If it's keeping me straight up ahead
I ain't gonna take note and tell you all so
Trying to explain how they found me
The deep black eyes were no surprise
But all those dogs were beyond me
Then in the morning your toll we will see
Well it's what they all say when they gonna say
So don't keep on banging your head
And I'm gonna come through and I'll prove it to you
And I'm gonna come through searching for you
If it's keeping me straight up ahead
I ain't gonna take note and tell you all so
Was with no surprise I could feel his eyes
So I took my flight by the pale moonlight
That's what he told me before
So I kept going back there for more
If you don't leave it alone
He's gonna hound you all night
I could see no way I was gonna stay
With a man like that on my heel
He was six foot four and could eat a door
And his fists were like great blocks of steel
But his wife was rude and it seemed so good
To have fun while he was away
While he lived in hope of the sale of soap
Like the cat and the mouse we would play
If you don't leave it alone
He's gonna hound you all night
It was late that night when he came inside
I could see through the glass by the door
For his key had stuck and I praised my luck
As I dive from the bed to the floor
When I heard him yell like a bat from hell
I was out enough down the road
Was with no surprise I could feel his eyes
And imagine the gun that he'd load
He might hound me all night
Better to have tried than never
Than never to have tried at all
Maybe I'm a fool about you
Can tell there's no way I'm gonna stay
With then what else was so long
Easy to believe in nothing
Give it down and have a ball
Oh I got a love and I just want to let it grow
Oh I got a love and I just want to let it grow
Maybe I'm a fool about you
All around for too long
Bet you I will be loving you still
Well it's often bad around you
You and I must take it on trust
We're gonna carry on around
Wanna make love tonight
Oh let me hear the silver strings
Oh hear those violins and things
Oh when the music starts to play
You know it carries me away
Oh with a fiddle and a bow
You know there's places you can go
If you can just get there in tune
You know they never used to
You know they never used to
Listen when the fiddler starts to play
Now they clap their hands
Oh let me hear the silver strings
Oh hear those violins and things
Oh when the music starts to play
You know it carries me away
Fell all in love with a lady
Bad breath and drives a Mercedes
But oh she had such style
Looks that could kill you stone dead
Though I tried not to stare at the parts that were bare
It's cold in the street and it's hurting my feet
Ooh I could not tell you the thoughts that came into my head
When she and the girl took money and all and said
It's not quietened the fact of the funds that I lacked
Had to shop where I bought the equipment
But the shape of the suit and the size of her boots
Gave an impending sense of achievement
But oh to my surprise she tied herself onto the bed
Then with her toes in an indecent pose she said
She was smiling like a wheeler at the races
But the man in the car was just dreaming
Only the suit must have seen me
To fill up his tears with eyes
Saw her rocking like a mother typhoon
She could sway like the mother of a candle
Oh no she's gonna rock on me soon
But the man in the car was just dreaming
Only the suit must have seen me
To fill up his tears with eyes
I know I should have notified you
But it's gone and I fear her at the graces
And the man in the car was still dreaming
Holding his heart that's still bleeding
He couldn't believe his eyes
And the man in the car was still dreaming
Holding his heart that's still bleeding
Couldn't believe his eyes
Couldn't believe his eyes
Couldn't believe his eyes
Couldn't believe his eyes
I tried to sell the truth but I couldn't make it stand
And when you feel there's someone closing down on me
I'm going to myself just to see what I can see
And when the stars are right I'll come sailing right on by
Where the sun won't go wrong long as I
That you can see on you averted they have passed
Don't let them satisfy the need to tell you so
And when the four winds blow and you're feeling kinda small
Ooh you go into yourself and find a way ahead
It's very clear to me you're better off
You come on with a smile that comes sailing right on through
Wait till the stars above and the ground way down below
Showing me minor roads of varying cold
Making the world so young and me so old
Yours was a face I remember very well
Imagine how I feel when the face I saw was me
And your face is on the run
And your body's almost done
Well you won't have to notice anymore
Well you won't have to notice anymore
I fell from the right side into the dark
I did time with the Bullet Boys and I thought that really smart
Then you came to me with the smile on your face
Lights in your eyes and a sense of disgrace
Nobody knew it quite as well
Then you took me down with a flash and a grin
Showed me what it's all about and flew me back on in
Nobody knew it quite as well
It hits you like a thunderbolt right between the eyes
Nobody knew it quite as well
Nobody knew it quite as well
Saw you at the corner of me eye on second day
Wondered what I'd done wrong but I stayed there anyway
Saw you in the classroom and I saw you in the street
Knew your name and knew your face and landed on me feet
You were going out with someone I called me best friend
Saw you in the classroom and I saw you in the street
Knew your name and knew your face and landed on me feet
Saw you at the corner of me eye on second day
Wondered what I'd done wrong but I stayed there anyway
Saw you in the classroom and I saw you in the street
Knew your name and knew your face and landed on me feet
Think about the love that's lost when I'm all alone
Give a little thought to all the times that we had
Seems to me if you wanna be free
Then I'll have to let your loving go
Think about the love that's lost when I'm all alone
Give a little thought to all the times that we had
Seems to me if you wanna be free
Sound of scene where it often been of depression and despair
Yet no one heeds the tears in his eyes
No chorus as his spirit slowly dies
Yet no one heeds the tears in his eyes
No chorus as his spirit slowly dies
I just want to play my song
If only you would only listen
I'd be so happy if you all would sing along
I'd have the things that I've been missing
There's a lot to say if you wanna stay till tomorrow
Take the daily strain from upon your brain
And move around at ease
Give yourself a break from the same mistakes
Close the window now and breathe
Dance his roses out of the car
Cowboy cactus motor car
Photos of a movie star
We're walking down the golden mile
He says he's the only man around
Wait till you look into his eyes
He says he's the only man who cares
But that's just because he's scared
We're walking down the golden mile
This is the only sound around
Sounds like a fountain on the ground
He says he's the only man around
Wait till you look into his eyes
He says he's the only man who cares
Till the dawn comes again and the sunlight warms you
So with the warmth of desire that comes out of the glow
No disgrace can cause a shadow to rest on your face
And Heaven knows where it comes and where it all goes
And there is a bright shiny day waiting to be called
Don't spend your life on the wall
Living a love with a sad face
Somebody'll open your eyes
Then you'll be like a sunshine
For you are a bright shiny day come to take me back
Don't spend your life on the wall
Living a love with a sad face
Somebody'll open your eyes
Then you'll be like a sunshine
Don't spend your life on the wall
Living a love with a sad face
When I think of all my daydreams
When I think of all my fears
It's just as pure as glue
When I think of all my daydreams
When I think of all my fears
When I think of all my daydreams
When I think of all my tears
Fell out of a dream that nearly had me screaming at night all over the place
Gotta stay awake tonight boy
Gotta find a way to fight back
Gotta keep a line of decencies
Anymore but now it felt like my blow to a thousand pieces in the night
I fell from the right side into the dark
I did time with the Bullet Boys and I thought that really smart
Then you came to me with the smile on your face
Lights in your eyes and a sense of disgrace
Nobody knew it quite as well
Then you took me down with a flash and a grin
Showed me what it's all about and flew me back on in
Nobody knew it quite as well
It hits you like a thunderbolt right between the eyes
Nobody knew it quite as well
Nobody knew it quite as well
If you sail the world on a heartache
You'll live the life for the lonely road
Lost between the worlds of hate and sadness
But whichever way you see it now
It's gonna get you anyhow
When you lose someone you love
You gotta take it home before it breaks in two
Get it out before it gets to you
You know it's never too late
It's never too late to love
If we all get on the right line
If we all get in before the clouds
We can help each other stay in out of the cold
But you'll never know if you'll never try
If you wanna live or you wanna die
But then not know cause you know of a way to go
You know it's never too late
It's never too late to love
So take me into your arms
I'll give you my heart
Take my heart but don't you dare lose it
Or I'll come and get your body and soul
Take my heart but don't you dare lose it
Take me from this hard day
Take me from this hard day
Take me from this hard day
Take me from this hard day
Don't forget about the lonely road
And don't forget the worlds of hate and sadness
But whichever way you see it now
It's gonna get you anyhow
It's never too late to love
So take me into your arms
I'll give you my heart
Take me into your arms
I'll give you my heart
My mates and I are working days and sometimes nights
The bed and breakfast ladies are out all day
You've been around and still you find
You know I'm by where the drinks are cold
And then I'll look at you like you were old
You know that they can't help it
You gotta drink just to pass the time
She said she dreams of a life abroad
And then her husband is inside the fraud
You said you're no familiar call
But you wanna take advantage
Likely you just can't fail to answer the call
Well no one said I doubt old sun
I bet you wanna take it all
You gotta hand in the pale moonlight
You gotta hum it on alone
You think you'd better go on back to the bar
She says why don't you come and take a shower
You can't believe you look so far
Always say what I know when it's right
When I feel it in my heart
Heaven knows when the future will be
Not then when I start
Likely you just can't fail to answer the call
Well no one said I doubt old sun
I bet you wanna take it all
You said you never like the march of touch
And that you got up on a stroll approach
It's a perfect situation
And then she said she want it there then
You're sure you wanna start it in the den
If you recall you took it all
Makes it all so much better
And I wanna tell you I feel it in my heart
Makes it all so much better
You gotta take what you can tonight
You gotta stand before you're home
I'll never be sheltered
You gotta stand back against the wall
You gotta think what you had at all
You gotta tell them what they know
They do not already know
Got thirty miles to go to the next services
You won't believe the state my engine's in
I'm leaking oil and reckon I won't make it up the hill
I should have checked my fan belt too
Get to me as fast as you can
It's now well past four and pissing down with rain
They ain't had the very man to fix it
I'm down the road in my little red Marina in the rain
Connect me through to Information
I'm pumped right out and I've fifteen miles to walk home in the wet
Get to me as fast as you can
I'm down the road in my little red Marina in the rain
Connect me to Auto Information
I've conked right out and I've fifteen miles to walk home in the wet
Get to me as fast as you can
Every star that has died leaves a void
Now locked inside some reel of celluloid
Or understand the magic and the joy
Memory's all we've got
Memory's all we've got
Memory's all we've got
Memory's all we've got
Memory's all we've got
Memory's all we've got
Memory's all we've got
Memory's all we've got
Memory's all we've got
I just can't bear to see you so alone
You don't need to prove you're a star
Sally don't rearrange it
I'm so afraid I might forget my lines
I always say the wrong things all the time
You don't need to prove you're a star
Sally don't rearrange it
Sally you're a winner
Always been a dreamer
Sally you can be a star
Sally that's the way you are
And if we fall ascending every cloud
You don't need to prove you're a star
Sally don't rearrange it
You don't need to prove you're a star
Sally don't rearrange it
You don't need to prove you're a star
Sally don't rearrange it
You gotta do what you feel is alright when you never have the thought
When you count the cost of a heart that's lost and you're home again
What a way to begin in your day when your head feels like a saw
As you're falling and really trying to shout
While your heart is out on the quayside
You're still in bed on the floor
You're searching hard for excuses
As you're falling and really trying to shout
While your heart is lost at the station
You're still in bed on the floor
You're searching hard for excuses
Count the cost of a heart that's lost
There's a whole wide world at 4 o'clock in the morning
Didn't have no place to go
My heart was feeling like a stone
Sick and tired and all alone
Fingers running down my spine
Not a shape nor sound but coldness touching my face
I wasn't gonna hang around
My feet could hardly touch the ground
I could feel those eyes follow me everywhere
God I hope somebody's listening I need a friend
Oh I know I have to say
It's taking my breath away
It's taking my breath away
Well I must admit finally in the daylight
Never seems to be the same
They'll say it's drink that's gotten your brain
You'll think you'll maybe grow insane
But to prove it you would have to go back again
Better pray somebody's listening you'll need a friend
Oh I know you have to say
It's taken your breath away
Crawling through the senses are the voices from the darkness
Calling all the forces from beyond the other side
What I know of all this I could say in just one sentence
He was there the maniac before a madman and eccentric
Crazy people running scared from voices in the night
Well it all comes back to what you thought in the first place
Can't be wrong it must be right
When you know you're caught you got to put on a brave face
Trace your steps into the night
Searching for another fright
You will feel those eyes follow you everywhere
Better hope somebody's listening you'll need a friend
Oh I know you'll have to say
It's taking your breath away
It's taking your breath away
Oh you'll have to say
It's taken your breath away
It's taken your breath away
Something where you can earn some money for a change
There'll always be someone who's heard it all before
But back to front existence blinkers on your eyes
The look in your eyes
Nobody could be more surprised
Things could only get better
Too busy looking after mine
If you're always sticking to the letter
You'd better slow to make it all last
Whether we are right or we're wrong
Hold on to it forever
You could never choose
Or to light that fuse
But you lost the cure
Cause you know there isn't any other way
How to decide when or where
How can you ever be sure
How can you ever endure
You know you've gotta give in
This fight that you never can win
And you know you haven't got the money
I know that you'll find
A little piece of mind
Somewhere where they won't think that you are funny
If it moves too fast etc
After the feeling has gone some will say
You'll get along without me in much the same old way
Cause you got the strength to carry on
But there must be another way
I gotta dream that someday I will find
That all answers will come clear in my mind
And when that moment comes to me
That's when I want to be
Standing with you by my side
And I wonder where you are
And I wonder where you've been
And I wonder what we'll say
If we meet again someday
Will you find a corner somewhere in your heart
After the evening sun comes the rain
I see it clearly in my dreams
Exactly what this means
I'm waiting for this chance again
So I wonder where you are etc
After the feeling has gone some will say
I'll get along without you in much the same old way
But that's not the way I want to be
You know what you mean to me
And what I know I mean to you
Hold me I'm cold as ice
I need someone warm tonight
To chase away all of those lies
And keep me from all of my fears
So if I could just find a way
There's nothing that I wouldn't pay
To change my life just for a day
Knowing you'll always be near
When I take you in my arms
I know that this time the miracle of love
Will wash away all of my tears
Make the pain in my heart disappear
Nothing compares to the thought
Been outside myself so long
The chance to return may be gone
Well I couldn't blame anyone
For thinking that I couldn't care
So why don't you stand by me
You bring back the warmth that I feel
That's burning deep in my heart
I'll make sure everything special
I'll take care of all that you need
And wait for that miracle
To flow into our hearts
I can't wait for the moment
I was asked to stand on the front line
To make the numbers up
Will I never learn how to read signs
I should know just how
The same mistakes will be
Each time and every day
For this feat of clay
Living like a fool near the breadline
And now you're out of cash
Well keep your beady eyes
I know where you've been
I know what you've seen
I can tell by the way that you're taking
Stay where I can see you
That your favorite taste is sour grape
Well I don't care for it
And I don't want any part of your bullshit
I've done what's asked and more
And now you're saying
I've done this times before
Just sign on the dotted line and
How many times must we fall
For the same old lies
Sooner or later we must know
Before we're all out of time
Get yourself a life because yours sucks
But not on my expense
You should build a wall and a high fence
And stay away from me
Stay where I can see you
Don't you know you're a poor sad bastard
You know your name is mud
Will you see me again
Though I know it's no use
I get tempted at the slightest excuse
But I don't want love
A fine line is drawn once again
You came to me like a total obsession
And stole into my heart
With a full blown obsession
If I mean to make a new start
The last thing I wanted
Was to cause any trouble
And I don't want to cause any pain
But each time I try to sort out the problem
It just comes round once again
Something deep inside of my heart helps me
Builds me up and keeps it apart until we start
I catch my mind on a vision of you
A smile from another place
And I remember the memories held within
And I know what I see is your face
Waiting here like a thief in the night
I can never believe what the hell I came here for
I catch my eye on the stain on the wall
A stain from another day
And I remember the memories held within
And I don't know what to say
Tell me why we lead our lives like this
Why there must be a reason
Why we steak another's kiss
When it's clearly just not the season
So I'll hold our love in the palm of my hand
Welcome like the rain
I'll watch it drift away like the sand through the
If I had only though about you when I was
I might never have fallen for someone else and it
Would never have come down to this
For someone that was jumping in my overalls
Oh I can see everything
But I still don't know where you are
So I'll keep on searching deep in my heart
See if we can make a new start
And if I can find a way
I catch my eye on a vision of you
A smile from another day
And I'll dream of the memories held within
And I don't know what to say
And I don't know what to say
And I don't know what to say
A robot on a snowmobile out there
Undiagnosed for years
Narwhals don't believe in Unicorns
Polar bears never will
Don't believe all those lies
My love is honest and true
Don't believe all those lies
I love nobody but you
Don't believe all those lies
I love nobody but you
With you by my side we can make it okay
There's a way of love with you and I'm seeing the glow
Burdens of this life have me in a trance
You can help unlock my other secrets
Though your warm embrace I'll give the good life a chance
There's a way of love with you and I'm feeling it flow
All I need is understanding just to let me grow
Just a little tighter
I don't have to fight it
I don't want to sound like I'm full of self pity
All I need for now is your love to forget her
Love so sweet completely setting me free
There's a way of love with you and I'm seeing the glow
Just a little tighter
I don't have to fight it
Just a little tighter
I don't have to fight it
I don't have to fight it
I don't have to fight it
Why don't you try it baby
My nights were getting better
The feeling of peace I had
Free to fill my space with
Things I really wanted
Dinner in a one night stop
Just meet me in the hall
Take a number in my black book
Then I saw a bright face
Sitting in the bar alone
She filled the whole place
The magic of her presence
Who would ever dare to give
Thought my nights were getting better
Just living by myself
But I got hooked this time
You know they all want to share your sweet stuff
After they've walked all over you
I'm the one who dries your lonely tears
Seeking out that same kind of charm
When you gonna realize you're only a token
Don't want to cause no serious alarm
But when the pressure gets to more than you can bear
And when you need to have a little real fun
Just count on me to be the one
I got a few things I want to say to you
Always believed I could get what I wanted
Even if it took a little while
Always believed I could take care of my brother
Do my thing with style
Sometimes arrive a little late
People tell me a shouldn't wait
Get just where they want to be
There have been times when I wanted to break my mold
Switch over to another street
Seeing others cruise on by
Am I the kind who would run over my brother
Am I the kind to be content in my splendor
I've spend too many empty nights
Wait for you to touch me and make it right
Don't you still feel the love I feel
That I need her to lay
I've watched you all through your busy day
The look in your eyes says you're far away
The love he pretended he just didn't mean
That I need her to lay
The moment I saw her lovely face
I had to convince the girl to stay
She filled me with love to overflow
I just can't bear to let her go
That I need her to lay
Make her give our love another day
Don't let her throw what we once had away
Bring her back into my once happy dream
Don't let him take her away from me
Don't let her say goodbye
It's like I'm sailing on the ocean
Every time I see your eyes
You could be the wind that keeps me floating
I could be in Heaven for all I know
Heaven's the place for me to go
No one ever could have told me how
No one ever could have told me how
Heaven could be here on earth
I know your heart is very tender
Your soft touch the breeze of life
In your arms I feel a comfort
I surrender in your smile
Hold me close for just a while
No one ever could have told me how
No one ever could have told me how
Heaven could be here on earth
Heaven's here on earth
The gentle waves of love in motion
And the warmth of summer sun
In your love I need no compass
My direction has begun
No one ever could have told me how
No one ever could have told me how
Heaven could be here on earth
Heaven could be here on earth
I have found a Heaven here on earth
Heaven's here on earth
You invite me to pick up my award
After all the time I've been out here
My music is still the same
My music said what I had to say
We thought you wanted to be a star
You worked so hard to get this far
You played all the small time scenes
We just wanted to fulfill your dreams
Don't think I want to be bothered at all
Maybe I'll just give them a call
I won't go through pomp and circumstance
You invite me to share my fame
I've decided not to play your game
We thought you wanted to be a star
We thought you wanted to be a star
We thought you wanted to be a star
We thought you wanted to be a star
We thought you wanted to be a star
We thought you wanted to be a star
Sat in the park just the other day
Saw little children about their way
The innocence mirrored in a little face
Took me back far away
Remembered when I was about that small
Running and playing was my big concern
It took a while taking in it all
I can see mom and dad and the house we had
The trees in the yard and how dad worked so hard
The good times we shared and how much they cared
All they did to make us grow
You put me out of your life with nowhere to go
Of the love that you told me had died
Now you want me to come back to you
Don't take it so hard girl and don't make me choose
All my chances for freedom to fly
In between my new romances
I'm just a man on my own
Out in the world all alone
Now you want me to start over again
You made me lose my freedom to fly
You know I'm gonna have it my way
I'm just a man on my own
Out in the world all alone
Now you want me to start over again
Don't ask her she's mine
Don't ask her she's mine
She would be yours for tonight
Don't ask her she's mine
She would do anything to get to me
Don't ask her she's mine
She'll tell you different but she ain't free
The girl can't help it if she can't be true
She tries my patience every once in a while
Don't ask her she's mine
Let me supply all the love she needs
The bitch can't help it if she can't be true
She tries my patience every once in a while
I need to tell you why I been unhappy
It's been too long on my mind
Got to admit you were there when I needed
Still there's something I gotta find
Maybe I need it too much
I've outgrown your love
No one's replacing you
I need some time on my own
Though it's not love I'm trying to find
It could be the freedom without you I'm needing
You took me for granted I found
And maybe I needed too much
No one's replacing you
If you believe all that you hear
You won't believe that love lasts through the tears
I'll have the memories
Gotta admit you were there when I needed
Still there's something I gotta find
And maybe I needed too much
No one's replacing you
I need some time on my own
I've outgrown your love
No one's replacing you
I need some time on my own
I've outgrown your love
No one's replacing you
Somebody said all things will pass
All things will pass away
It seems kinda slow and somehow I know
I'm gonna spend one more night alone
I'm gonna spend one more night alone
You found somebody new
And I can't believe it's true
Now ain't you lonely too
Lord I miss being with you
Don't want to spend one more night alone
One more night don't want to spend
Makes me feel so weak that I can hardly stand
If I only knew what you do to me
Knowing where I stand but that was long before
You got through with me
Don't let me go down in flames
If I only knew what you do to me
Wish I could do to you what you do to me
Keep on driving me wild
Keeps on driving way up to the sky
If I only knew what you do to me
Wish I could do to you what you do to me
If I only knew what you do to me
Wish I could do to you what you do to me
A yellow ribbon in her hair
I can't get you out of my mind
I took one look and I was fractured
I tried to walk but I was lame
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
I can't get you out of my mind
I tried to follow her all the way home
I can't get you out of my mind
Heard you say that you didn't like the state that the world is in
Not a day passes that your faith in man don't get mighty grim
You say you want to have piece of mind
You tell me that you find life is much too unkind
But who else can you blame for the state of your mentality
You say you want to have piece of mind
You tell me that you think life is much too unkind
You want to settle back into the old days of serenity
You know you can go on from here
Dim the past your future's clear
You say you want to have piece of mind
You tell me that you find life is much too unkind
But who else can you blame for the state of your mentality
You will not get a thing for a dime
You struggle through the passion the greed and the crime
But who else can you blame for the state of your mentality
You say you want to have piece of mind
You tell me that you find life is much too unkind
But who else can you blame for the state of your mentality
You say you want to have piece of mind
You tell me that you find life is much too unkind
But who else can you blame for the state of your mentality
Come on and catch up to the music anyway
Make your mind up today
Give me about an hour
I just wanna groove and hear your song
Let's take a little bit of time now
Can't rush to get it on
Gotta play this game to last
We can rock it tonight
Everything is going just right
It's time to rock and roll and let it all come out
That's what it's all about
I got you under the spell
It's not too early to tell
Give me about an hour
I just wanna groove and hear your song
Let's take a little bit of time now
Can't rush to get it on
Gotta play this game to last
Everything is going just right
It's coming right on time
It's not too early to tell
It's not too early to tell
It's not too early to tell
It's not too early to tell
It's not too early to tell
It's not too early to tell
It's not too early to tell
We toy with love but we play the futile game
One heart giving all and the other feeling pain
From this moment on I make no demands
What us the sense in giving all you feel
If with it all you can't make love know it's real
I put myself into your hands
If I could talk to love
Don't ask me if I love you more than anyone else
When you talk about love I can't always trust myself
Give me a little time
Can't always have you on my mind
Give me a little space
Can't always have you on my case
We've been through this same old scene many times before
Seems to me that you'd learn a lesson and you'd know by now
Give me a little time
Can't always have you on my mind
Give me a little space
Don't always want you on my case
Give me a little time
Can't always have you on my mind
Give me a little space
Don't want you always on my case
Give me a little time
Can't always have you on my mind
Give me a little space
Don't always want you on my case
Give me a little time
Can't always have you on my mind
Give me a little space
Days when the sun is so clear and bright
A dream that's as real as the stars in the night
A heart that can heal when you love in vain
A friend who can hold you through all of the pain
I wish you hope through your share of tears
I wish you peace all your living years
When the moon is high
The wisdom to trust in somebody else
The strength to believe most of all in yourself
Wish you hope through your share of tears
I wish you peace all your living years
When the moon is high
Someone to stay with you wrong or right
Someone to love every breath of your life
One wild childhood scheme
A dream we built in the soft sand
I love you still like a brother
A voice soars to the night
And a million hearts take flight
But you're not there in the spotlight
I love you still like a brother
I will wait till then
There is a light filling the dark
That shines across your pillow and pierces my heart
Pick up the phone holding you tight
But I don't know your number that'll bring you home tonight
You say you're coming
But I need something more than talk
Look at the sun alone in the sky
I know it shines upon you across the lonely miles
But when it is gone the night is so cold
The light across your pillow is nothing I can hold
You say you're coming
But I need something more than talk
Don't keep me wondering
Give me something more than talk
Now you say you're coming
But I need something more than talk
Don't keep me wondering
Give me something more than talk
I hurt so many hearts
And even my own could not escape
And now I've finally learned
And now the world has turned
And when I took your hand
I thought we found wonderland
But it's me who changed
And now I've finally learned
And now the world has turned
That lonely ends where love begins
You don't have to speak
And now I've finally learned
And now the world has turned
I wake up in the planet's dawn
To find you here beside me
Through the blinds the bands of light
Throw circles round your hair
The passion of the here and now
The sweet taste of the coming
On your lips and in my heart
So naked and so honest
Children laughing in the street
The world grows underneath our feet still yearning
Flowers bursting through concrete
And everything keeps turning
Leaders rise and soldiers fall
But gravity will take us all
This moment's where I'll stay
This love is mine today
Let me tell you something about myself
And I don't talk too easily
That scented room on the nineteenth floor
Short stories on cordless phones
I quit smoking but drink too much
Don't try and analyze me
Found a smile inside my life
Now nothing feels so frightening
Children laughing in the street
The world grows underneath our feet still yearning
Flowers bursting through concrete
And everything keeps turning
Leaders rise and soldiers fall
But gravity will take us all
This moment's where I'll stay
This love is mine today
This is love is mine today
And down on the darkest street
The day is waiting to begin
So draw back the curtains now
And let the love come rushing in
Children laughing in the street
The world grows underneath our feet still yearning
Flowers bursting through concrete
And everything keeps turning
Leaders rise and soldiers fall
But gravity will take us all
This moment will not fade
This moment's where I'll stay
You know they all want to share your sweet stuff
But what you gonna do about me
After they've walked all over you
I'm the one who dries your lonely tears
So what you gonna do about me
Baby what you gonna do about the one who really loves you
Sugar what you gonna do about the one who wants you only
How long do you think I can keep on waiting here
Seeking out that same kind of charm
When you gonna realize you're only a token
Don't want to cause no serious alarm
But when the pressure gets to more than you can bear
And when you need to have a little real fun
Just count on me to be the one
Baby what you gonna do about the one who really loves you
Sugar what you gonna do about the one who wants you only
Go back to my place you can let your hair down
I got a few things I want to say to you
Baby what you gonna do about the one who really loves you
Sugar what you gonna do about the one who wants you only
I find so much there to lean on
Our now and forevers are gone
Our now and forevers are gone
It's good to feel counted upon
Our now and forevers are gone
Those dancing days are gone
All the silk and satin gear
Wrapping that foul body up
I carry the sun in a golden cup
The moon in a silver bag
I carry the sun in a golden cup
The moon in a silver bag
Curse as you may I sing it through
What matter if the knave
That the most could pleasure you
The children that he gave
Are somewhere sleeping like a top
I carry the sun in a golden cup
The moon in a silver bag
I carry the sun in a golden cup
The moon in a silver bag
I thought it out this very day
Who leans upon a stick
I carry the sun in a golden cup
If I make the lashes dark
And the eyes more bright
And the lips more scarlet
Or ask if all be right
From mirror after mirror
I'm looking for the face I had
Before the world was made
What if I look upon a man
As though on my beloved
And my blood be cold the while
Why should he think me cruel
I'd have him love the thing that was
Would you meet your love
In the twilight with his greyhounds
Bribe the birds then on the branches
Bribe them to be dumb
Stare the hot sun out of heaven
That the night may come
Starless are the nights of travel
Bleak the winter wind
Run with terror all before you
Run until you hear the ocean's
Deep though it may be and bitter
You must drink it dry
Wear out patience in the lowest
Searching through the stranded shipwrecks
Dread guard with a kiss
Cross the rotten bridge that totters
There stands the deserted castle
Cross the silent empty ballroom
Doubt and danger past
Blow the cobwebs from the mirror
Put your hand behind the wainscot
You have done your part
Find the penknife there and plunge it
I felt my life with both my hands
I held my spirit to the Glass
I turned my Being round and round
And paused at very pound
But we might learn to like the Heaven
Promise me no promises
So will I not promise you
Keep we both our liberties
Never false and never true
Free to come as free to go
For I cannot know your past
Warmer towards another one
Who shall show us if it was
Fades the image from the glass
And the fortune is not told
For lost liberty again
I should fret to break the chain
Let us be the friends we were
Nothing more but nothing less
Many thrive on frugal fare
There is a wind where the rose was
Cold rain where sweet grass was
And clouds like sheep
Stream o'er the steep
Grey skies where the lark was
Your ghost where your face was
Sad winds where your voice was
If you were coming in the Fall
I'd brush the Summer by
If I could see you in a year
And put them each in separate Drawers
I'd count them on my Hand
And done with this desire
With memory to share my bed
And peace to share my fire
I'll comb my hair in scalloped bands
Beneath my laundered cap
And watch my cool and fragile hands
Lie light upon my lap
And I will have a sprigged gown
With lace to kiss my throat
I'll draw my curtain to the town
And hum a purring note
And I'll forget the way of tears
Followed ever the natural bents
I loved them until they loved me
Decked in garments of sable hue
Daubed with ashes of myriad Lents
Wearing shower bouquets of rue
Walk I ever in penitence
Through God's acre of memory
Marching columns of dead events
Ever a prey to coincidence
Always knew I the consequence
Always saw what the end would be
I loved them until they loved me
At last the secret is out
As it always must come in the end
The delicious story is ripe to tell
To tell to the intimate friend
The tongues has its desire
There's never smoke without fire
Behind the corpse in the reservoir
Behind the ghost on the links
Behind the lady who dances
And the man who madly drinks
Under the look of fatigue
The attack of migraine and the sigh
There is always another story
There is more than meets the eye
For the clear voice suddenly singing
High up in the convent wall
The scent of the elder bushes
The sporting prints in the hall
The croquet matches in summer
There is always a wicked secret
Just remember darling
You'll be lonesome too
When its wet with rains
Till you're home again
Or until I come home to you
Sans Christ et sans Allah
And ever fall in love with
You'd probably walk around the block
To wish you happiness
Is like a Christmas card
You throw it in the yard
Well I once knew love
Well I got so much love
Say you drive a Chevy
You say you drive around the town
Till you just get bored
Then you change your mind
For something else to do
And your heart gets bored with your mind
Well it's a doggone shame
And it's an awful mess
Pierce right through me
They can only do harm
Words are meaningless
They can only do harm
They can only do harm
Police walked in for Jimmy Jazz
Bad acting at the curtain fall is nothing new
Those little things that never leave a clue
If nothing but the best means nothing much to you
One little thing that just won't let you choose
Those little things that never leave a clue
Once I lived the life
Took all my friends out
Bought bootleg whiskey
Till that eagle grins
Everybody wants to be
Never mind about the tune and sing along
I believe you'll be the greatest on the show
Make believe everyone will stare
Never mind about the tune and sing along
I believe you'll be the greatest on the show
I'm done how to play it cool
Never mind about the tune and sing along
I believe you'll be the greatest on the show
Lately you've been working too hard.
The joy that lights the fire.
I'll stay until the sun comes
Till the sun comes down.
Don't go out with the boys tonight
I won't sleep a wink wondering what you're doing
Don't go out with the girls tonight
I will turn to drink wondering who you're screwing
Don't go out with the boys tonight
I won't sleep a wink wondering what you're doing
Don't go out with the girls tonight
I will turn to drink wondering who you're screwing
Don't go out with the boys tonight
I won't sleep a wink wondering what you're doing
Don't go out with the girls tonight
I will turn to drink wondering who you're screwing
Comes crashing down around me.
Anywhere that I am going.
Money and the money and the egos
Money and the money and the ego.
Only you can get me going.
Sometimes it's hard to see
All the people around me going for
Money and the money and the egos
I need to know before I try
I've got to be sure there's more than
Money and the money and the ego
Giving up is all you've got
And giving up all you want
Stay in there for hours.
Comes crashing down around me.
Money and the money and the egos
Money and the money and the ego.
You've got a face that just don't show what's going on inside
I finally come knocking and I've been here before
If you can hear me then tell me
If you want this love to walk away
Tell me and I'll say goodbye
I finally come knocking and I've been here before
I'm begging you to tell me
You deny the other side of me that strips good love away
And you kissed my mirror reflection when I looked at me today
When you look at me the way you do my fingers tingle
I can't breathe until we're skin on skin
When you look at me the way you do my life moves in perfect motion
You're doing all the heavy lifting
Just decided that I'd like to side with you oh every time
When you look at me the way you do my fingers tingle
I can't breathe until we're skin on skin
When you look at me the way you do my life moves in perfect motion
You're doing all the heavy lifting
Look at me the way you do
When you look at me the way you do my fingers tingle
I can't breathe until we're skin on skin
When you look at me the way you do my life moves in perfect motion
You're doing all the heavy lifting
Look at me the way you do
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high
If I had a day that I could give you
I would give a day sure to make you smile
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine almost always makes me high
If I had a day that I could give you
I would give you a day just like today
And if I had a song that I could sing for you
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine almost always makes me high
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
I think that I've been going about this the wrong way
I've been swept up in my own concerns
I want to climb that cedar tree and leave me in good hands
I've been swept up in my own concerns
I'm not gonna stop you
And it's dribbling like honey
Stakes are getting higher
It costs if you're the buyer
Slide me through your
Slide me through your
The sweetest dreams you ever had
Make your early morning not so bad
I like what you've done with the place
Your gingerbread and that
Greedy smile upon your face
Slide me through your
Slide me through your
And I'll give you the sweetest dreams you ever had
Make your early morning not so bad
I say get it over with
Don't you ask for more
That wave just tumbles me round
Baby I just can't make a sound
But I've already been through this
I survive on hotel shampoos
You've gone away again
Gone to collect some more
Your hands pressed hard into me
I thought this summer you'd be
Ooh he's gone away again
We were dream chasers baby
Skyscrapers are not too tall
He's gonna prove me right till I'm wrong
Craving all the gold and the riches
I don't want to wash my own dishes
Driving in a sweet brand new car
Living the life of a superstar
We were dream chasers baby
Skyscrapers are not too tall
He's gonna prove me right till I'm wrong
He don't recognize us
In all our pretty disguises
In all our pretty disguises
Oh we work hard until we're sleeping
And we sleep but we're not dreaming
Oh we sleep but we're not dreaming
He's gone away from me
We were dream chasers baby
Skyscrapers are not too tall
He's gonna prove me right till I'm wrong
I know he'll prove me right
Oh I'm so tangled up in my
The weight was too much to carry in
Mr. Don't Look So Scared
That I could be so sad
I've been very cautious
Trying numbness instead of pain
The weight was too much to carry in
Mr. Don't Look So Scared
That I could be so sad we went under
I regret the pink stilettos
Sour candy... endings...
And I was barely even there.
The weight was too much to carry in
Mr. Don't Look So Scared
That I could be so sad... so sad... so sad... so sad...
I threw a wish in the well
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way
And all the other boys try to chase me
You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
I beg and borrow and steal
I didn't know I would feel it
And all the other boys try to chase me
And all the other boys try to chase me
Just to watch it bleed
Just so I can please you
I can't stand the way you're smiling
You know it's up to me
But curiosity will never let me go
Left here in the corner
I really tried to warn her
Walked the streets all night
Until you came around
Knew that you would come before you ever even made a sound
You know it's up to me
But curiosity will never let me go
So don't break me tonight
I'm gonna follow you home
I'm gonna follow you home
And you know I'm going to follow you...
Well I think that we should try it out to see yeah
So don't break me tonight
I'm gonna follow you home
I'm gonna follow you home
I could take a picture
Of you and me together
No one would believe me
No one would believe me
That baby it don't get much better
And I will pick the city
If you're asking if I'd really like to see you again
Tell me that you feel it
This you and me together
No one would believe me
Even I cannot believe it
You kiss me like you mean it
Darling just say when
And I will pick the city
If you're asking if I'd really like to see you again
I say oh... just say when
I thought they'd keep us apart
And I will pick the city
I could take a picture
Of you and me together
No one would believe me
That's why I take my time
Well I'm in if you're in
Let's make a big mistake
Can't you see I'm burning up
When you look like that
And I'm looking right back
Why don't you talk to me
When he's singing his song
Well all the young girls sigh
And we'll be wearing those things
That make a grown man cry
Let's make a big mistake
Can't you see I'm burning up
When you look like that
And I'm looking right back
Why don't you talk to me
I've been yours from the start
I'll be your summer heart
I've been yours from the start...
When it's love like that
And you look like that
Can't you see I'm burning up
When you look like that
And I'm looking right back
I've been yours from the start
I'll be your summer heart
I've been yours from the start
Can't you see I'm burning up
When you look like that
And I'm looking right back
Why don't you talk to me talk to me
In the space between the words
In the silence of your eyes
In the hands that know the touch
It's the way I feel inside
Dancing cross this floor together
With every step I take I seem to want you more than ever
I'll never let you down
And I'll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
I'll never let you down
And I'll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
It's the beating of your heart
It's the tear I have to hide
It's the sound of your guitar
It's the way I feel inside
Dancing cross this floor together
With every step I take I seem to want you more than ever
I'll never let you down
And I'll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
I'll never let you down
And I'll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
If you need a shoulder
Or someone to hold you
I'll keep my arms open wide
I'll be the one who loves you
I'll be right there by your side
Dancing cross this floor together
With every step I take I seem to want you more than ever
I'll never let you down
And I'll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
I'll never let you down
And I'll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
In the space between the words
In the silence of your eyes
In the hands that know the touch
Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
Feather cannons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
Now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's clouds illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and ferris wheels
When every fairy tale comes true
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
And if you care don't let them know
Don't give yourself away
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's loves illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say I love you right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads
They say I've changed
Well somethings lost and somethings gained in living every day
I've looked at life from both sides now
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and loose and still somehow
I really don't know life
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's clouds illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Tell me how you feel about it
Ask me for the truth about it
And I wish we could be holding hands
I wish we could be holding hands
How do you think it goes
With those tiny little bows
You're the one I want
You're the one I know
And everywhere you are
Is a place I wanna go
How do you think it goes
With those tiny little bows
You're the one I want
You're the one I know
And everywhere you are
Is a place I wanna go
Do you ever think about us
Call me if you think about it
I wish we could be holding hands
I wish we could be holding hands
How do you think it goes
With those tiny little bows
You're the one I want
You're the one I know
And everywhere you are
Is a place I wanna go
How do you think it goes
With those tiny little bows
You're the one I want
You're the one I know
And everywhere you are
Is a place I wanna go
Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart
How do you think it goes
With those tiny little bows
You're the one I want
You're the one I know
And everywhere you are
Is a place I wanna go
How do you think it goes
With those tiny little bows
You're the one I want
You're the one I know
And everywhere you are
Is a place I wanna go
I wish we could be holding hands
I went out last night
I'm going out tonight again
And she's a real sweet girl
And you know I got a boy
And you always know where I am
We're taking it way too far
But I don't want it to end
Your lips are undeniable
Your heart is unreliable
Something so sentimental
You make so detrimental
I don't wanna miss this kiss
You know you're just my type
And your eyes are lock and key
And you're a real hot thing
But you know I've got a boy
And you're dancing to where I am
But I don't want it to end
Your lips are undeniable
Your heart is unreliable
Something so sentimental
You make so detrimental
You lean in closer and I shouldn't or shouldn't I
I couldn't I shouldn't
I shouldn't I shouldn't
don't want to miss this kiss
Your lips are undeniable
Your heart is unreliable
Something so sentimental
You make so detrimental
I wish it didn't feel like this
I threw a wish in the well
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way
And all the other boys try to chase me
You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
I beg and borrow and steal
I didn't know I would feel it
And all the other boys try to chase me
And all the other boys try to chase me
Just to watch it bleed
Just so I can please you
I can't stand the way you're smiling
You know it's up to me
But curiosity will never let me go
Left here in the corner
I really tried to warn her
Walked the streets all night
Until you came around
Knew that you would come before you ever even made a sound
You know it's up to me
But curiosity will never let me go
So don't break me tonight
I'm gonna follow you home
I'm gonna follow you home
And you know I'm going to follow you...
Well I think that we should try it out to see yeah
So don't break me tonight
I'm gonna follow you home
I'm gonna follow you home
You're walking closer
And it's hard to breathe
But the heart's naive
And I expect too much
I left a scar that no one else can see
And now you're back here and reminding me
That I lost way too much
Do you know that night I almost said I loved you
And you almost said it back
Are we gonna be more than a memory
No matter how lame my apology
Are we gonna be more than a memory
Are you gonna just stand in front of me
Pretending I'm not your destiny
Are we gonna be more than a memory
Are we gonna be more than a memory
Cause no one else can say it quite the same
It takes me back to your September days
I've missed you way too much
If I was cruel to you
Well just to hear it breaks my heart in two
If there's a way to make it up to you
I wanna change so much you know I do
And you know that night I almost said I loved you
And you almost said it back
Are we gonna be more than a memory
No matter how lame my apology
Are we gonna be more than a memory
Are you gonna just stand in front of me
Pretending I'm not your destiny
Are we gonna be more than a memory
I really need to hear you breathe
Lay your body next to me
Are we gonna be more than a memory
No matter how lame my apology
Are we gonna be more than a memory
Are you gonna just stand in front of me
Pretending I'm not your destiny
Are we gonna be more than a memory
I don't know what I'm after
Now that you're just a friend
I can't call you and ask you
And from the very first time I saw your face
I knew I was satisfied
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
And how's it gonna be
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
And how's it gonna be
Turn me on and on and on
And I know what you're after
But you're reading me wrong
And I know what you're after
But you're reading me wrong
And from the very first time I saw your face
I knew I was satisfied
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
And how's it gonna be
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
And how's it gonna be
Turn me on and on and on
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
And how's it gonna be
Turn me on and on and on
When you smile like a tease
Baby you don't even know
When my heart skips a beat
But when you walk into the room
I can't speak and I can't move
You don't see me but you should
Why you gotta make it hurt so good
I don't ever wanna let you go
We could take it fast or make it slow
I'm the friend that you misunderstood
Why you gotta make it hurt so good
All the girls on the block
They come knocking at your door
You just stare out the window
But is it too late or too soon
I'm right outside here wanting you
You don't see me but you should
Why you gotta make it hurt so good
I don't ever wanna let you go
We could take it fast or make it slow
I'm the friend that you misunderstood
Why you gotta make it hurt so good
Inside a dream I built for two
When you walk into the room
I can't speak and I can't move
You don't see me but you should
Why you gotta make it hurt so good
I don't ever wanna let you go
We could take it fast or make it slow
I'm the friend that you misunderstood
Why you gotta make it hurt so good
I wonder where you are
And if you think of me
You know I had it rough
But the more that I look around
You're all I'm looking for
What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are
It's how you take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say
The beginning or the end
When we're on our own
It's like you're the other half of me
Nothing in the world compares
To the feelings that we share
What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are
You're not trying to be perfect
You try to take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say
I was running from myself
I was scared it's destiny
But it hurts like hell
Hope it's not too late
What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are
You're not trying to be perfect
It's how you take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say
I wanna smash your fears
And get drunken off your tears
Don't you share your smile with anyone else but me
I wanna touch your heart
I wanna crush it in my hands
Make you plead and cry as you give up all the lies
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Stuck in a real bad dream
And man it feels so new to me
It's been a real hard night
And I just hold my pillow tight
It won't love me back
No it's not you and I
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
You were here and then you left
Now they're all just second best
You're a bird in the water
I'm a fish on the ground
Oh won't you hold me down tonight
But if you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it like it's a wedding ring
Wrapped around my finger
You play my heartstrings
If you cut a piece of guitar string
This is the real thing
Wrapped around my finger
You play my heartstrings
You're a bird in the water
I'm a fish on the ground
Oh won't you hold me down tonight
But if you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it like it's a wedding ring
Wrapped around my finger
You play my heartstrings
If you cut a piece of guitar string
This is the real thing
Wrapped around my finger
You play my heartstrings
You're in the country
You're a bird in the water
I'm a fish on the ground
And I hope you hear me
If you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it like it's a wedding string
Wrapped around my finger
If you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it like it's a wedding ring
Wrapped around my finger
You play my heartstrings
If you cut a piece of guitar string
This is the real thing
Wrapped around my finger
You gave my shirt back
I don't really get the meaning
It's like you're giving up
Before it all goes wrong
But I don't really like the feeling
I've been away too long
You say love's a fragile thing
Made of glass but I think
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle
Try for me just a little longer
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle
It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle
It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle
If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it will light up your eyes
We spend the night alone together
You're a real good listener
But you don't have much to say
I hope we're still OK
You say love's a fragile thing
Made of glass but I think
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle
Try for me just a little longer
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle
It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle
It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle
If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it will light up your eyes
If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it will light up your eyes
You say love's a fragile thing
Made of glass but I think
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle
Try for me just a little longer
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle
It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle
It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle
If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
So drive so fast baby through the night
Ooh I don't care about my lipstick
Laughing at me in your head
With my teasing games
So drive so fast baby through the night
Ooh I don't care about my lipstick
Ooh I don't care about my lipstick
The things you're making me do
Ooh I don't care about my lipstick
Ooh I don't care about my lipstick
You got your way with me now didn't ya
Things you do are things we've done before
Don't you be looking at me darling with your sneaky eyes
Sometimes when I'm lonely I close my eyes
Some nights when I can't sleep I fantasize
Hard to believe that you're right here tonight
I'm going out of my mind
I think this could be the one night
I give in to this fight
Cause you rule my head
I can't stop the motion
Whisper something so sweet
This could be the night
This could be the night
Breaking my heart to see you lover
Things you say are things you've said before
Sometimes when I'm lonely I close my eyes
Some nights when I can't sleep I fantasize
Hard to believe that you're right here tonight
I'm going out of my mind
I think this could be the one night
I give in to this fight
Cause you rule my head
I can't stop the motion
Whisper something so sweet
This could be the night
Tell me what was I supposed to do
With that type of attention
I gave all that I had to you
You forgot to mention
When you say that your heart is true
It's just an invention
Tell me what was I supposed to do
With that type of attention
I gave all that I had to you
You forgot to mention
When you say that your heart is true
It's just an invention
I think this could be the one night
I give in to this fight
Cause you rule on my head
I can't stop the motion
I can't stop the motion...
This could be the night
This could be the night
We were both headed different ways
Like a crash of thunder
Out in the rain waiting for the bus
There's an eight world wonder
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
Anything you want boy
We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie
I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
Anything you want boy
A dinner date and a glass of wine
We stayed up late and lost track of time
I feel a different hunger
You held my hand and you didn't let go
I'm gonna kiss you now
I thought you should know
There's an eighth world wonder
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
Anything you want boy
We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie
I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
Anything you want boy
We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie
Anything you want boy
Anything you want boy
Anything you want boy
We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie
I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
Anything you want boy
We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie
I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
And give you satisfaction
I'm never gonna get it
You're gonna be the one I never got that got away
Just a moment in time
But I can't forget it
But I'm going downtown like I still care
Like I'm still trying
I said I was over you but I'm lying
Every time you look at me
I know you're not evil
So why do you tease me
You don't make it easy
And it's like every time you look at me
You say that you're still not free
That still means someday you might be
Depending on where I am with you
I either love it or I hate it
We were just this close but we couldn't say it
I could take a picture
Of you and me together
No one would believe me
No one would believe me
That baby it don't get much better
And I will pick the city
If you're asking if I'd really like to see you again
Tell me that you feel it
This you and me together
No one would believe me
Even I cannot believe it
You kiss me like you mean it
Darling just say when
And I will pick the city
If you're asking if I'd really like to see you again
I say oh... just say when
I thought they'd keep us apart
And I will pick the city
I could take a picture
Of you and me together
No one would believe me
In the space between the words
In the silence of your eyes
In the hands that know the touch
It's the way I feel inside
Dancing cross this floor together
With every step I take I seem to want you more than ever
I'll never let you down
And I'll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
I'll never let you down
And I'll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
It's the beating of your heart
It's the tear I have to hide
It's the sound of your guitar
It's the way I feel inside
Dancing cross this floor together
With every step I take I seem to want you more than ever
I'll never let you down
And I'll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
I'll never let you down
And I'll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
If you need a shoulder
Or someone to hold you
I'll keep my arms open wide
I'll be the one who loves you
I'll be right there by your side
Dancing cross this floor together
With every step I take I seem to want you more than ever
I'll never let you down
And I'll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
I'll never let you down
And I'll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
In the space between the words
In the silence of your eyes
In the hands that know the touch
Baby I don't need to look far
Somebody should sound the alarm
You talk to me in riddles
You treat me like a crime
I know you have a girlfriend
So don't kiss me on the lips
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh don't you tell me what I did
I know you have a girlfriend
And every time you speak
I know you have a girlfriend
And I hear she's kinda nice
I know you have a girlfriend
So don't give me those eyes
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh won't you let me be
Tease me till I laugh and I relax
I know there's a reason for that
And talk to me in riddles
You cover me in rhymes
I know you have a girlfriend
So don't kiss me on the lips
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh don't you tell me what I did
I know you have a girlfriend
And every time you speak
I know you have a girlfriend
And I hear she's kinda nice
I know you have a girlfriend
So don't give me those eyes
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh won't you let me be
You're sick with dreams about it
I want it way too much
I know you have a girlfriend
And it cuts me like a knife
I know you have a girlfriend
And she's gonna be your wife
I know you have a girlfriend
I know you have a girlfriend
Tell me where is she tonight
I know you have a girlfriend
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh won't you let me be
And find our way back to good
Best turn the clocks to somewhere
And find our way back to good
We have all kinds of choices
And find our way back to good
And find our way back to good
If we could come true
If we could come true
I'd run away with you
I'll run away with you
I could be driving you all night
And I found your lips in the street lights
I wanna be there with you
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
I wanna stay here with you
I could be driving you all night
And I found your lips in the street lights
I wanna be there with you
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
I'll never want to let you go
Over the weekend we can turn the world to gold
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
Be tormented by me babe
Drink tequila for me babe
Let it hit you cool and hot
Let your feelings be revealing
That you can't forget me not
Not a flower on the wall
In your head and I won't stop
And all that we could do with this emotion
And all that we could do with this emotion
All that we could do with this emotion
Where the sky's forever blue
Tell me there is nothing
I can't have and nothing you won't do
Let it hit you cold and hot
And you can forget me not
Not a flower on the wall
In your head and I won't stop
And all that we could do with this emotion
And all that we could do with this emotion
All that we could do with this emotion
You and me in the dark right now
And all that we could do with this emotion
And all that we could do with this emotion
I feel like I could fly with the ball on the moon
Late night watching television
But I need to tell you something
I really really really really really really like you
I really really really really really really like you
When we're out of touch
I really really really really really really like you
It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Late night watching television
But I need to tell you something
I really really really really really really like you
I really really really really really really like you
When we're out of touch
I really really really really really really like you
Said you could keep them
I don't know how to act
The way I should be leaving
I'm running out of time
I need to tell you something
I really really really really really really like you
I really really really really really really like you
When we're out of touch
I really really really really really really like you
I really really really really really really like you
I really really really really really really like you
Drove by your place and stopped again tonight
I know I said that I'm too scared to try
I share my secrets and I will not hide
You got a hold of me the whole damn night
I toss and turn but still I can't sleep right
Why when I get right next to you
I feel the earthquake in the room and so I pray
It's the way we are together
Wanna feel like this forever
It's the way we are together
And I never thought I'd ever
I wanna play this for you all the time
I wanna play this for you when you're feeling used and tired
I wanna make the best of you and more
Just let me in your arms
Just let me in your arms
I'll be the magic you ever see
You can always rely on me
To help you do what you want to do
I wanna be the best you've ever known
Just let me in your arms
Just let me in your arms
Show me if you want me
I will be your friend
Show me if you want me
I will be your friend
I'll be your lighthouse when you're lost to see
I wanna be the place you call your home
Just let me in your arms
Just let me in your arms
Show me if you want me
I will be your friend
Show me if you want me
I will be your friend
I will never let you come apart
I will be your candle in the dark
When you need someone
Show me if you want me
I will be your friend
Show me if you want me
I will be your friend
Show me if you want me
I will be your friend
Show me if you want me
I will be your friend
Show me if you want me
I will be your friend
Show me if you want me
I will be your friend
I will be your friend
I will be your friend
If you're gonna go then go
She said to me on the phone
If you're gonna stay then stay
He's not gonna change anyway
And I know that she's right
And I should not be offended
That I know what it looks like
And I know that she's right
And I should not be offended
That I know what it looks like
Don't know what to do
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today
And I don't really care
I've got worse problems
I broke up with my boyfriend
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today
And I don't really care
I've got worse problems
I broke up with my boyfriend
Finally gotta let it go
She said to me on the phone
It could be the perfect day
You'll just make it rain anyway
And I know that she's right
And I should not be offended
That I know what it looks like
And I know that she's right
And I should not be offended
That I know what it looks like
Don't know what to do
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today
And I don't really care
I've got worse problems
I broke up with my boyfriend
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today
And I don't really care
I've got worse problems
I broke up with my boyfriend
What's worse is when you discover
You're not good for each other
Don't know what to do
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today
And I don't really care
I've got worse problems
I broke up with my boyfriend
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today
And I don't really care
I've got worse problems
I broke up with my boyfriend
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Baby I'm speeding and red lights are run
I know you've had a rough time
I'm making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
I'm making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
I'm making the most of the night
Baby I'm speeding and red lights are run
I know you've had a rough time
I'm making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
I'm making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
I'm making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
I'm making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
I'm making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
I used to be in love with you
You use to be the first thing on my mind
I know I'm just a friend to you
That I will never get to call you mine
I didn't mean to say what I said
But I can't get you out of my head
And I want you to miss me
When I'm not around you
I know that you're in town
Why won't you come around
To the spot that we met
I'm not the type of girl for you
And I'm not going to pretend
That I'm the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I'm not the type of girl you call more than a friend
I bet she acts so perfectly
You probably eat up every word she says
And if you ever think of me
I bet I'm just a flicker in your head
I didn't mean to say what I said
But I can't get you out of my head
And I want you to miss me
When I'm not around you
I know that you're in town
Why won't you come around
To the spot that we met
I'm not the type of girl for you
And I'm not going to pretend
That I'm the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I'm not the type of girl you call more than a friend
I didn't mean to say what I said
But I can't get you out of my head
I'm not the type of girl for you
And I'm not going to pretend
That I'm the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I'm not the type of girl you call more than a friend
I was never one to want to
Put my trust in someone else completely
And I was always one to want to
Up and run when someone said they needed me
Baby let's go get lost
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Baby let's take the long way home
I was always shy and careful
I was sure that you would never look at me
Never wanted to discourage
Everything your eyes encouraged silently
Baby let's go get lost
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Baby let's take the long way home
Baby let's go get lost
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
I remember being naked
Never cared about the fake kids
We would write and sing and wear whatever
But money makes your whole world spin
Till everything is dizzy and suddenly
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup so
You pour and I'll say stop
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup
So you pour and I'll say stop
Take me into your arms again
Haven't seen the boy in ages
Used to stay up all night he and I
Filling up each of these pages
But the teeth come out when the camera flashes
We said we'd always be the same
But we lost each other in the game cause suddenly
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup so
You pour and I'll say stop
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup
So you pour and I'll say stop
Take me into your arms again
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup so
You pour and I'll say stop
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup
So you pour and I'll say stop
Take me into your arms again
Take me into your arms again
Take me into your arms again
I've got a cavern of secrets
None of them are for you
Even if you wanted to keep them
Let down my guard tonight
I just don't care anymore
I've told a hundred lies
But I don't wanna tell you any at all
And I can not control it
The way you're making me feel
And you have got me going
Saw my reflection in the mirror
My hands and heart were tied
But I was scared of almost nothing at all
And I can not control it
The way you're making me feel
And you have got me going
Sweet one you should stop me there but I keep on talking
You catch me when I'm falling for you
You catch me when I'm falling
We could take the words back
You could take my love back
And brush my hair behind my ear
I don't know what you wanted
I tried to be so perfect
I thought that it was worth it
To let myself just disappear
You come to me in dreams at night
I wake up and I see the light
Sometimes I wish that I could change
Thought you were the hero
I waited for you all night
I closed my eyes and slept for years
You kissed me like a sunrise
I feel it through my forehead
I felt it like a goodbye
Sometimes I wish that I could change
You come to me in dreams at night
You come to me in dreams at night
I don't want to work it out
I don't want to work it out
No I'm not going to still
Sometimes I wish that I could change
I don't care about your good intentions
I care more about your bad dreams
I want a love on a new dimension
You know I'm gonna be
Under the blossom tree
Cutting through the cracks of the concrete
You think love is a destination
Like a show on your TV
You'll cry to your generation
But don't you cry to me
Under the blossom tree
Cutting through the cracks of the concrete
Cutting through the cracks of the concrete
Everything you ever wanted
Everything you ever wanted
Everything you ever wanted
Everything you ever wanted
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean
If you just give me a chance
Do you see what I see
Hey Joe's calling me over
I only came here for you
Something is taking me over
I only came here for you
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean
If you just give me a chance
Do you see what I see
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean
If you just give me a chance
Do you see what I see
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean
If you just give me a chance
Do you see what I see
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean
If you just give me a chance
When I'm close to you
When I'm close to you
Making love until the morning light
Making out like it's the end of the world
And I really wanna get it right
When I'm close to you
When I'm close to you
When I'm close to you
You know I didn't mean it darling
Sweet like the morning light
Gone late into the evening
All I want is to hold you
Make you rock away this feeling for me
You know I didn't mean it
Until I saw you in my thunderstorm
I wanna be the one that's in your arms
I never get to hold you
You're all that I need
You're all that I need
I never get to hold you
You're all that I need
You're all that I need
Oh sugar sugar spice and all things nice
I'll be there for you
Just say you'll stay the night
I need you till the morning light
My only heart is beating for you
You know I didn't mean it
Until I saw you in my thunderstorm
I wanna be the one that's in your arms
I never get to hold you
You're all that I need
You're all that I need
I never get to hold you
You're all that I need
You're all that I need
But I don't think anybody understands you
I know you'll let it go to head
I don't think anybody understands you
I know you'll let it go to head
I never get to hold you
You're all that I need
You're all that I need
I never get to hold you
You're all that I need
Open up your heart to the ceiling
Don't you know it hurts for a reason
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
Won't you dance with me
It's a lot to give and it's driving me crazy
I never meant to fight with you
I wanted us to stay together
And even now my love is true
I know that we can't be together
Open up your heart to the ceiling
Don't you know it hurts for a reason
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
Somewhere out there someone is breathing
Just for you their heart keeps on beating
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
The sky is turning black now
It's too late for us and there's no turning back now
I never meant to fight with you
I wanted us to stay together
And even now our love is true
I know that we can't be together
Open up your heart to the ceiling
Don't you know it hurts for a reason
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
Somewhere out there someone is breathing
Just for you their heart keeps on beating
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
Open up your heart to the ceiling
Don't you know it hurts for a reason
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
Somewhere out there someone is breathing
Just for you their heart keeps on beating
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
Keep them safe in case you should ever ask
I will wait right here by my windowsill
Everyone says I can never get my fill
Through all the heartbreak
Looking back I followed you everywhere
We were kids just playing with truth and dare
Through all the heartbreak
Make it up and start it over
Make it up and start it over
Feels like the first time
For someone who understands me for who I really am
Till you lift me up inside
Every one of my fears has vanished
I don't know how you managed
To wake me up and come alive
You take me higher than the rest
You pulled a gem out of the mess
You crept in and showed me how
Never let me hit the ground
All the love was hesitated
But ever since you came around
Every one of my fears has vanished
I don't know how you managed
To wake me up and come alive
You take me higher than the rest
You pulled a gem out of the mess
You take me higher than the rest
You pulled a gem out of the mess
He's just a friend of mine
But kiss me one more time
Tell me it's just for the fun of it
Tell me it's just for the fun of it
Don't tell me this is how it ends
I burn with fever that I caught from you
Well that could work but I'm still hot for you
But I'm so damn scared
I've still been sleeping at my friend's
Dropped off your helmet and lock for me
I wrote some things I didn't send
Three words to say that meant a lot to me
To your house last night
And I'm so damn scared
It's a different world when you're not here with me
Go on and break my heart tonight
Don't break my heart tonight
Don't break my heart tonight
Don't break my heart tonight
Don't break my heart tonight
It's a different world when you're not here with me
Go on and break my heart tonight
And if you love me baby
Body language will do the trick
That's the danger with missing it
And if you love me baby
Body language will do the trick
That's the danger with missing it
Body language will do the trick
That's the danger with missing it
You're king of the castle
I want you to stay tonight
He never wants to strip down to his feelings
He never wants to kiss and close his eyes
I never really know when he'll be leaving
And you got your reasons
You've got a way that makes it all right
I want you to stay tonight
He never wants to strip down to his feelings
He never wants to kiss and close his eyes
I never really know when he'll be leaving
You're king of the castle
He never wants to strip down to his feelings
He never wants to kiss and close his eyes
I never really know when he'll be leaving
Sunlight moves upon my skin
Wake up and I'm next to you
But I wish that I was next to him
Looks like this could be the end
Know that you'll be alright
Maybe one day we'll be friends
I'm not that good at goodbyes
Sometimes it's best to just fly
Wish it hadn't come to this
But you know there's some things you can't mend
I'm not that good at goodbyes
Sometimes it's best to just fly
I'm not that good at goodbyes
Sometimes it's best to just fly
Said it before and I'll say it again
That I'll always be here when you need a friend
I sat with you on my bedroom floor
I saw you like I never did before
And I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of seasons and you're back
A simple change of heart and you attack
I've said it before and I'll say it again
That I'll always be here if you need a friend
I sat with you on my bedroom floor
I saw you like I never did before
And I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of seasons and you're back
A simple change of heart and you attack
Love made in the park
Big black blossom tree
Please don't let me go...
Please don't let me go...
And I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of seasons and you're back
A simple change of heart and you attack
Love made in the park
Big black blossom tree
In my single childhood bed
Wish that you were here with me
Last year when my hands were cold
You were always there to hold
So give me your warmest pair
Your strongest pair of mittens
Something to get me through
The loneliness of Christmas eve
So give me your warmest pair
Your strongest pair of mittens
By my table I survive
Fix the makeup from my eyes
Fake a smile so they will see
Wish that you were here with me
Last year when my hands were cold
You were always there to hold
So give me your warmest pair
Your strongest pair of mittens
Something to get me through
The loneliness of Winter
So give me your warmest pair
Your strongest pair of mittens
You were wrong to make me
Walking through my old home town
No one else but me around
Make an angel in the snow
Pray that I can let you go
So give me your warmest pair
So give me your warmest pair
Your strongest pair of mittens
How to find the right way back to me
I'll take a friend or a stranger
Who'll say it's all alright
I may not be all I dreamed I'd be
I will find the life I find
If I only have my guide
And together we will ride
I'll take a friend or a stranger
All I need is an angel here today
Who will help me find my way
One angel who will guide me through
All I need is an angel
I'll take a friend or a stranger
All I need is an angel here with me
To help me through all the changes
All I need is an angel
I'll be fine with an angel who's all mine
Won't you send me down a sign
We crossed the line and it was on
And take me all the way
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna play where you play with the angels
Show me devotion and take me all the way
Show me devotion and take me all the way
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna cut to the feeling
Maybe there is something the matter with me
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
I wanna be where the people are
Up where they stay all day in the sun
That they don't reprimand their daughters
I'm ready to know what the people know
Ask them my questions
What's a fire and why does it
Pucker up in sunglasses
Making love to the flashes
Posing the way that we do
Pull over through your lashes
Only thing that will last is
I take a picture of you
Taking a picture of me
I take a picture of you
Taking a picture of me
I take a picture of you
Taking a picture of me
Tomorrow always happens too soon
I wish I had an electric moon
With the day dreamers
Pucker up in sunglasses
Making love to the flashes
Posing the way that we do
Pull over through your lashes
Only thing that will last is
I take a picture of you
Taking a picture of me
I take a picture of you
Taking a picture of me
I take a picture of you
Taking a picture of me
Tomorrow always happens too soon
I wish I had an electric moon
And it goes on and on and on
And we go on and on and on
I wanna live live live
We wanna live live live
And it goes on and on and on
And we go on and on and on
I wanna live live live
We wanna live live live
I take a picture of you taking a picture of me
I take a picture of you taking a picture of me
Tomorrow always happens too soon
I wish I had an electric moon
I wanna smash your fears
And get drunken off your tears
Don't you share your smile with anyone else but me
I wanna touch your heart
I wanna crush it in my hands
Make you plead and cry as you give up all the lies
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
I'll keep dancing till the morning with somebody new
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Stuck in a real bad dream
And man it feels so new to me
Should be in your arms but I'm begging at your feet
It's been a real hard night
And I just hold my pillow tight
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
I'll keep dancing till the morning with somebody new
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over.
And runner up is what they called ya
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
I'll keep dancing till the morning with somebody new
Tonight I'm getting over you
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
Clouds as mean as you've ever seen
Ain't a bird that knows your tune
Then a little voice inside of you whispers
Says that they're as lost as you
So everybody shout it together
When you're lost out there and you're all alone
A light is waiting to carry you home
When you're lost out there and you're all alone
A light is waiting to carry you home
My father sits at night with no lights on
His cigarette glows in the dark
The living room is still
I tiptoe past the master bedroom where
My mother reads her magazines
But I forget how to dream
But you say it's time we moved in together
They have their houses and their lawns
They have their silent noons
Their children hate them for the things they're not
They hate themselves for what they are
But you say it's time we moved in together
You say that we can keep our love alive
The couples cling and claw
And drown in love's debris
You say we'll soar like two birds through the clouds
But soon you'll cage me on your shelf
I'll never learn to be just me first
I'm planning a trip all alone
And all I want is a room with a view
Where the sight of the sunset full blown
Makes me ache with feeling alone.
And I'll think about you there
And I'll care about you there
As it's love I've know
It seems that I'm hearing those noises again
Flashbacks keep sending me way back to when
The sounds of the waves on the stones
Play it again before you put your guitar down
About the good times.
Follow me wherever I will go
And drank the cheapest wine.
And he believed in me
Down by the serpentine.
It was the best thing
To come along for a long time.
And saw three children with smiles.
What I could make of the youngest child.
And as she blew the candles out
It was the best thing
To come along for a long time.
What do the people at the end of the world do
Go on ahead and make a stand.
You are just a sinner.
You were my one and only man.
Because you are just a sinner.
Reach up for that light and let it shine.
Today I have no light to guide me
You are just a sinner.
Because you are just a sinner.
Go on ahead and make a stand.
I said that I felt jailed up
As if our doors were nailed up
I said I needed my fling
Had to get out and do some other thing.
It took me months to calculate
Now I've got to fall back on dreams
I thought I'd try and write you
I thought I'd try and phone you
I thought I'd try to tell you
That I smell your hair still on my pillow
But you'd just mile to please me
Remind me it was I who first claimed
That we both required freedom
I'd ask you up for coffee
Anytime you had an hour open.
You'll camp out by the lakes and forests.
A footstep in the sand
A truth to understand.
To still some other plan.
Hidden meanings and love's strange ways
But all I find is that behind
Each new door is another door.
You'll be an angel yet.
I think I'll win the bet.
First one in the city
Someone got his hair cut
The girls have lots to say
His friends had felt more comfortable
With it worn the other way
And I don't know if I'll see you again.
Next one at the old house
Snow is on the ground
Photographs and wine are passed around
Someone toasts an absent friend
Another takes his seat
They gather round the dying fire
But the circle's not complete
And I don't know if I'll see you again
Last one by the highway
Wind blows through thin smiles
Someone made a wrong turn
Missed a joke by miles
Someone got their hair cut
People who have bad times
Write hard luck songs
But when their days are green
They think about love
People who have short hair
Write short hair songs
But when their hair gets long
They think about winding it around in daisy chains
Just to wash it in the rain
People who have no hills
Write songs about plains
But if that's not what you want to do
Well you can jump aboard a bus
Or boat or wooden canoe
I know just the mountain
Too write songs about the peaks
Because the love's still growing
And the love's still growing
That all hope is gone
Because the love's still growing
And the love's still growing
We can never know about the days to come
But we think about them anyway.
And I wonder if I'm really with you now
Or just chasing after some finer day
Is keeping me waiting
And I tell you how easy it feels to be with you
And how right your arms feel around me.
But I rehearsed those words just late last night
When I was thinking about how right tonight might be.
Is keeping me waiting
And tomorrow we might not be together
So I'll try and see into your eyes right now
Well I have known you
Since you were a small boy
And your mama used to say
Then you'd turn on the radio
And sing with the singer in the band
Your mama would say to you
But you're a legend in your own time
A hero in the footlights
But a legend's only a lonely boy
When he goes home alone.
And though I know you
Still have the heart of that small boy
Can ever feel that she's been really touched
Then you turn on the radio
And sing with the singer in the band
Think kind of sadly to yourself
This isn't exactly what you had planned
But you're a legend in your own time
A hero in the footlights
But a legend's only a lonely boy
When he goes home alone
Well a legend's only a lonely boy
Our first day together
Was after we'd been close in dreams
Was after we'd shared hell and heaven
After we'd spent nights together
And breathed secrets without words
After we'd made promises
That could but might not have been heard
Might not have been heard
Knowing me the way you do
Then why did you just say
That our first day together
Tell me who you long for
In your secret dreams
Go on and tell me who you wish I was
The girl you think you see
Whoever you want is exactly who
I'm more than willing to be
A Peace Corps trainee
Who cares what I might be for real
I'll let you chose from a thousand faces
The girl you think you see
Whoever you want is exactly who
I'm more than willing to be
The girl you think you see
Whoever you want is exactly who
I'm more than willing to be
Here now summer's coming around again
Every year it seems to come in this way
Before you know it you've fallen in love
But be sure it's love before you sail away
You see someone wearing a sunny face
You want to know him anyway that you can
Tell him you're just in from Shanghai
And his smile you just can't pass by
Sad to say he hasn't seen you come by this way
His sunny smile just reflects sunny days
Haven't you seen his face before
Every year it seems to come this way
To watch the world go up in flames
Just bring on the acrobats and clowns
Please ignore the baying of the hounds
To watch the world go up in flames
Give us some time to work things out...
Give us some time to work things out...
They'll set your mind at ease.
We'll lay our fears aside
To smell and taste and touch and see.
If I have known you only three days
But I could swear I'll love you always
And if the gods will please be kind
And on the road you have some good times
But when the show is over you go home
Lonesome for the you I might have known.
And I'll be in London by sundown
And the memory of your last look
The way you took me by surprise
And the way you turned my head around
Julie through the glass
You've just got to be
The sweetest thing I've ever seen.
Julie through the glass
And who knows where you've been
And where you're gonna go.
We want you to love the world
To know it well and play a part
And we'll help you to learn to love yourself
Julie through the glass
I'm looking forward to
Doing things with you
Easy as a dream up into my room.
And before I realized the danger
I found myself looking into your eyes.
Of things I'd never seen before
It's all over... I've got to have you.
Knowing in a moment I could lose you.
Then without a warning I remembered that
You trembled at the touch of my hand.
Knowing when you came to me that no one else
Would ever feel the same in my arms
It's all over... I've got to have you.
Of holding you asleep in my arms.
Dreaming while my hair was blowing
Softer than a whisper on my cheek.
I don't know the feeling so I don't know if it's love
But it's enough... It's enough
I can't help it... I've got to have you.
You're with me now and as long as you stay
I know you've had some bad luck with ladies before
They drove you or you drove them crazy
But more important is I know you're the one and I'm sure
And it used to be for a while
That the river flowed right to my door
Making me just a little too free
But now the river doesn't seem to stop here anymore
Hold me in your hands like a bunch of flowers
And I know what I think I've known all along
Nothing you could ever do would turn me away from you
I love you now and I love you now
Even though you're ten thousand miles away
I'll love you tomorrow as I love you today
The Carter family lived next door for almost 14 years
Then Gwen began to bore me with her giggles and her fears
I told new friends Gwen Carter had become a silly pest
And then I found I missed her more than I'd ever have guessed
Grandma used to nag at me to straighten up my spine
To act respectful and read good books
To take care of what was mine
I hated being criticized and asking her permission
And then I found I missed her more than I'd ever have guessed
Your manners were too rough
And now at night I think of how you grinned when you undressed
You walked into the party
Like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror as
You watched yourself gavotte
And all the boys dreamed that they'd be your partner
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
When I was still quite naive
When you said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
And your horse naturally won
To see the total eclipse of the sun
And when you're not you're with
Some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
You probably think this song is about you
You probably think this song is about you
His friends are more than fond of Robin
He doesn't need to compliment them
And always as he leaves he leaves them
Feeling proud just to know him
When Robin goes on holiday
But they're not like Robin
But I'll be yours until we're old
Please learn to call me in your dreams
He's talked about before he gets there
Though he can never understand it
And I would like to be his alone
But I'm shy and can't demand it
But when Robin gives his love to others
We tell each other everything
About the lovers in the past
And why they didn't last
We share a cast of characters from A to Z
We know each other's fantasies
And though we know each other better when we explore
That I never knew some of those secrets of yours
The beach was empty but for one
Now you were lying in the sun
She drank a pint of your rum
And later when you told me
You said she was a bore
That I never knew some of those secrets of yours
You always answer my questions
But they don't always answer my prayers
And though I know you say that it's me that you adore
Some of those secrets of yours
Some of those secrets of yours
Some of those secrets of yours
While Daddy next door whistled whiskey tunes
There was nothing those two couldn't do
And I'm leaving everything I am to you
Go chase the wild and night time streets sang Daddy
I thought together they must sing the moon away
I thought that they must know each other well
Wasn't lost between their Heaven and their Hell
Then one night Daddy died and went to Heaven
And God came down to earth and slipped away
And later night time songs came back again
But the singers don't compare with those I knew
And I never figured out where God and Daddy went
Please tell my sweet mother
Go on now tell uncle Paul
Tell all my girlfriends
And I've already waited too long
Raise up your eyebrows
But don't expect me to be home tonight
But I've already waited too long
I met a boy with eyes of green
The warmest eyes I'd ever seen
The way I've always heard it would be
And I've already waited so long
Make my bed wide and long
Tell all my girlfriends
I said I've already waited too long
Sun against our skin instead of clothes
And whenever we felt drowsy we would doze
I remember a time when our fears could be named
And courage meant not refusing dares
No only on the squares
Or else we'd be abducted by the bears
And broken hearts and sentimental schemes
Now every tender failure seems to overthrow old dreams
Love can lead a normal woman to extremes
Now a fish kinda likes the water
And that's just where he wants to be
And a monkey kinda digs bananas
So he lives in the top of a tree
But my eyes are made for darkness
So the nighttime is right for me
Most folks they like the daytime
But when the sun goes down
And the bright lights shine
My daytime has just begun
Won't you turn out them bright lights baby
They're just about to drive me blind
Oh won't you draw then curtains for me papa
Watch and you'll see my love light shine
Now there are two sides to this great big world
And one of them is always night
If you can take care of business in the sunshine baby
I guess you're gonna be all right
But don't come looking for me to lend you a hand
My eyes just can't stand the light
When you close your eyes do you see
She's not half as magic as she seems
But she's so much fun to be with
When you close your eyes do you see
Places that you've never seen
Yet you've been there
You've been walking on the edges of a dream
And you're so much fun to be with
Hard as you try you were never really meant to weep
When you close your door with a sign
That it's just as magic as it feels
Lobsters dancing on the dock
Switzerland's been weird since they unplugged the clocks
Man and a woman living in Brooklyn Heights
Each convinced that the other is in the wrong
If through all the madness
We can stick together
Flash from Mexico... the TOREADORS have all turned gay
Roman whores have quit to seek a better way
Dope has undermined the morale of the Buckingham Palace guards
Motorcycle gangs ride naked down Hollywood Boulevard
If through all the madness
We can stick together
New York women want me sounding off like a Suffragette
I know that each of us is alone in the end
But the trip still feels less dangerous when you've got a friend
The world's just turned inside out and upside down
I've got my man on my mind.
Notice he won't always let me in.
Got my man on my mind.
He's a northern baby and a southern child.
He's a gentleman lost at the fair.
Platform shoes on table tops
I think I'm gonna be a lady
I think I'm gonna tell him maybe
I wouldn't be naughty for the sake of naught
Or be different just to differ
I wouldn't sell myself just to get bought
Or give to just deliver
When I am a river then I'll want to listen to me
And you wind me up and play me
And the way to treat a lady
She rides in the front seat...
She's my older sister.
She knows her power over me.
She goes to bed an hour later than I do
When she turns the lights out
She flies through the back door.
She's my older sister.
She has ice skates and legs that fit right in.
She's wicked to all the beaming dreamers who later
Boast of an evening by her fiery side.
And in her black gymnastic tights
She runs into some elastic nights
Sophisticated sister sings for the soldiers of the soccer team.
Their silver ideas and sororities
They tinker with love and their Model T's
She turns everybody's heads
While I wear her last year's threads
With patches and stitches and a turned up hem.
You stick to me when I wish you gone
You hammer on my thoughts through dreams
Your plot is thick with saucy schemes
And ways to reach my balconies
But I say I'm not turned on by the way you look
I say I'm not turned on by the way you act
I'm not turned on when you tell me that you need me
You can see the softness in my eyes
The thoughts I swallow leave me thirsty
You do a very fine imitation of me
And I say I'm not turned on by the way you laugh
I'm not turned on by the way you smile
I'm not turned on when you tell me that you love me
You can see the softness in my eyes
And I say I'm not turned on by the way you dance
I'm not turned on my the way you laugh
I'm not turned on when you need me
You can see the softness in my eyes
Says spittle on the griddle
As you drop that batter into that hot butter
What we got is hotcakes
Puffing up fluffy and sweet
There are plenty of late nights
If you want to stay up for them
You'll just want to find yourself a friend
And tie a couple on in a night spot
For tears in your beer
It's hip to be miserable when you're young and intellectual
In a bit you'll admit you're a misfit
About 10 o'clock we'll turn off the light
Not every man was born to stay up late at night
If you notice all the sails in the wind
But you better look hard my friend
In case you catch a ride on the wrong one
In the distance is the one you belong on
In a bit you'll admit you're a misfit
We'll sit under a tree
And if you get the itch
I'll supply the scratch
Not every man was born with a boat to catch
It's hip to be miserable when you are young and intellectual
In a bit you'll admit you're a misfit
To let you know the way I feel
Time alone will tell us
May grow bitter and jealous
It's not another lovers game
It doesn't seem to have a name
It changes and remains the same
Yesterday's projection will never really know
But tomorrow's recollection will surely show
That isn't in the way I act
That'll carry through the years intact
From further on down the track
I stood in the doorway in my white nightgown
The grownups inside used words I didn't know
But still I enjoyed the show
And I just like them would know it all when I matured
And I wouldn't be afraid of the darkness or the bears
Or the cracks in the ceiling upstairs
Lat night at a friend's house a little girl was there
She stood in the doorway playing with her hair
She looked up to me as if I could do no wrong
As I got up to sing my song
I sang it with a shiver in my throat and in my knees
Feeling just as small as a thistle in a breeze
But the child's imagination carried me along
And saw me through my song
All those crazy nights when I cried myself to sleep
Now melodrama never makes me weep anymore
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you
How to turn down the noise in my mind
Now I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you
Suffering was the only thing that made me feel I was alive
Though that's just how much it cost to survive in this world
How to open up and drink in all that white love
Pouring down from the heaven
I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Clothes strewn around the room
Looks like a wind swept through
Made a wild man out of you
And doesn't anger turn you on
An expectation of a calm
And your body feels so warm
The wind's blowing the moon down
Underneath the eiderdown
You're taking me to town
And you're tossing me around
And you come on like a hurricane
And your body feels so warm
And you come on like a hurricane
And your body feels so warm
I've seen the sidewalks
Of the lamps and tables and the paperback books
That you throw out there
Make up a pile so high
Could tie up the traffic in the thoroughfare
Put your love out on the street
Put your love out on the street
Put your love out on the street
Put your love out on the street tonight
I don't mind your sinning
I've come to know you so well
So let flow the hydrants
And we'll dance in the spray
And we'll wash out our dirty laundry
Won't you give me all your limes
And I will give you a reason
I'll rub them on my body
And smell like the West Indies
And I'm giving you all my sighs
It's your heat that makes me warm
Makes me climb on you like a tree
And I don't need no fancy dancing
When you bend over me
We'll be like two lazy sunbathers
Swaying palm trees against the sky
I want to give you more
More than just a melody
To let you know that I love you
I want to give you more
More than just a song to sing
To let you know that it's the real thing
Serenades and symphonies
We'll make romantic rhapsodies
I want to give you more
More than just a love affair
Lay your head upon my breast
Fondle me with your tenderness
We've got the key to happiness
Close your eyes and I'll do the rest
I want to give you more
More than even life itself
Listening for your footsteps
Just waiting like a fool
Burning with a fever only you can cool
The clock beside my pillow
Has ticked away the night
Like a heartbeat mocking me
Gotta stop these thoughts about you
Gotta learn to live without you
Gotta find some freedom for this weary slave
And I'm longing for you
And I'm burning for you
I worship your opinions
And I imitate your ways
I try to make you grace me
With a word of praise
However much I tell myself
That I'm strong and free and brave
I'm just another woman
I find I gave away the soul
That I wanted you to save
I'm just another woman
And I'm longing for you
And I'm longing for you
There's a new kind of dancing
That's gonna be the rage
You just leave yourself behind
Like an actor on a stage
Shine a different attitude
Strut around the floor in a different attitude
Any attitude is the proper attitude
Don't be afraid to change your attitude
Free up your spirit with a new attitude
If you stretch or shake
And it don't really matter
What moves your body makes
And it don't really matter
What steps you choose to do
Strut around the floor in a different attitude
Learn to move in another attitude
Find the groove in a new attitude
Don't be afraid of a new attitude
It don't really matter
What steps you choose to do
Strut around the floor in a new attitude
Do the locomotion in a new attitude
Do the mashed potato in a new attitude
Capture it and freeze
A hundred and eighty degrees
Or if you're at a loss
Observe some natural dude
And turn into a mirror of his attitude
To think of what we dreamed of
Where are those sons of summer now
Who could laugh the lights away
Nights on the beach and bay
And the course in the bar
Always the first time shines to last like a morning star
It's been a while since the last time we were dancing
Where are those sons of summer now
To chase the blues away
I've got the blues today
Your ivy days and your clubhouse ways
Wine mug nights when the music played
Love that is real will not fade away like a morning star
Where are those sons of summer now
And you don't know how to turn your
Your books won't hold you
I begin to question your schoolboy soul
Clever remarks that once won my heart
When the fire won't light they lose their spark
And I can't help but get a little bit blue
Thinking about the precious nothing we
Some strong feeling's some old love
I saw you and it made no sense at all
Now I feel like there's too much caffeine in my blood
Like a waterfall washing me down
Like a waterfall going down
Just like a waterfall washing me down
Like a waterfall going down and down and down
You're an old lover making new contact
Making those cold defenses melt
And though lying in your arms is after the fact
Once again I'm feeling like I've never felt
It's like a waterfall going down
Like a waterfall washing me down
Like a waterfall going down
Just like a waterfall washing me down
Or did I just hit a funny bone
Or am I just hoping for too much
I hear there's another side to you
Well there's another side to me too
Let's get over to the other side
I hear there's an underneath to you
Well there's an underneath to me too
Let's get down underneath
Well everybody's lonesome
So it's safe to assume you're lonesome
We lived up here in Cambridge
And browsed in the hippest newsstands
The we started our own newspaper
Gave the truth about Uncle Sam
We loved to be so radical
But like a ragged love affair
Some became disenchanted
And some of us just got scared
Now are you playing possum
Keeping a low profile
Are you playing possum for a while
Then you moved to the country
Bought a farm and tilled the land
Then you took your books to India
And got hooked on a holy man
But the wells they do run dry
And the speeches turn to words
And the woods are full of tigers
And freedom's for the birds
Now you run a bookstore
And you've taken on a wife
You wear patches on your elbows
And you live an easy life
But are you finally satisfied
Or does it sneak up on you
You said we'd light the firmament
You said our love was permanent
You said we'd stick through thick and thin
But comes the first sign of stormy weather
You can't pretend it's Camelot
Then start to run when things get hot
When love explodes there's always heat
There's always bitter with the sweet
There's always times when your legs feel broken
But you still don't drop out of the dance
Say where you gonna hide
You go on leaving out your heart
And all it's saying deep inside
You don't have to worry
You just been lonely too long
I know what it means to hide your heart
But what you've been keeping to yourself
Well you know it just ain't fair
For the rest of your life
Why are you in such a hurry
To be lonely one more night
I know what it means to hide your heart
Doesn't like to hear the baby cry
Doesn't like to about the aches and pains
But the mother advertised as a bargain wife
She'd make things easy for the rest of his life
And to make herself more appealing
She'd think only of him and forget her own feelings
Wants his wife to be the gardener
And still look like a Hollywood Starlet
And still look like a Hollywood Starlet
So the mother gets mad and she leaves town
That brings the father and the baby down
She wants the father to find her
Gets her back and gets up in the night
Loves her so much and holds the baby tight
Ain't that enough to make you cry
Ain't that enough to make you cry
Doesn't like to hear the baby cry
Doesn't like to know about the aches and pains
But he still worked hard and believed in God
He was a man of integrity
He went to France on business
Met a woman there named Simone
She saw love in the eyes of the American guy
And she didn't like to be alone
Living on the Buffalo Bayou
She packed up all her perfume
For the gusty pioneer
So they flew hand in hand to Houston
He said we have an income bigger than France
We all think that's swell
He loved her French accent
And her knowledge of the arts
Having a millionaire sweetheart
So they got married up in Dripping Springs
Flew her Mama in from Cannes
Now she thinks about France and the nightlife there
Likes to see the livestock shows
And when he's not off on business
And she gets weary on a twelve mile prairie
Why do I try to win the love
That I've already wooed and won
He likes to roll he likes to roll
He takes the flower from his button hole
I tend to lose my self control
Here in this little sunny bay
Once a day he comes and goes
The moon is down but the odds are high
Was together about you
I was an expert a silence
I enjoyed the blonds in their red jeeps
Stopping you on the street
Knowing none could compare with me
In my airy skirts and cool retreats
In times when my head was together about you
I was an expert at silence
You could have told the truth all the time
I was that at ease inside
You never made me cry
And then one night I lied
I got down with a boy in the backwoods
I didn't tell you and you didn't see
And that's when jealousy got the dog up in me
Now every look you get
Seems like another threat
I pick your pockets almost hoping to find
Though now I just can't sit still
And though that boy meant nothing to me
On a two way street for love
I see no end to the dead end
Till you come back home again
I've tried everything to keep remembering
It takes one good woman and one good man
To make one love stand
The only thing that hurts is the memory
Of having once lived by myself
I put my love out on the shelf
He took everything and left my ears ringing
I feel at home in a foreign land
You know what's next when there's nothing planned
You know it takes two
Drinking alone on the prow
Chasing your Bourbon with Tennessee gin
The big game's about to begin
Hiding that Ave up your sleeve
The irony bending your smile
And I won't tip your hand
I want to stay near you
You can defy all the odds
You can draw diamonds to fill out your flush
You can find someone to trust
And I won't steal your chips
I won't steal your pride
Won't you take me on faith
Won't you let me inside
Under our velvet and lace
Let's make a place that's safe
Chain smoking cigarettes
Enemies across the table
We argue through the night
You catch your flight
I hail a cab with no idea where home might be
We both believed my chance was gone
But ain't it strange how life goes on
A storm can never rage forever
Hotel blinds stay drawn
Nothing seems to make me care
I can't find a reason to comb my hair
Everyone has something to do
We both believed my chance was gone
But ain't it strange how life goes on
A storm can never rage forever
And your voice sounds strange on the telephone
Strange how smooth and casual my own voice sounds
I find that I'm listening to
A tune coming over my radio
It makes me think of a guy I knew a while ago
You come on strong telling everyone
About your latest role
And if you have no time for all your offers
You'll see that I get called
And if you have no time for all your men
You'll see that I get balled
Well I don't expect humility
But what about some good old fashioned dishonest modesty
You say that you can understudy
You can write a song that will make us cry
That touches all our hearts
And you can House and Garden
But I know you can Bitch and Screw
And Penthouse just as well
I don't expect humility
But what about some good old dishonest modesty
Though you call yourself petite
And you hang around with all the clowns
You think they're so elite
Well I don't expect humility
If all our flights are grounded
Dance along the boulevards
And have no one to embarrass
With an Arab and an Heiress
And leave behind our blues
We'll trade them all in
See how dark the circles grow
In a town that has no light
So many eyes just staring out
Into the bloodshot night
And I want to share it all with you
And if it brings us to our knees
We'll trade it all in for a Paris breeze
They say it don't come easy
And they say that love is blind
If you're afraid to be close
Then love is hard to find
And if you spend too much time winning love
There's no time to be kind
And Libby I'm guilty of your crimes
I'm just another passenger
Traveling on these crazy high seas
Very likely be the same
If all our flights are grounded
Libby we'll go to Paris
And wish we were back home again
Or sailing on the ocean
Just a window and a drink
To set our dreams in motion
Trade them in for a Paris breeze
River runs to the sea
Salmon runs to the sea
Flowers grow to the sun
If you've lost the warmth
Lay back on the starry night
Feel as big and as small as you are
Well I see who you are
And I like what I see
Were you looking for my reaction
What do you need to know
Don't you know I'll always be your girl
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
Thought we'd closed the book
You don't have to prove to me that you're beautiful to strangers
I'm home again in my old narrow bed
Where I grew tall and my feet hung over the end
The low beam room with the window looking out
On the soft summer garden
Where the boys grew in the trees
And no one was at fault
Frightened by the power in every innocent thought
And the silent understanding passing down
Let the boys grow in the trees
Do you go to them or do you let them come to you
Do you stand in back afraid that you'll intrude
Deny yourself and hope someone will see
And live like a flower
While the boys grew in the trees
Tonight I lie alone again and curse my own desires
Sentenced first to burn and then to freeze
And watch by the window
We jumped into a river on the moon
But the water was too cold
We tried to buy the morning star
But it was already sold
I wanted to make it big with you
But my plans must have been to bold TOO
And it's back down to earth again
Back in my car and gone
Back on the road alone
You were my summer angel
You're eyes how they shone
Just last night we were talking about
How much our love had grown
I wanted to prove how good it could be
But my plans will have to be postponed
Back in my car and gone
Till the sun dries up the sea
Until then I'll always be
I'll be yours till endless time
I'll adore your charms sublime
Guess by now you know that I'm
I'll never give you reason to cry
I'd be unhappy if you were blue
Through the years our love will grow
Like a river it will flow
It can't die because I'm so
I'll never give you reason to cry
I'd be unhappy if you were blue
Like a river it will flow
It can't die because I'm so
Well I come home from a party
And I walk on in the kitchen and
You see he wait in the fireplace
When he hear that I'm getting a little snack
De bat fly in me face
And fly in me face tonight
De bat he rat got wings
All the children know that
What I need to know from the lord
They say a bat's got radar
And he can fly through fan
But what I am afraid of is
That he got another plan
And fly in me face tonight
One thing I forgot to tell you about the human race
Everybody get a little upset when a bat fly in they face
Waiting to be picked up and bounced down again on
And you know who I am
Though I never leave my name or number
I'm locked inside of you so it doesn't matter
And you know who I am
Though I never leave my name or number
I'm locked inside of you so it doesn't matter
And I can't sleep easy
And then the memory of the dream
There's always someone haunting someone
Just a little boy in the body of a dream
Can't stay up and won't go to sleep
Well I spent all night alone with you
And you weren't even there
Your eyes burned on me like the midnight sun
And somewhere in the night I knew
How much I really cared
For me you are the one
I tried to keep my distance afraid of striking out
But protect myself from life is all I've done
So I got to tell you now
Before another night goes by
For me you are the one
And sometimes it hits you right away
And sometimes it takes awhile
Oh but now that you've crept up on me
There's nothing I can do to stay away from you though Lord
I've tried to keep it down
But resistance only moves it to the front
So I got to tell you now and not worry what you'll say
She accepted credit for something she did not do
She said she'd done the water color in her bedroom
But it was done by a friend from school
No one would discover
At least not very soon
When she wasn't looking it just slipped on by
In a restaurant where she worked the late night shift
She short changed a sailor and made five
You could never really call it a theft
Swept up in her apron and kept as a well deserved gift
When she wasn't looking it just slipped on by
She cheated on her lover and placed it in the back of her mind
As long as nobody knew the truth about her
It could never really be unkind
That slipped beside her as she tossed and turned in her alibis
When she wasn't looking it just slipped on by
When she wasn't looking it just slipped on by
Well it's plain as rain
And it's there for all the world to see
That doesn't make it right for me
Someone is making plans
Living in a two time town
Now the place I come from
People don't grow on trees
And you can't treat people like meat
Without getting brought to your knees
The way I've been feeling
Since I hit this town
Like to jump in the river and drown
Feeling like a one man woman
Living in a two time town
To get out on the floor
Like to teach him the bump
Make me want to take him home
I don't mean to preach no lectures
Yeah but me and my man won't
Be able to stay for breakfast
I guess he's got the itch
Who's trying to bring him down
Feeling like a one man woman
Acting like a one man woman
Let's make love for old times sake.
Let's set right an old mistake.
Let's invite our hearts to break.
And to realize that we still care.
Let's make love for old times sake.
Let's set right an old mistake.
Let's invite our hearts to break.
Our destinies always entwined.
And you wound up leaving me behind.
Let's make love for old times sake.
Let's set right an old mistake.
Let's invite our hearts to break.
Let's make love for old times sake.
Let's set right an old mistake.
Let's invite our hearts to break.
But just for old time's sake...
It's right tonight for old time's sake.
I can smell the passion of another man on your breath
You throw your misdemeanors right up in my face
You've taken your half out of the middle
But now I'm damned if I'll give you and itch
If you think you're alone
That you're the only one who is afraid
And sometimes I stand back
I feel just like you do
I feel just like you do
I feel just like you do
I feel just like you do
I feel just like you do
And when it comes to love
You want me to be the one to say
But I feel just like you do
But let's try to return
To that brave innocence we once knew
I wish you were an ocean
I've lived in all of the houses he's built
We're so close we can dispense with houses
We don't need a home at all
It's come to be a habit with me to dine alone
And the evenings end so early
There's no distance at all.
Turn on the headlights
You haven't listened at all.
I'm stuck with acting out a part.
We don't need words at all.
There's a husky voice
That speaks to me in the dark
And on the phone from studios
Through tunnels of long distance.
We're so close we can dispense with love
Last night you called me from Arkansas
Lovers and lawyers in Arkansas
They expect me to go before a judge and stand there shaking
While my heart is breaking
Lovers and lawyers in Arkansas
Oh I'm gonna get a judge who is a lady
Maybe she knows about having a baby.
The wind is coming up strong and fast
And the moon is smiling on me
Miles from nowhere so small at last
In between the sky and the sea
I'm bound for the island
I think I can make it before dawn
It's night on the ocean
And it feels like I've never
Seagulls cry and the hills are green
And my friends are waiting for me
I'm bound for the ocean
I think I can make it by dawn
It's night on the ocean
And it feels like I've never
Oh it feels like I've never
I can barely see your sneakers
You say I got to keep my head down
You're painting my portrait
But do you know what I'll do
Do you know what I'll do
The kind you won't mind
The kind there could be trouble in
I can barely see your sneakers
You know they look pretty rough
Well I bet when you get loaded
You can get pretty tough
You pass me the caviar
But do you know what I'll do
Do you know what I'll do
The kind you won't mind
The kind there could be trouble in
I can barely see your sneakers
You're dripping paint all over the place
Why not get right to the point
But do you know what I'll do
When I go out on the street.
The kind you won't mind
The lies that you tell will leave you alone
They'll catch you and trip you up
Go on and kiss it goodbye
I want to show you my heart
I want to know you by heart
And love you by heart
I'm right here beside you
There's nobody else to set you straight
I want to show you my heart
I want to know you by heart
And love you by heart
I know you by your eyes
I think I know what's inside
The streets you've been on
Will leave you out in the cold
Here I've shown you my heart
I want to know you by heart
I'm so intrigued by you
I'm so intrigued by you
You have your reputation in this town
For dressing up and letting people down
You were flying high the night we met
I was just another stranger in your bed
And a woman from a passion play
Held up the limousine that brought me
All this way today. And I didn't need to turn around
In some low down part of town
And brandy splattered all over the ground
As this woman with her head held high
His eyes fixed on the ground. And he didn't even turn around
Sitting in a car here
After a party where we've seen
Everyone we've known for years
Well I've known you for years
Oh but now it's all changed
And all of my feelings
We can take of the phone
You can take of my clothes
Say that it feels good
Maybe too good to say that it feels like a dream
You want to knock on some wood
Well I'll give you some wood
And I'll give you some fire
And I will show you my desire
We'll have a few laughs
You can stay overnight
I'll give you some wood
Breaking all of the records and rules
The stage is your own bedroom
I have your poster close to my bed
Earphones glued to my head
But I'd rather have you in my arms instead
And I'd be better than I was before
I'd feel so important
I want to be near you
There I got to meet you
And your gold glitter fell all over me
Then I shook your hand
I told my friends that you were just a man
None of that phony star stuff
And I'm better than I was before
Now that I'm holding you
What shall we do about them
They take over but good
They want you all body and soul
Then it's just your body
What shall we do about them
What shall we do about them
What shall we do about them
One of them asked me to dine
Then he ate me all up
Got full then he blew me up
I got big and round and lovable
He saw I was immovable
Once I swore I'd never give myself up
I know that them we are not
You could say that I am experienced
Enough to know that they are aliens
Oh Mama say a prayer for me
Don't let him seize me
How can anyone know what you are to me
That I'm in heaven again
Because you've come back to me
And put on cologne and sit by the phone for you
And drink to the heart
Which has a will of its own
They think I've sunk so low
And put on cologne and I will wait by the phone for you
Your voice is like the water
When I lift this shell to my ear
The beauty of your voice
Lifts us from sadness
Let us become like water together
Sit on the edge of my bed as when we
First spent nights together
Your body wrapped around your guitar
Let the music speak for your heart
Let them combine like water and sand
Let them meet the air like drops of rain
These November gray woods
What you just told me
What is all this about
About just being friends
You held me close to you
I didn't tell you what to do
We'd come out here in the soft nights
I was sunburned under you
So you want me to say
Say that I don't love you
How far away all the stars seem
The three of us in the dark
But here I am with the two of you
The three of us in the dark
I didn't hear you walk in the door
You'd called to me years ago
But here I am with the two of you
The three of us in the dark
The eerie sound of one lone fiddle
The wind is finding the tune
And you lying here in the middle
As innocent as the moon
Entangled in embraces that God will never see
Who am I talking about
It all gets so confused
And here I am with the two of you
You imagine when you see her
That she's nothing less that perfect
That she has no aspirations
Beyond driving in her car
The car she looks so good in
Will she ever look that good again
You'll never have to know
She passes in the left lane
And you're turned on by the chase
Her hair flies in the wind
As your mind begins to race
The grass is always greener
But I wish you could have seen her
Drunk and lying with the gutter in her face
For the woman that I am
You think she knows the bible
Writes novels in her spare time
In a cabin in the woods
You wish I'd gone to college
And you wish I'd let my hair grow
You wish I didn't have so many moods
For the woman that I am
Once you said you were in love with me
And maybe you still are
But the passion you once showed me
Now is lost among the stars
And you fancy some new fancy girl
Will come and change your life around
But she just turned the corner in her car
I am that romantic stranger
More mysterious by far
Speeding through his dreams
For the woman that I am
Amazed by all that sand
I as in a sea of white
Swimming through the land
All that happened was the white night
The endless sand in the moonlight
In the opalescent moon
And waiting for the moon
Nobody walked up to me
All that happened was the white night
The endless sand in the moonlight
Looking in the mirror
And seeing just the sky
Nobody said what to me
All that happened was the white night
Last of the coming up
Looks like I'm down here to stay
My senses have all been run
And there's nothing left of the used to be
But the weeping that's just begun
That sour taste too late
But now I duck my head
And no cradle rocks this empty bed
Then I guess I'm doing wrong
So I sing this crying song
You packed it in too soon
You lose me but not your nerve
Well I guess I know it's what I deserve
Crazy to think that I could keep you on reserve
And so the curtain falls
No matter how you treat me now
I'll be around when she's gone
And if you find a love like mine
And when things go wrong
Perhaps you'll see you're meant for me
And I'll be around when she's gone
Though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him
Never treats me sweet and gentle
And when the weekend's over
And Monday rolls around
I end up like I start out
Just crying my heart out
He don't love me like I love him
I get along without you very well
Except when the soft rains fall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms
But I get along without you very well
I've forgotten you just like I should
Except to hear your name
Or someone's laugh that is just the same
But I've forgotten you just like I should
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon
Should I fall once more
No it's best that I stick to my tune
I get along without you very well
Except perhaps in Spring
But I should never think of Spring
My heart is sad and lonely
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul
I spend my days in longing
It's me you're wronging
I'm all for you body and soul
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
It looks like the ending
Unless you'd give me one more chance
My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours just for the taking
To think that you lied to me
Way down deep inside of me
And it breaks my heart
Much more than you'll ever know
Because I still love you so
But even though you hurt me
Like nobody else could do
One of us slipped last night
There in the middle of the night
Between dream and sleep
Did you say it or did I
But it interrupted the war
One of us slipped last night
There in the middle of the madness
Between the dark and the light
Who cares if all the doors had been closed
And no love had entered for days
Cold wars like these go up in a blaze
Through the haze of the dream
The truth could come through
You can see that I'm still
Once there was a thing called Spring
When the world was writing
Verses like yours and mine
All the boys and girls would sing
As we sat at little tables and drank May wine
Seem sadly out of tune
Life has stuck a pin in the balloon
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
And even those who do know
Back when you were in your prime
Love was just a waste of time
Once you'd flirt discreetly
Now you give completely
That's pretty strange
You can try to play at love
But although you doubt it
You can't live without it
That's pretty strange
And even those who do know
Love can make you cry sometimes
Make you want to die sometimes
Love is so much fun then
I know I'm not what you wanted
Not what you had in mind
And I didn't come close
To the mark You'd set
For the girl you'd planned to find
You've never seen me cry
We shared but idle words
And what shall we do with the child
Reminding me that we fell in love
But just for a little while
You never asked about the girl you never knew
And while she was sleeping in my arms
She never asked about you
Without you seems the only way
But time has passed and now
She'll soon be asking questions
And she'll ask about you
Shall I say to the child
Reminding me that we fell in love
But just for a little while
What shall we do with the child
But you're somewhere a part of my life
And it looks like you'll stay
I keep thinking when does it end
Where's the day I'll have started forgetting
But I just go on thinking and sweating
And cursing and crying
And turning and reaching
But you're still somehow part of my life
And you won't go away
So there's hell to pay
I'll die day after day after day
After day after day after day
The night is filled with pretty girls
Dancing shoes and flying hair
Not one of them would refuse
To follow you up the stairs
You could have your pick of them
Why decide to pick on me
You promised me you'd stay away
You promised me you'd set me free
Trembling of my hands
Somethings I'll just never understand
You know what to do to me
You know what it does to me
You know what to do to me
You know what it does to me
The night is filled with shooting stars
I pray that you won't call at all
I'm still awake at ten to three
I hear your motorcycle roar
You pull up short outside my door
I don't know how I got outside
I don't know why I'm on this ride
We make love like a house on fire
We make love like dogs gone mad
Somethings I'll just never understand
Pounding out my heart
Trembling of my hands
I'd like to see him again
On the jetty in the rain.
When the fishing boats would
At the end of the day
He'd run up the hill to my cabin
The sunset on the sound
Were almost too much to take
We would dance on the hill
Till the morning would break
Everybody drank too much beer
And Peter and me we'd pull the shades
Everyone was interested
Don't be a stubborn man
Don't leave me in the cold
Is know what I've done wrong
All I want to know is what to do
When I can't get to you
There's too much long distance
And tonight I need you
You've opened up my heart
You led me by the hand
You took me slow so I would understand
Every day and every night
We'll be together with a roof
We'll share the shelter of my single bed
God will provide the bread
So I throw my cards on the table
Everyday and every night
We'll be together with a roof
We'll share the shelter of my single bed
We'll share the same room
God will provide the bread
I wanna treat you right
Everyday and every night
We'll be together with a roof right over our heads
We'll share the same room
You could have held me again
You said your songs had all gone
And that the road back up was too long
I loved you all along
The part of me that died
Was ready to be reborn
And you called of the hounds
Of hell with your songs
You could have held me again
Somewhere along the road
Out of despair and believing
You gave up on my love
I loved you all along
Two lovers with the best intentions to stay
Together they the decide to separate
But it happens everyday
Turn him into a robber
But I don't regret that I loved you
How I loved you I will never forget
And in time I'll look back and remember
The boy that I knew when we first met.
Still it happens everyday
Two lovers turn and twist their love into hate
But am I so different
He asks her for permission
He asks her for permission
She treats him like a toy
He asks her for permission
He asks her for permission
She points her finger
And acts just like a Queen bee
When he was a young man
With a face like an old photograph
She would fall for him
She wore her mother's cocktail dress
She was pretty and she was small
She worked the switchboard
Down the hall from him
And that was how the wooing
And the winning began
Of course New York in those days
He took her to a ball
At the Waldorf Astoria
He would fall for her
You could hear them laugh
As they danced in their room
And the shadows on the avenue
Rose into a jealous moon
Which swung low in the dawn like
To see what was going on with those two
You keep on expecting
Something to go wrong
They still live in the house
Hanging up all over the walls
And some say he built his empire
He'll say he did it all for her
And I remember times when I was your storm
I remember when you were looking up at me
Like I was the only one
That you'd ever wanna see
When you've already gone
There's no one to blame
It's just that you don't feel the same
The balance has changed
First she sees her hypnotist
When she rushes to her psychiatrist
She sees her acupuncturist
She's got to got to get fixed
Gets fed by her nutritionist
She can not seem to resist
Seeking cosmic consciousness
Looks like she's floundering again
Seems to be floundering again
Looks like she's floundering again
Seems to be floundering again
Then she throws the I Ching again
She searches in the Himalayas
For someone to ease the pain
She's looking for a cure
She does not know exactly what for
She's into political activism
He never makes me feel ashamed
He bounces me high up on his back
He gives me the gold hat when I'm jump attacked
He loves me more than you ever did
My new boyfriend isn't just some kid
He call in the trumpets for a laugh
He show me the way it was in Spain
He give me the golly when I'm too insane
He loves me more than you ever did
My new boyfriend isn't just a baby
My new boyfriend isn't just some kid
He loves the living daylights out of me
He springs a ladder to the moon
He sings the far side of the tune
He can swim under the covers
He's a diver and a dreamer
He's a dolphin in the ocean
We were up on the roof laughing at the heat
That was the last I ever saw of you
No more rainbows over Central Park
In this house no window has a view
There's no love here without you
When you gonna come back home
When you gonna see it's been too long
When you gonna come back home to me
I'm holding my breath half expecting to see
Which way your heart's gonna go
I only pray it leads you back to me
My faith in love has been my guiding light
I fell in love with you though we were miles apart
Tonight and forever I am yours
Tie a bunch of wild thorn branches
And scatter roses on the floor
Three bright stars shining at our door
And a song on the wind
Now the night is ours
When you got a pretty boy
When you got a smart one
When you got one who's all over you
You wish he'd hold back
Then when he's being cool
You want him to attack
Thinks of nothing but herself
She's just a spoiled girl
Thinks of nothing but herself
Someone's there to do your hair
When you wear it up or down
Send the chauffeur into town
You'll have a lot of fun tonight
Now you're gonna call him up
He waits and waits but no such luck
Thinks of nothing but herself
She's just a spoiled girl
Thinks of nothing but herself
Break your heart and won't regret it
There is just no safe in a...
Thinks of nothing but herself
She's just a spoiled girl
Thinks of nothing but herself
She's just a spoiled girl
Thinks of nothing but herself
She left the credit cards under her goodbye note
Keys to the Porsche she dropped on the floor in the den
She was just leaving a life that a lot of women wish they had
Tired of running around with the usual guys and gals
Tired of living up to all he expected
Tired of living a life that had only been planned by one
Tired of letting her dreams go neglected
She used to love to know she rounded out his world
She used to love to be all he ever loved in a girl
He liked to buy her clothes that made her sexy and cute
Guess she decided she'd been too long away from her roots
She just knew in her heart they had drained her of all that she had
Tired of all the platinum frustration
Tired of chasing all the latest sensations
She was just leaving a life that a lot of women wish they had
Tired of living a life that had only been planned by one
Tired of coping with the desperation
Tired of fighting back the feeling inside that told her to run
He figures out a restaurant
Where they won't be recognized
Get a private little table and try her on for size
Make a plan of where to do it when
That they moved up to Connecticut
That they moved up to Connecticut
The first year I was faithful
He confesses to the girl
Admitting to the least of his sins
She falls for it and once again he wins
The five flight walk up
He keeps promising to go back to the gym
He thinks about his wife
So passionate last night
Or the carpenter who put up the shelves
Or the mechanic who fixed the wagon
Or the gardener who dug the well
Or the Italian riding instructor
Or the man on the Carousel
Or the out of work actor in Westport
Or the surgeon who cured the ills
Or the farmer in the Dell
The lifeguard at the yacht club
The hairdresser from New London
The tennis pro from Fairfield
The Fuller Brush man from Bristol
The fisherman from Mystic
The usher at the movie theater
Straight from the hall of fame
One of the worlds great lovers
Darling you're not to blame
I'm just sorry that you've been discovered
When I look in you eyes
I know hundreds of girls have been there
I tried to be civilized
And pretend I don't care
I need you to show me
We'll be like Adam and Eve
I wish you had never loved anyone but me
Breathless and overcome
Passion can make you dumb
But does so much to keep you going
Turn off the songs of the past romance and
I need you to show me
We'll be like Adam and Eve
I wish you had never loved anyone but me
With too many options
But now that you've dropped I'm gonna pick you up
And love you until we just can't stop
A sweet young man sat on my chair
With a tape machine and a face of fear
He asked how does it feel to be who you are
I answered him with humility
And then asked him if he'd like some tea
Are you interviewing me
Or am I interviewing you
I watched his arms and how his lips moved
He asked me if my parents approved
He asked to see my Ruby ring
And if as a child I had liked to sing
Are you interviewing me
Or am I interviewing you
But how would it feel to hold me in your arms
You could get to know me down on the farm
Then you could see me as the child I've become
Are you interviewing me
Make me feel something
I used to feel something for you
But I've been sleep walking
Make me feel something
Can it be I'm growing old
Maybe I'm just too controlled
I'm much too young to feel this old
I used to take chances for you
But now I'm longing to feel passion
Dying for a happy end
What a good actress I could be
We were fresh in love
Your eyes were pale like the moon
We'd sit on the porch in Summer
Listen to the breezes
I dressed you up like a god
I've been saying that I'm
Leave well enough alone
Like I'm begging you for a bone
When it feels good you can't help it
You just hang by the phone
And it felt that good last night
You come on like a prince
You got everyone convinced
That you've a prince of a man
But I'm the one who knows you
I'm the one you show that you
I've been dreaming you fall in love with me
No cold blooded scheming
If it could be that easy
But you still fight it
That I have to reach for what I want
And as long as it feels that good
I don't want to want you
I don't want to want you
You may think I'm dumb
Or you may think you're sly
When you'll have your day
Next time maybe I'll be the girl
She won't meet my stare
You pretend she's not there
The players are different
But the moves they're the same
Now I don't feel undone
And I don't feel afraid
There's nothing quite so cold
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
So don't mind if I fall apart
You kiss the host goodbye
Then you break a window
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
So don't mind if I fall apart
And I believe in love
But what else can I do
I'm so in love with you
It's coming around again
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It will be coming around again
But it's coming around again
I have no need of half of anything
Give me all the earth and sky
Half the truth is of no use
Give me the full moon
And if I can't take the whole of you
Till the last star fades
Take it from me anyway
As long as you'll join me in that emotion
Give me the full moon
And if I can't take the whole of you
Till the last star fades
Take it from me anyway
Don't leave me guessing alone
Don't walk me half the way home
You can do that tomorrow
Give me the full moon
And if I can't take the whole of you
Till the last star fades
Do the walls come down
Do your eyes grow dim
Do the walls come down
Nothing like a rainy night
Nothing like a vivid dream
To take you back again
Do your eyes grow dim
Do the walls come down
Something in my pocket
That was written years ago
Is it easier for you to say
You never loved me anyway
Or do you hide me in your attic trunk
You had better hold on
Hold on to what you've got
You had better hold on
Hold on to what you've got
Somebody else will have it
Before you can count 1-2-3
You take love for granted
And it's gone like a bandit
And this loneliness cuts like a knife
When you see what you've lost
I think of you now and then
But I remember when love was new
So why would we pretend
We were lovers and now we're friends
I don't want to say goodbye to you
It should have been me
I needed you but how was I to know
It should have been me
That's holding you through all the lonely nights
What we once had is gone
The more we see the less we know
Now you believe our love will grow
With another broken heart
Take a look around now
Try a new translation
Don't look at your man in the same old way
Just because you don't see shooting stars
Doesn't mean it isn't perfect
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
It's the slow and steady fire
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
It's your heart and soul's desire
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
She's got a brand new shiny boy
And they're moving out to Malibu
To play with all his pretty toys
And you feel closed in by the same four walls
The same old conversation
With the same old guy you've know for years
But use your imagination
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
It's the slow and steady fire
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
It's your heart and soul's desire
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
What if the Prince on the horse in your fairytale
Is right here in disguise
And what if the stars you've been reaching so high for
Are shining in his eyes
Don't look at yourself in the same old way
Shoot the stars off in your own backyard
Don't look any further
With all the innocence of tender years
But somewhere down the road ahead
I could see the same eyes
Filled with bitter tears
I had the inclination
To tell her not to drop her guard
To tell her that life can be hard
But I didn't have the heart
You have to get by the best you can
You won't know about love
And the reason you're alive
But I couldn't stand to hear this anymore
Too naive to really see
Maybe she knew better than me
It was better just to let her be
Thinking love runs smooth
You don't know the half of it
We laugh until we lose
What do the neighbors say
When they hear us scream at night
Do they talk about a love
What do the neighbors know
About the heart and soul
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane we got here
I don't want a man who says
All that I want is you
Make me crazy like the moon
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane that we share
I don't want a man who
Tiptoes up the stairs
All that I want is you
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane that we share
I don't want a man who
Tiptoes up the stairs
And your freight train
And your Mack truck loving
You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
And when two lovers woo
They still say I love you
The world will always welcome lovers
And man must have his mate
It's still the same old story
The fight for love and glory
The world will always welcome lovers
It happened last night we were feeling adventurous
We put on our heels and went out for a walk
More for a drink and to have a few eyes on us
Jenny and I slipped to town for some talk
Two hot girls on a hot summer night
I got excited but Jenny was quick
Two hot girls on a hot summer night
A song on the jukebox made me feel lonely
The kettle boiled down and evaporated me
And Dwight was all over her like a honey bee
Two hot girls on a hot summer night
Maybe I shouldn't have worn such a long dress
Maybe he thinks I'm too young or too old
If only I hadn't been born with these sad eyes
Perhaps I'm too shy or too bold
Two hot girls on a hot summer night
And I waved goodnight
I wondered why it wasn't me
I guess it's just that the time's not right
Down come the rain and washed the spider out
Out come the sun and dried up all the rain
Down come the rain and washed the spider out
Out come the sun and dried up all the rain
And I believe in love
And who knows where or when
But it's coming around again
Down come the rain and washed the spider out
Out come the sun and dried up all the rain
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
Down come the rain and washed the spider out
Out come the sun and dried up all the rain
Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
But somehow you found me
But like heaven above me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight
And nobody does it better
Though sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
The way that you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from running
But just keep it coming
And nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
You walked into the party
Like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror as
You watched yourself gavotte
And all the boys dreamed that they'd be your partner
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
When I was still quite naive
When you said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
And your horse naturally won
To see the total eclipse of the sun
And when you're not you're with
Some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
You probably think this song is about you
You probably think this song is about you
Two lovers with the best intentions to stay
Together they the decide to separate
But it happens everyday
Turn him into a robber
But I don't regret that I loved you
How I loved you I will never forget
And in time I'll look back and remember
The boy that I knew when we first met.
Still it happens everyday
Two lovers turn and twist their love into hate
But am I so different
We can never know about the days to come
But we think about them anyway.
And I wonder if I'm really with you now
Or just chasing after some finer day
Is keeping me waiting
And I tell you how easy it feels to be with you
And how right your arms feel around me.
But I rehearsed those words just late last night
When I was thinking about how right tonight might be.
Is keeping me waiting
And tomorrow we might not be together
So I'll try and see into your eyes right now
You're with me now and as long as you stay
I know you've had some bad luck with ladies before
They drove you or you drove them crazy
But more important is I know you're the one and I'm sure
And it used to be for a while
That the river flowed right to my door
Making me just a little too free
But now the river doesn't seem to stop here anymore
Hold me in your hands like a bunch of flowers
And I know what I think I've known all along
Nothing you could ever do would turn me away from you
I love you now and I love you now
Even though you're ten thousand miles away
I'll love you tomorrow as I love you today
Do the walls come down
Do your eyes grow dim
Do the walls come down
Nothing like a rainy night
Nothing like a vivid dream
To take you back again
Do your eyes grow dim
Do the walls come down
Something in my pocket
That was written years ago
Is it easier for you to say
You never loved me anyway
Or do you hide me in your attic trunk
Were you looking for my reaction
What do you need to know
Don't you know I'll always be your girl
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
Thought we'd closed the book
You don't have to prove to me that you're beautiful to strangers
It happened last night we were feeling adventurous
We put on our heels and went out for a walk
More for a drink and to have a few eyes on us
Jenny and I slipped to town for some talk
Two hot girls on a hot summer night
I got excited but Jenny was quick
Two hot girls on a hot summer night
A song on the jukebox made me feel lonely

And Dwight was all over her like a honey bee
Two hot girls on a hot summer night

And your freight train
And your Mack truck loving
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
So don't mind if I fall apart
There's more room in a broken heart
Then you break a window
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
So don't mind if I fall apart
There's more room in a broken heart
And I believe in love
But what else can I do
I'm so in love with you
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
And who knows where or when
But if you're willing to play the game
The wind is coming up strong and fast
And the moon is smiling on me
Miles from nowhere so small at last
In between the sky and the sea
I'm bound for the island
I think I can make it before dawn
It's night on the ocean
And it feels like I've never
Seagulls cry and the hills are green
And my friends are waiting for me
I'm bound for the ocean
I think I can make it by dawn
It's night on the ocean
And it feels like I've never
Oh it feels like I've never
My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
My romance doesn't need a thing but you
I'll go my way by myself
This is the end of romance
I'll go my way by myself
I'll face the unknown
I'll build a world of my own
No one knows better than I myself
I see your face before me
Clouding my every dream
There is your face before me
You are my only theme
It doesn't matter where you are
I can see how fair you are
I close my eyes and there you are
If you could share the magic
If you could see me too
There would be nothing tragic
In all my dreams of you
Would that my love could haunt you so
Knowing I want you so
What good is the scheming
The planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair
The love that you cherish
So often might perish
And leave you with castles in air
Who cares for starlit skies
The magic moonlight dies
When your lover has gone
The evening shadows bring
With memories lingering
Life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone
When your lover's gone
When the sun is high in the afternoon sky
You can always find something to do
But from dusk till dawn as the clock ticks on
Something happens to you
In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the boy
And never ever think of counting sheep
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be his if only he'd call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss him most of all
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be his if only he'd call
In the wee small hours of the morning
You make me smile with my heart
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak are you smart
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
He may not always say
What you would have him say
But now and then he'll say something wonderful
The thoughtless things he'll do
Will hurt and worry you
Then all at once he'll do something wonderful
He has a thousand dreams that won't come true
You know that he believes in them
And that's enough for you
You'll always go along with
Defend him when he's wrong
And tell him when he's strong
He'll always need your love
And so you'll get you're love
A man who needs your love
When I was very young
The world was younger than I
As merry as a carousel
The circus tent was strong with every star in the sky
Above the ring I loved so well
Now the young world has grown old
Gone are the tinsel and the gold
Sit there and count your fingers
Sit there and count your little fingers
Unlucky little girl blue
Sit there and count the raindrops
It's time that you knew
All you can count on is the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue
No use old girl you may as well surrender
You hope is getting slender
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy
To cheer a little girl blue
No use old girl you may as well surrender
Your hope is getting slender
Why won't somebody lend a tender
There goes my young intended
I'll never find another half so sweet
And we'll never meet again
Sad eyes out in the rain
He was too good to me
How can I get along now
So close he stood to me
Everything seems all wrong now
He would have brought me the sun
When I was mean to him
He'd never say go away now
Who's gonna make me gay now
It's only natural that I'm blue
I've got eyes they call beguiling
A string of cultured pearls
And my lips are always smiling
I'm not one of those moody girls
As Balanchine's last prodigy
A one time runner up Miss USA
What has she got that I haven't got
Why am I not he girl that makes you heart go dancing
Puts stars in all your dreams
She's everything you want and I'm just me
What has she got that I haven't got
I've got a bed that's warm
I've got a room that's sunny
Kisses so honey sweet
I try everything to sweep you off your feet
Do you like her kind of trouble
Does she bring you to your knees
Have I been playing you all wrong
Always trying to please you
What has she got that I haven't got
He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a week
Since this half pint imitation's
A simpering whimpering child again
I couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
Until love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Oh I lost my heart but what of it
Oh but he can laugh and I love it
And worship the trousers that cling to him
And long for the day I'll cling to him
But come you back when summer's in the meadow
Or all the valley's hushed and white with snow
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or all the valley's hushed and white with snow
Then if you bend and tell me that you love me
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you
The one you run to see
I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You'll hear me say that I'm
Better not make her jealous of me
Better convince her there was nothing between us
I'm not those initials in your diary
But if you slip and my name comes up
Don't deny that you knew me
Just leave out the white nights
The moon in your window
The break in your whisper
Better not tell her why you love Spanish dancing
Don't bother to say that it's hot in the summer in Madrid
Like the trace of a song that you hear in the wind
But if you slip and my name comes up
Don't deny that you knew me
Just leave out the white nights
The moon in your window
The break in your whisper
Leave out the tears and the laughter
She won't need to know
That I cried when you left
That I think of you still
But if you slip and my name comes up
Don't deny that you knew me
Just leave out the white nights
The moon in your window
The break in your whisper
Leave out the tears and the laughter
She won't need to know
That I'd die for your love
Didn't I give you the month of June
Didn't I make it all right
When everything was ruined
Didn't I say didn't I
Didn't you say Didn't I too
Didn't we both say Didn't I
Till didn't we say we're through
Sorry that your mother dropped you on your head
Maybe her mother dropped her too
In the end we all get dropped
We all get black and blue
But didn't I always love you long
When time was short and the night was cold
Didn't I admit that I was wrong
When the anger was new but the fight was old
Didn't I say didn't I
Till didn't we say we're through
Are you gonna catch me
Don't wake me unless you love me
It takes too long to fall back to sleep
Don't wake me unless you're a friend of mine
I'd rather just fall back on my dreams
Don't wake me unless you love me
It takes too long to fall back to sleep
Don't wake me unless you're a friend of mine
I'd rather just fall back on my dreams
I've been doing a lot of thinking
About growing older and moving on
Nobody wants to be told that they're getting on
But just how long and who knows
And how and where my spirit will go
Will it soar like Jazz on a saxophone
Or evaporate on a breeze
Won't you tell me please
And death is only a horizon
As we move into the light
And a horizon is nothing
Save the limit of our sight
Save the limit of our sight
Here on earth I'm a lost soul
Ever trying to find my way back home
Maybe that's why each new star is born
Expanding heaven's room
And will I see you up in that heaven
In all it's light will I know you're there
Will we say the things that we never dared
If wishing makes it so
Won't you let me know
And death is only a horizon
As we move into the light
And a horizon is nothing
Save the limit of our sight
Still I would never have guessed that you'd wind up here
Waiting at the gate when they let you out
You've been through hell I know what that's all about
Waiting at the gate when they let you out
The doctors have so little faith
They say you were a classic case
They said the chance is eight in ten
They'd see you back in here again
But I'm counting on you to prove the doctors wrong
Looking like a baby picture of you
And I'll be waiting waiting
It's all of our birthdays this summer
We've given up caffeine and sworn off desserts
Stay in perfect shape and be number one
We've got brilliant excuses for having no fun
Make love in the microwave
Think of all the time you'll save
And don't forget to make it look
As though you're working very very hard
But I'll be your lover if you will be mine
We'll go back to the garden and have a good time
And just blow out the candles
You say you're not worthy of me
But how do you know when you can't see
Your eyes where midnight catches fire
I can't describe this dizzy desire
Can you be so insecure
That you don't know what this grin is for
Do you think I always act this way
When you're holding me tonight
You think it's all a mistake
That I'm lost in a dream from which I'll wake up
There you'll be just another guy
You could never be but I dare you to try
When you're holding me
I walk into your room
You blush when I see it in a mess
So I undress and close my eyes
Is in the dark with you
But that should come as no surprise
It's not a matter of mind
The choice of the heart is a different kind
It's always been a mystery
When you walk into the room It happens to me
And when you're holding me
When Tom came home his hair was combed
It isn't just the way he's dressed
He smiles out of context and acts so polite
He's staying at his cousin's overnight
And the sweet name he called me in his sleep last night
He whispers on the telephone
He goes out smelling of cologne
It's just a superficial thing
But he's misplaced his wedding ring
He's become quite a connoisseur of wine
He's quoting Yeats and Gertrude Stein
And the sweet name he called me in his sleep last night
I caught a glimpse of Tom today
He had a girl on his arm
I'm glad he's helping out the poor
It's not like the Tom I knew before
Something so touching it made me cry
And the sweet name he called me in his sleep last night
And several more of these
So I'll like it if you please
So I'll help myself to love
And have the whole career
Class and wit and style
Attracting you with guile
I've got nothing to lose
Gather round and cheer
I've stood there patiently waiting in line
If you've got lots of time
Especially if he's biodegradable
I ain't nobody's princess
I ain't nobody's fool
So I'll help myself to love
There's nothing more to fear
In a pine forest cooler
Than the rest of the island
Lives a young fisherman
With eyes like the sea
He built his own boat
And made his own cabin
But he's broken the hearts
Now you must understand
There were secrets we shared
We lived in his cabin
I fished along side of him
I fell under the spell
When he cast me adrift
At the end of the summer
It was not for another
I fell apart like a rose
But the scent of my longing
Like an old willow tree
At night when its still
With the yellow moon rising
When his candle is snuffed
And he's deep in a dream
And crawl into his window
And lie down beside him
In a golden moon beam
The smell of his skin
Is just like the summer
When our love was as fresh
As the grass in the fields
Though I'm in it alone
I'm still in it in love
And love can be lonely
But just maybe he feels me
Like a whisper inside him
Like an angel beside him
There are a few more freckles on your shoulders
The hammock swings lower and touches the grass
The apples are ripe and the corn is past
Everyone says summer goes by so fast
I can hardly believe it but it's ended
The beach is a haze and old love's a ghost
Hugo is twisting his way up the coast
If you blew out to sea I'd love you most
The time that you take could make another heart whole
Could the truth be I won't really see
The two of us left here alone in the house
You bleed the pipes while I bring in the plants
I love lilacs and avocados
Ukuleles and fireworks
And Woody Allen and walking in the snow
But you've got to know
You're the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
From the moment I first saw you
The second that you were born
I knew that you were the love of my life
Quite simply the love of my life
I love Lucy and pumpernickel bread
The Statue of Liberty and standing ovations
But get it through your head
You're the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
From the moment I first saw you
The second that you were born
I knew that you were the love of my life
Quite simply the love of my life
You can drive me crazy
You can drive me anywhere
Just do as you please
It may not always be easy
But you're the love of my life
My heart is riding on a runaway train
You are the love of my life
Through all the pleasure and pain
From the moment I first saw you
I knew that you were the love of my life
Simply the love of my life
Back the way it was before
Before the door was opened
Back the way it was before
Before the ice was broken
Back the way it used to be
Everyone thought I was funny
But nobody ever asked me
If I wanted tiny little sandwiches
Back the way it was before
Everyone thought I was okay
But now I'm scintillating
Back the way it used to be
Some people thought I was pretty
But not many passes were made at me
Back the way it was before
But now my prayers are answered
And my star is on the rise
Everyone's my best friend
Back the way it used to be
Money was always a tyrant
I spent it all paying my rent
Back the way it used to be
But now my prayers are answered
And my star is on the rise
Everyone's my best friend
Back the way it used to be
Sing a song of long ago
I'm the most dangerous person in this room
I could do some damage to myself
It's your heart against mine
And I fear I may capsize
I'm operating without a license
But I'm willing to pay the price
You've so damned easy on the eyes
The two sides don't synchronize
You've nothing like anyone I've ever seen before
If I'm staring at you then I apologize
You defy every rule I've learned
But still I've never been half so turned on
And you're just so easy
You've so damned easy on the eyes
But I'd have to be blind to try and minimize
How easy you are on the eyes
You're easy on the eyes
You've so easy on the eyes
I'm operating without a license
But I'm willing to pay the price
And you're just so easy
Some folks like to stay at home
Some folks like to be alone
So when they finally come out of their nest
I've got to turn it on
I've got to be my best
The street may be slick with ice
And I'm sick with butterflies
And some other girl may be the talk of the town
I could lose my voice
Or I could split my gown
But when I'm in the spotlight
It's got to be a hot night
Even when I'm feeling down
I've won some and I have lost
But what I enjoy the most
Is never knowing how the evening will end
Will I be the joke or the comedienne
And when I'm in the spotlight
It's got to be a hot night
Even when I'm shivering cold
Your contact lens goes down the drain
When your agent goes insane
When you can hardly stay awake
You'd rather stay at home and bake
To an audience of one
And you think he's got a gun
When laughing isn't any fun
I love lilacs and avocados
Ukuleles and fireworks
And walking in the snow
But you've got to know
That you're the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
From the moment I first saw you
The second that you were born
I knew that you were the love of my life
Quite simply the love of my life
I love Lucy and pumpernickel bread
The Statue Of Liberty
And standing ovations
But get it through your head
That you're the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
From the moment I first saw you
The second that you were born
I knew that you were the love of my life
Quite simply the love of my life
You can drive me crazy
You can drive me anywhere
Just do as you please
It may not always be easy
But you're the love of my life
My heart is riding on a runaway train
You are the love of my life
Through all the pleasure and pain
From the moment I first saw you
I knew that you were the love of my life
Simply the love of my life
Back the way it was before
Before the heart was broken
Back the way it used to be
Talks didn't end in a quarrel
Everything seemed so normal
Back the way it was before
But now the limo pulls up to the door
I forgot the groceries
Back the way it was before
The chicken pox was easy
We told each other everything
Back the way it used to be
When we were a happy family
If we wanted tiny little sandwiches
Children carry through the streets
A brightly painted star
Men of great renown and faith
Say prayers on boulevards
It's the night before Christmas
But you don't have to be an angel
And you don't have to be a child
And you don't have to be a wise man
The heart of this Christmas is in you and me
The night before Christmas
The night before Christmas
If you're heart's been longing
And you've been afraid to try
Sorrow's kept you company
And the dance has passed you by
I'll lift you up and blaze with you
Across the moonlit sky
On the night before Christmas
And you don't have to be a child to love the mystery
And you don't have to be a wise man
The heart of this Christmas is in you and me
The heart of this Christmas is in you and me
The night before Christmas
I love lilacs and avocados
Ukuleles and fireworks
But you've got to know that
You're the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
The second that you were born
I knew that you were the love of my life
Quite simply the love of my life
The statue of liberty and standing ovations
But get it through your head that
You're the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
The second that you were born
I knew that you were the love of my life
Quite simply the love of my life
You an drive me crazy
You can drive me anywhere
Just do as you please
It may not always be easy
But you're the love of my life
My heart is riding on a runaway train
You are the love of my life
Through all the pleasure and pain
I knew that you were the love of my life
Simply the love of my life
In a suitcase tied with string
In the closet down the hall
How peculiar these remain
For some I crumpled some I burned
Some I tore to shreds
Letters never sent to you
Never reached their destination
Resurfaced with the purpose of
A trip down memory lane
Evidence of what I saw
Letters never sent to you
Once upon a time taboo
Letters never sent to you
I'm lost in your love
Lost in my love for you
Everything that you say
Everything that you do
I'm lost in your love
I can find me a night
So lovely it might even change me
I can find me the place where mornings come from
But I'm lost when it comes to you
I'm lost in your love
So lost in my love for you
And I can't see your face
I'm lost in your love
I can't let you go free
I'm lost in your love
Lost in my love for you
Everything that you say
Everything that you do
Dear mother the struggle is over now
And your house is up for sale
We divided your railway watches
Between the four of us
I fought over the pearls
But it was all a metaphor
For what was wrong with us
As the room is emptying out
Your face so young comes into view
And a pool of light you can walk into
That part of our life together is over
Are you dancing with Benjamin Franklin
Last night I swear I could feel you
Moving through my room
And I thought you touched my feet
I so wanted it to be true
In my theater there is a stage
That part of our life together is over
In the river I know I will find the key
And your voice will rise like the spray
In the moment of knowing
The tide will wash away my doubt
Making it nice for when I come home
Like the way I find my bed turned down
Coming in from a late night out.
Please keep reminding me
Of what in my soul I know is true
And two or three stars we can gaze into...
That part of our life together is over
But I will wait for you forever
A star that's always watching
A candle always burning
Time works on all the wild young men
The ones who went for soldiers
The ones who reached for fame
The ones who swore they'd die for love
No matter what the shame
If you want to be brave
And reach for the top of the sky
And the farthest point on the horizon
Do you know who you'll meet there
They need to be in danger of burning by fire
One who is touched by the sun
The safe side of the street
And lull myself to sleep
But deep down inside I know
Let my wings of desire
I need to let them say
One who is touched by the sun
There are ghosts who would warn me
To feel something so worthy
For someone like you...
But if it feels all right
If it feels all right and it feels all right
Thank you for informing me
That I've been banned from Canada
It comes as no surprise to me
Since last week it was Africa
Since you've been ambassador
There's trouble at the border
It's amusing still it makes me wince
Your face is like a scimitar
When accidentally eye to eye
You shoot a look of vinegar
What could I have done to you
To make you act the way you do
I believe it's like some kind of compliment
I must be quite a girl
Once upon a time you swore you'd love me
Till the end of the world
I must be quite a girl
You and me and all the Stones
Wouldn't want to leave them out
Couldn't find a nice bunch
But you can't expect them to
Navigate the boulevards on their own
Those sweet Rolling Stones
The reason I wouldn't kiss you last night
That I'd like you too much
And if I liked you too much
I'd be afraid that I'd give you a present
You might give me a gift
And then I'd be afraid...
That I wouldn't like it
When you look for a reason
And maybe you'll think
It's a really good reason
But I come up with the reasons
You asked me if I'd scratch your back
I wouldn't scratch it
And if I twisted your arm
I'd be afraid that it would lead to passion
And if we got too drunk
We might fall out of the bunk
We would have a concussion
Don't ever live with your real love
Stop before it starts
Real love will last much longer
When you look for the reason
And maybe you'll think
It's a really good reason
But I come up with the reason
I'll never have another chance
At the Parson's dance
Gotta be an apple tree growing in the field
Gotta be at Frankie's house right now
Gotta be at Danny's house deja
Gotta meet a holy man
He'll be in the valley when Amelia tries to land
And I never felt so... never felt so...
Can you be private when the juice is sweet
And the secret is crimson
Can you be quiet when my hands are heat
And live on our desire alone
Can you ride the tide in this insanity
When the cry is so wide on the inside
When the truth jumps quick to the heart
When the wind or the stars are violent
All the wisdom you need
And the hunchback moon
Will keep our memories
Not a living soul will remember us
This is just for you and me
If you want someone bad enough
You can catch it like a fever
But you can catch it like a fever
And you can catch it like a fever
The habit and the curse
You were born to break
You were born to break
You were born to break my heart
The same reaction to the same lies
A most auspicious start
You were born to break my heart
Born to break my heart...
You don't begin to understand
I guess it's time we part
No wonder we looked like the perfect couple
It was brilliantly conceived
It seems I have a yen to lose
And you can't pass up the perfect
Just as stubborn as a fool
You'd think I might get smart
Tonight the sun went down in flames
And the moon rose up in blue
Heaven spoke and called my name
But I'm rather it was you
I'm rather it was you
I'm rather it was you to hold me like the child
I'm like for you to carry me across
I'm rather it was you
I'd rather it was you to hold me like the girl
I'm like to feel your breath upon my skin
I'm like to feel it finally beginning...
One will fit just like a glove
Two will feel like brand new
But you are all these things and more
And I'm rather it was you
We're coming to the edge
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
Let all the dreamers wake the nation
The morning lights the streets that lead them
And sirens call them on with a song
It's asking for the taking
We're coming to the edge
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
We the great and small
And blaze a trail of desire
Through the darkening dawn
It's asking for the taking
You've never even seen
In the eyes of your lover
We're coming to the edge
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
It's asking for the taking
We're coming to the edge
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
Were you looking for my reaction
What do you need to know
Don't you know I'll always be your girl
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
Thought we'd closed the book
You don't have to prove to me that you're beautiful to strangers
Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
But somehow you found me
But like heaven above me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight
And nobody does it better
Though sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
The way that you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from running
But just keep it coming
And nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
So don't mind if I fall apart
You kiss the host goodbye
Then you break a window
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
So don't mind if I fall apart
And I believe in love
But what else can I do
I'm so in love with you
It's coming around again
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It will be coming around again
But it's coming around again
Oh Mama say a prayer for me
Don't let him seize me
How can anyone know what you are to me
That I'm in heaven again
Because you've come back to me
And put on cologne and sit by the phone for you
And drink to the heart
Which has a will of its own
They think I've sunk so low
And put on cologne and I will wait by the phone for you
Take a look around now
Try a new translation
Don't look at your man in the same old way
Just because you don't see shooting stars
Doesn't mean it isn't perfect
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
It's the slow and steady fire
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
It's your heart and soul's desire
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
She's got a brand new shiny boy
And they're moving out to Malibu
To play with all his pretty toys
And you feel closed in by the same four walls
The same old conversation
With the same old guy you've know for years
But use your imagination
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
It's the slow and steady fire
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
It's your heart and soul's desire
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
What if the Prince on the horse in your fairytale
Is right here in disguise
And what if the stars you've been reaching so high for
Are shining in his eyes
Don't look at yourself in the same old way
Shoot the stars off in your own backyard
Don't look any further
You walked into the party
Like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror as
You watched yourself gavotte
And all the boys dreamed that they'd be your partner
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
When I was still quite naive
When you said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
And your horse naturally won
To see the total eclipse of the sun
And when you're not you're with
Some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
You probably think this song is about you
You probably think this song is about you
If you want to be brave
And reach for the top of the sky
And the farthest point on the horizon
Do you know who you'll meet there
They need to be in danger of burning by fire
One who is touched by the sun
The safe side of the street
And lull myself to sleep
But deep down inside I know
Let my wings of desire
I need to let them say
One who is touched by the sun
All those crazy nights when I cried myself to sleep
Now melodrama never makes me weep anymore
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you
How to turn down the noise in my mind
Now I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you
Suffering was the only thing that made me feel I was alive
Though that's just how much it cost to survive in this world
How to open up and drink in all that white love
Pouring down from the heaven
I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Better not make her jealous of me
Better convince her there was nothing between us
I'm not those initials in your diary
But if you slip and my name comes up
Don't deny that you knew me
Just leave out the white nights
The moon in your window
The break in your whisper
Better not tell her why you love Spanish dancing
Don't bother to say that it's hot in the summer in Madrid
Like the trace of a song that you hear in the wind
But if you slip and my name comes up
Don't deny that you knew me
Just leave out the white nights
The moon in your window
The break in your whisper
Leave out the tears and the laughter
She won't need to know
That I cried when you left
That I think of you still
But if you slip and my name comes up
Don't deny that you knew me
Just leave out the white nights
The moon in your window
The break in your whisper
Leave out the tears and the laughter
She won't need to know
That I'd die for your love
Well I have known you
Since you were a small boy
And your mama used to say
Then you'd turn on the radio
And sing with the singer in the band
Your mama would say to you
But you're a legend in your own time
A hero in the footlights
But a legend's only a lonely boy
When he goes home alone.
And though I know you
Still have the heart of that small boy
Can ever feel that she's been really touched
Then you turn on the radio
And sing with the singer in the band
Think kind of sadly to yourself
This isn't exactly what you had planned
But you're a legend in your own time
A hero in the footlights
But a legend's only a lonely boy
When he goes home alone
Well a legend's only a lonely boy
My father sits at night with no lights on
His cigarette glows in the dark
The living room is still
I tiptoe past the master bedroom where
My mother reads her magazines
But I forget how to dream
But you say it's time we moved in together
They have their houses and their lawns
They have their silent noons
Their children hate them for the things they're not
They hate themselves for what they are
But you say it's time we moved in together
You say that we can keep our love alive
The couples cling and claw
And drown in love's debris
You say we'll soar like two birds through the clouds
But soon you'll cage me on your shelf
I'll never learn to be just me first
What do the neighbors say
When they hear us scream at night
Do they talk about a love
What do the neighbors know
About the heart and soul
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane we got here
I don't want a man who says
All that I want is you
Make me crazy like the moon
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane that we share
I don't want a man who
Tiptoes up the stairs
All that I want is you
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane that we share
I don't want a man who
Tiptoes up the stairs
And your freight train
And your Mack truck loving
You're with me now and as long as you stay
I know you've had some bad luck with ladies before
They drove you or you drove them crazy
But more important is I know you're the one and I'm sure
And it used to be for a while
That the river flowed right to my door
Making me just a little too free
But now the river doesn't seem to stop here anymore
Hold me in your hands like a bunch of flowers
And I know what I think I've known all along
Nothing you could ever do would turn me away from you
I love you now and I love you now
Even though you're ten thousand miles away
I'll love you tomorrow as I love you today
Dear mother the struggle is over now
And your house is up for sale
We divided your railway watches
Between the four of us
I fought over the pearls
But it was all a metaphor
For what was wrong with us
As the room is emptying out
Your face so young comes into view
And a pool of light you can walk into
That part of our life together is over
Are you dancing with Benjamin Franklin
Last night I swear I could feel you
Moving through my room
And I thought you touched my feet
I so wanted it to be true
In my theater there is a stage
That part of our life together is over
In the river I know I will find the key
And your voice will rise like the spray
In the moment of knowing
The tide will wash away my doubt
Making it nice for when I come home
Like the way I find my bed turned down
Coming in from a late night out.
Please keep reminding me
Of what in my soul I know is true
And two or three stars we can gaze into...
That part of our life together is over
But I will wait for you forever
A star that's always watching
A candle always burning
We can never know about the days to come
But we think about them anyway.
And I wonder if I'm really with you now
Or just chasing after some finer day
Is keeping me waiting
And I tell you how easy it feels to be with you
And how right your arms feel around me.
But I rehearsed those words just late last night
When I was thinking about how right tonight might be.
Is keeping me waiting
And tomorrow we might not be together
So I'll try and see into your eyes right now
I have no need of half of anything
Give me all the earth and sky
Half the truth is of no use
Give me the full moon
And if I can't take the whole of you
Till the last star fades
Take it from me anyway
As long as you'll join me in that emotion
Give me the full moon
And if I can't take the whole of you
Till the last star fades
Take it from me anyway
Don't leave me guessing alone
Don't walk me half the way home
You can do that tomorrow
Give me the full moon
And if I can't take the whole of you
Till the last star fades
Named after my mother
My old man is another
Child that's grown old
If dreams were thunder
And lightening was desire
Would have burnt down
Just give me one thing
That I can hold on to
To believe in this living
Is just a hard way to go
When I was a young girl
He weren't much to look at
Just a free rambling man
But that was a long time
And no matter how I try
The years just flow by
Like a broken down dam
Just give me one thing
That I can hold on to
To believe in this living
Is just a hard way to go
There's flies in the kitchen
And I ain't done nothing
Since I woke up today
How the hell can a person
Go to work in the morning
And come home in the evening
And have nothing to say
Just give me one thing
That I can hold on to
To believe in this living
Raining for days on end
The Children are restless
They played all their games
Again and again and again
We could call up a friend
And the towels won't dry
Why bother to take all the
Clothes in from the line
Cause tomorrow may be
And the cards won't play
But damned if we stay
Raining for days on end
I would be much obliged
Your lonesome childhood
By the folks back home
But that's all over now
The future looks good
Your hair gets snarled
In what you do not know
To look beyond the deal
I'm the most dangerous person in this room
I could do some damage to myself
It's your heart against mine
And I fear I may capsize
I'm operating without a license
But I'm willing to pay the price
You've so damned easy on the eyes
The two sides don't synchronize
You've nothing like anyone I've ever seen before
If I'm staring at you then I apologize
You defy every rule I've learned
But still I've never been half so turned on
And you're just so easy
You've so damned easy on the eyes
But I'd have to be blind to try and minimize
How easy you are on the eyes
You're easy on the eyes
You've so easy on the eyes
I'm operating without a license
But I'm willing to pay the price
And you're just so easy
We'd rather believe that we decide
That we can stand here
And say loud and clear
Here comes the turn of the tide
Here comes the turn of the tide
We cannot go on sounding alarms
And rattling swords and building bombs
And fouling the air and the streams underground
We've got to begin to turn it around
It's our right to be heard
Here comes the turn of the tide
Here comes the turn of the tide
Now the ocean is calm
And here comes the turn of the tide
It's time to be heard
Here comes the turn of the tide
Here comes the turn of the tide
Here comes the turn of the tide
Here comes the turn of the tide
If all our flights are grounded
Dance along the boulevards
And have no one to embarrass
With an Arab and an Heiress
And leave behind our blues
We'll trade them all in
See how dark the circles grow
In a town that has no light
So many eyes just staring out
Into the bloodshot night
And I want to share it all with you
And if it brings us to our knees
We'll trade it all in for a Paris breeze
They say it don't come easy
And they say that love is blind
If you're afraid to be close
Then love is hard to find
And if you spend too much time winning love
There's no time to be kind
And Libby I'm guilty of your crimes
I'm just another passenger
Traveling on these crazy high seas
Very likely be the same
If all our flights are grounded
Libby we'll go to Paris
And wish we were back home again
Or sailing on the ocean
Just a window and a drink
To set our dreams in motion
Trade them in for a Paris breeze
Are you gonna catch me
Don't wake me unless you love me
It takes too long to fall back to sleep
Don't wake me unless you're a friend of mine
I'd rather just fall back on my dreams
Don't wake me unless you love me
It takes too long to fall back to sleep
Don't wake me unless you're a friend of mine
I'd rather just fall back on my dreams
He never makes me feel ashamed
He bounces me high up on his back
He gives me the gold hat when I'm jump attacked
He loves me more than you ever did
My new boyfriend isn't just some kid
He call in the trumpets for a laugh
He show me the way it was in Spain
He give me the golly when I'm too insane
He loves me more than you ever did
My new boyfriend isn't just a baby
My new boyfriend isn't just some kid
He loves the living daylights out of me
He springs a ladder to the moon
He sings the far side of the tune
He can swim under the covers
He's a diver and a dreamer
He's a dolphin in the ocean
Everybody wants to dance with my daddy
To make you look my way
Everybody wants to dance with my daddy
He can dance the Tango
And samba with his shadow
Pirouette into a minuet
Everybody wants to dance with my daddy
Is walk into the room
Everybody wants to dance with my daddy
Children carry through the streets
A brightly painted star
Men of great renown and faith
Say prayers on boulevards
It's the night before Christmas
But you don't have to be an angel
And you don't have to be a child
And you don't have to be a wise man
The heart of this Christmas is in you and me
The night before Christmas
The night before Christmas
If you're heart's been longing
And you've been afraid to try
Sorrow's kept you company
And the dance has passed you by
I'll lift you up and blaze with you
Across the moonlit sky
On the night before Christmas
And you don't have to be a child to love the mystery
And you don't have to be a wise man
The heart of this Christmas is in you and me
The heart of this Christmas is in you and me
The night before Christmas
Thank you for informing me
That I've been banned from Canada
It comes as no surprise to me
Since last week it was Africa
Since you've been ambassador
There's trouble at the border
It's amusing still it makes me wince
Your face is like a scimitar
When accidentally eye to eye
You shoot a look of vinegar
What could I have done to you
To make you act the way you do
I believe it's like some kind of compliment
I must be quite a girl
Once upon a time you swore you'd love me
Till the end of the world
I must be quite a girl
I've been doing a lot of thinking
About growing older and moving on
Nobody wants to be told that they're getting on
But just how long and who knows
And how and where my spirit will go
Will it soar like Jazz on a saxophone
Or evaporate on a breeze
Won't you tell me please
And death is only a horizon
As we move into the light
And a horizon is nothing
Save the limit of our sight
Save the limit of our sight
Here on earth I'm a lost soul
Ever trying to find my way back home
Maybe that's why each new star is born
Expanding heaven's room
And will I see you up in that heaven
In all it's light will I know you're there
Will we say the things that we never dared
If wishing makes it so
Won't you let me know
And death is only a horizon
As we move into the light
And a horizon is nothing
Save the limit of our sight
We tell each other everything
About the lovers in the past
And why they didn't last
We share a cast of characters from A to Z
We know each other's fantasies
And though we know each other better when we explore
That I never knew some of those secrets of yours
The beach was empty but for one
Now you were lying in the sun
She drank a pint of your rum
And later when you told me
You said she was a bore
That I never knew some of those secrets of yours
You always answer my questions
But they don't always answer my prayers
And though I know you say that it's me that you adore
Some of those secrets of yours
Some of those secrets of yours
Some of those secrets of yours
You know I loved you baby
In the warmth of our bed
All the things that you said were
You said our love was sacred
But you left me alone to make it
You want to come back again someday
You say you'll come back again someday
Take me out to the ball game
Take me out with the crowd
Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks
I don't care if I ever get back
If they don't win it's a shame
Back the way it was before
Before the heart was broken
Back the way it used to be
Talks didn't end in a quarrel
Everything seemed so normal
Back the way it was before
But now the limo pulls up to the door
I forgot the groceries
Back the way it was before
The chicken pox was easy
We told each other everything
Back the way it used to be
When we were a happy family
If we wanted tiny little sandwiches
Down come the rain and washed the spider out
Out come the sun and dried up all the rain
Down come the rain and washed the spider out
Out come the sun and dried up all the rain
And I believe in love
And who knows where or when
But it's coming around again
Down come the rain and washed the spider out
Out come the sun and dried up all the rain
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
Down come the rain and washed the spider out
Out come the sun and dried up all the rain
You can have your fun
Some big time winners
To quit those sinners
Put a smile on my face
That's newly strung in June
My love is like a melody
That's sweetly played in tune
Till all the seas gang dry
Till all the seas gang dry
And the rocks melt with the sun
While the sands of life shall run
And fare thee well a while
Though it were ten thousand miles
Two lovers with the best intentions to stay
Together they the decide to separate
But it happens everyday
Turn him into a robber
But I don't regret that I loved you
How I loved you I will never forget
And in time I'll look back and remember
The boy that I knew when we first met.
Still it happens everyday
Two lovers turn and twist their love into hate
But am I so different
I'm home again in my old narrow bed
Where I grew tall and my feet hung over the end
The low beam room with the window looking out
On the soft summer garden
Where the boys grew in the trees
And no one was at fault
Frightened by the power in every innocent thought
And the silent understanding passing down
Let the boys grow in the trees
Do you go to them or do you let them come to you
Do you stand in back afraid that you'll intrude
Deny yourself and hope someone will see
And live like a flower
While the boys grew in the trees
Tonight I lie alone again and curse my own desires
Sentenced first to burn and then to freeze
And watch by the window
Julie through the glass
You've just got to be
The sweetest thing I've ever seen.
Julie through the glass
And who knows where you've been
And where you're gonna go.
We want you to love the world
To know it well and play a part
And we'll help you to learn to love yourself
Julie through the glass
I'm looking forward to
Doing things with you
You could have held me again
You said your songs had all gone
And that the road back up was too long
I loved you all along
The part of me that died
Was ready to be reborn
And you called of the hounds
Of hell with your songs
You could have held me again
Somewhere along the road
Out of despair and believing
You gave up on my love
I loved you all along
The wind is coming up strong and fast
And the moon is smiling on me
Miles from nowhere so small at last
In between the sky and the sea
I'm bound for the island
I think I can make it before dawn
It's night on the ocean
And it feels like I've never
Seagulls cry and the hills are green
And my friends are waiting for me
I'm bound for the ocean
I think I can make it by dawn
It's night on the ocean
And it feels like I've never
Oh it feels like I've never
It's all of our birthdays this summer
We've given up caffeine and sworn off desserts
Stay in perfect shape and be number one
We've got brilliant excuses for having no fun
Make love in the microwave
Think of all the time you'll save
And don't forget to make it look
As though you're working very very hard
But I'll be your lover if you will be mine
We'll go back to the garden and have a good time
And just blow out the candles
Till the sun dries up the sea
Until then I'll always be
I'll be yours till endless time
I'll adore your charms sublime
Guess by now you know that I'm
I'll never give you reason to cry
I'd be unhappy if you were blue
Through the years our love will grow
Like a river it will flow
It can't die because I'm so
I'll never give you reason to cry
I'd be unhappy if you were blue
Like a river it will flow
It can't die because I'm so
There are ghosts who would warn me
To feel something so worthy
For someone like you...
But if it feels all right
If it feels all right and it feels all right
Do the walls come down
Do your eyes grow dim
Do the walls come down
Nothing like a rainy night
Nothing like a vivid dream
To take you back again
Do your eyes grow dim
Do the walls come down
Something in my pocket
That was written years ago
Is it easier for you to say
You never loved me anyway
Or do you hide me in your attic trunk
But come you back when summer's in the meadow
Or all the valley's hushed and white with snow
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or all the valley's hushed and white with snow
Then if you bend and tell me that you love me
One of these mornings
In the drizzling rain
I'd of stayed at home
One of these mornings
I've lived in all of the houses he's built
We're so close we can dispense with houses
We don't need a home at all
It's come to be a habit with me to dine alone
And the evenings end so early
There's no distance at all.
Turn on the headlights
You haven't listened at all.
I'm stuck with acting out a part.
We don't need words at all.
There's a husky voice
That speaks to me in the dark
And on the phone from studios
Through tunnels of long distance.
We're so close we can dispense with love
With each passing day
And I know I'll change
But when our world turns
Where it's turning to
You'll see some hearts fade
I will still be there
Someone waits for you
Who'll wait until you do
In some familiar door
And when you reach the shore
It won't hurt any more
But blue skies wait for you
There's someone smiling through
Someone waits for you
There's someone smiling through
You were born to break
You were born to break
You were born to break my heart
The same reaction to the same lies
A most auspicious start
You were born to break my heart
Born to break my heart...
You don't begin to understand
I guess it's time we part
No wonder we looked like the perfect couple
It was brilliantly conceived
It seems I have a yen to lose
And you can't pass up the perfect
Just as stubborn as a fool
You'd think I might get smart
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you
The one you run to see
I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You'll hear me say that I'm
I know I'm not what you wanted
Not what you had in mind
And I didn't come close
To the mark You'd set
For the girl you'd planned to find
You've never seen me cry
We shared but idle words
And what shall we do with the child
Reminding me that we fell in love
But just for a little while
You never asked about the girl you never knew
And while she was sleeping in my arms
She never asked about you
Without you seems the only way
But time has passed and now
She'll soon be asking questions
And she'll ask about you
Shall I say to the child
Reminding me that we fell in love
But just for a little while
What shall we do with the child
How glad the many millions
Of Toms and Dicks and Williams
But you had such persistence
You wore down my resistance
You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I will never never know
It's not that you're attractive
But oh my heart grew active
When you came into view
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion
For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
He may not always say
What you would have him say
But now and then he'll say something wonderful
The thoughtless things he'll do
Will hurt and worry you
Then all at once he'll do something wonderful
He has a thousand dreams that won't come true
You know that he believes in them
And that's enough for you
You'll always go along with
Defend him when he's wrong
And tell him when he's strong
He'll always need your love
And so you'll get you're love
A man who needs your love
I love lilacs and avocados
Ukuleles and fireworks
And Woody Allen and walking in the snow
But you've got to know
You're the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
From the moment I first saw you
The second that you were born
I knew that you were the love of my life
Quite simply the love of my life
I love Lucy and pumpernickel bread
The Statue of Liberty and standing ovations
But get it through your head
You're the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
From the moment I first saw you
The second that you were born
I knew that you were the love of my life
Quite simply the love of my life
You can drive me crazy
You can drive me anywhere
Just do as you please
It may not always be easy
But you're the love of my life
My heart is riding on a runaway train
You are the love of my life
Through all the pleasure and pain
From the moment I first saw you
I knew that you were the love of my life
Simply the love of my life
I get along without you very well
Except when the soft rains fall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms
But I get along without you very well
I've forgotten you just like I should
Except to hear your name
Or someone's laugh that is just the same
But I've forgotten you just like I should
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon
Should I fall once more
No it's best that I stick to my tune
I get along without you very well
Except perhaps in Spring
But I should never think of Spring
I'll go my way by myself
This is the end of romance
I'll go my way by myself
I'll face the unknown
I'll build a world of my own
No one knows better than I myself
I see your face before me
Clouding my every dream
There is your face before me
You are my only theme
It doesn't matter where you are
I can see how fair you are
I close my eyes and there you are
If you could share the magic
If you could see me too
There would be nothing tragic
In all my dreams of you
Would that my love could haunt you so
Knowing I want you so
The moon will cast on you the shadow of my kiss
No matter where you are with whom you are
Why the gods above me who must be in the know
When you're near there's such an air of Spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer but how strange the change from major to
Why the gods above me who must be in the know
And when you're near there's such an air of Spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer but how strange the change from major to
Outside the barracks by the corner light
Darling I remember how I'd wait for you at night
And wind it through your golden hair
I'll always keep you in my heart
Last night when we were young
To think that spring had depended
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak
So now lets reminisce and recollect the size of the kisses
So now lets reminisce and recollect the size of the kisses
Spring will be a little late this year
For you have left me and where is our April love old
Yes you have left me and winter continues cold
As if to say that spring will be a little slow to start
A little slow reviving that music it made in my heart
It's merely that spring will be a little late this year
Yes time heals all things so I needn't cling to this fear
Last car on the train.
Wipe the tears from my eyes.
Like a movie in my brain.
And the score comes in and under.
Rattling down the railroad track.
But I stayed on my guard.
I always played my hand
Like I didn't have the cards.
So I could never see.
And the waves come in like thunder.
And I made a fatal blunder.
Down that railroad track.
And then the memory of the dream
Laura is the face in the misty night
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer's night
That you might never quite recall
And you see Laura on a train that is passing through
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream
She gave your very first kiss to you
But she's only a dream
Yes she gave your very first kiss to you
Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
And then would come a time when I would need you
And once again these words I'd have to say
But right or wrong I can't get along without you
You hurt me time and time again
But I still love you babe
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
Too much in love to say goodnight
Two sleepy people with nothing to say
But too much in love to break away
Your father didn't like me at all
Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall
Here we are just about the same
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
I left a note on his dresser
And my old wedding ring
With these few goodbye words
Goodbye old sleepy head
I'm packing you in like I said
Take care of everything
I'm leaving my wedding ring
Somewhere in the night chasing shadows around the bend
Somewhere in the night chasing rainbows that have no end
But dreams have a way of calling it a day
Somewhere in the night till I find you
In the misty light you are mine and you hold me fast
But dreams have a way of calling it a day
Secrets lights up the sky
There's nothing but a silky hope
We're just about there
We're just one little breath away
We're just one surrender away
You're coming down with something
Don't you feel like you're
And it doesn't get sicker than you
Don't you feel like this is the really good part
Where it's still up in the air
The perfect romance is never
And don't stop saying your prayers
We're just one little heartbeat away
There's a light in my window
And a little red ladybug in my hair
Just one turn down an empty street
Of which I am pleasantly aware
One must be right for me.
One must be right for me.
That big dumb guy is here at last
Big papa bear Maybe you can remember It wasn't that long ago When you dialed a number
Don't want nothing to do
But just study the skin on your face I want to look up at the sky And watch the sunset With someone like you
That big dumb guy is here at last
That big dumb guy is here at last
In fact he's brought his
Big raccoon coat with him
And he doesn't even know it's
Politically incorrect
That big dumb guy is here at last
Let's get it on with your big bad self
That big dumb guy is here at last
I don't want to have to go into those chat rooms anymore
I don't want to see that pinwheel go round
And around and around
Every time I try to open any window
Purple surprises riding in on a nerve
Begins to excite you before it settles down
It's after the knives and the sutures and needles
I'm left with an arrow that points at my heart
I call it the seat of my sentimental sorrow
Gone seems to be one of the sum of my parts
And the night is cold
As the coldest nights are
She comes from an evening star
You won't have to look far
Lead with your spirit and follow
A man I knew once said he wanted to see me
I said I'd been sick but was on the mend
I told him a few of the overall details
And he's never called me again
What a gift in disguise that poor little puppy
So scared of misfortune and always on guard
A big man will love you
Loves a really good scar
Cause the dawn breaks
And it's breaking your heart
She sits at the end of the bar
You won't have to look far
Lead with your spirit and follow
The world has tilted but
The world has expanded
And the world has turned
Cause the night is warm and all full of stars
She's moved right into my heart
You won't have to look far
Lead with your spirit and follow
Run with the red deer
And sing with the wind
And meaning will follow
The scar is God given
As a sign for your life
Strength from your ancestors
And through your own mouth
Like a tree on the wind
Grow louder in our ears Louder in our ears every night
When I was broke I got used to doormen and limousines
At a charity ball and a White House sup I've perfected my smile for the camera Chin is up I miss you all so much If only I could cross the river But something me holding us back
A way of life that's too familiar Like the lines are to the railroad Lines are to the railroad
If only we could cross the river
The whispers across the Hudson
Grow louder in our ears
If only we could cross the river
But something is holding us back
A way of life that's too familiar
Like the lines are to the railroad
Lines are to the railroad
All my doctors and friends
Have concocted these theories
Weary of seeing me day after day
On the edge of my bed
And it's been this way for quite a while
I'd like to rely on my old game and yet
Couldn't get up today
Any excuse but the truth will do
I don't lie very well
No I'm not a deceiver
But I can't bring myself to admit that I'm blue
And it's been this way
I'd like to rely on my old game and yet
The clock and the calendar
When I'm not okay at all
I forget what it all means
Don't remember if love ever really felt good
I'd put on a good show
And it's been this way for quite a while
I'd like to rely on my old game and yet
Some day I'm going to grow up And be every man's dream
Some day I'm going to grow up And forget this sad little me
I'm going to shine in the spotlight Wear sexy clothes
Be somebody everybody wants to meet And no one ever really knows
No one will ever know me I'm an actress through and through
And to my bones I'm an actress through and through
And to my bones Critics will adore me At least they will at first
But you see I already know this So it can't never really hurt
I'm an actress through and through And to my bones
I may not be that pretty now But who's the referee
Standards of beauty Will be redefined because of me
And then they'll be the scandals
Everywhere my name Men will jump from balconies
And to my bones My acceptance speech will be a milestone
Never will such a star Have ever graced the microphone
And of course I'll thank my agent The way they always do
Though I could have done it without him And that goes for the Academy too
And the makeup people and the lighting designers and everybody else
And to my bones I'm an actress through and through
I'll be gracious to the lesser stars And generous to the unknowns
And if another actress threatens My position on the throne
I don't exactly know But I know that it could turn into
One of my most poignant roles
Everyone will have their handkerchiefs out
And they'll have to leave the theater early
And then they'll go home
They'll have a big glass of alcohol
And if I make it to the top I won't be overthrown
I'm really the kind to dazzle and twirl
Have tantrums like silver slanting rain
And stride like a lion up
Don't think about the fall
To cower in the corner
And pray that some guy
Will have a kind word to say
Then be tiny in his arms
And be stroked to my heart
And coaxed and caressed
And combed and undressed
Then finally I'll trust him
The pendulum swings both ways
And I lose my equilibrium
I swing so fast inside it's motion
That I become the hum
You see I'm really the kind
And criticize the mannequins
Justify spending the cash
With a naughty little laugh
I'm the belle of the ball
Are having dinner without you
We're witty and we use it to be vicious
In just another minute
We'll laughing about you
It wouldn't look suspicious
Don't really care if you have needs
Your hopes and dreams
Are trivial by your standards
We make fun of how you sing
And then we imitate your speech
And the stupid things
You say we like to slander
But we won't reel you out too far
We've bonded here in faithlessness
To undermine your happiness
Toying with your paranoia
Everything you do annoys us
You bought us all those gifts
You liked to make us think
Be careful in the future
Of everything you say and do
We your dearest friends
Of thinking you're a star
And we the least of all
It's been a long time since
You had those famous lovers
But we won't reel you out too far
To undermine your happiness
Toying with your paranoia
Everything you do annoys us
Finally you've grown a sturdy backbone
There'll be no invitation to
Your rocky coast this year
Your queenly voice will
Ice us down the telephone
You'll never guess who's joining us
Are you worried we might spill the beans
Are you worried we might tell
About your little visit to the bin when
But we won't reel you out too far
We've bonded here in faithlessness
To undermine your happiness
Toying with your paranoia
Everything you do annoys us
Toying with your paranoia
You have an unforgivable personality
We were so happy once in the Garden of
Here comes the waiter
We'll just put it on your house charge
You'll never know the difference
Like there's nothing to lose
They look forward with innocence
The future's a radiant blur
So I wonder whatever became of him
On the Upper East Side
Picture a couple so dignified
Well I wonder whatever became of him
Except the broken plates
Everything gets stolen
You don't want anyway
The things you don't want anyway
She used to slap her own thigh
Well I wonder whatever became of him
Don't step out of the photograph
Don't hurt yourselves
Is it tomorrow's twilight
You can hardly make out
So I wonder whatever became of him
How can I go on when every thought hurts I flirt with the notion of no more songs
Did you ever know you'd be heard in the middle distance
In this close and smoky room
Once blew into her room
Now all she can do is kneel and pray
She's lost in the streets
She's lost in the smiles of the baby all day
She cries when underneath the crystal moon
She hears a sultry Spanish song
But coming from that neighborhood saloon
Puts the child in the stroller
And walks through the park
Her own is so far away
My father sits at night with no lights on
His cigarette glows in the dark
The living room is still
I tiptoe past the master bedroom where
My mother reads her magazines
But I forget how to dream
But you say it's time we moved in together
They have their houses and their lawns
They have their silent noons
Their children hate them for the things they're not
They hate themselves for what they are
But you say it's time we moved in together
You say that we can keep our love alive
The couples cling and claw
And drown in love's debris
You say we'll soar like two birds through the clouds
But soon you'll cage me on your shelf
I'll never learn to be just me first
Play it again before you put your guitar down
About the good times.
Follow me wherever I will go
We can never know about the days to come
But we think about them anyway.
And I wonder if I'm really with you now
Or just chasing after some finer day
Is keeping me waiting
And I tell you how easy it feels to be with you
And how right your arms feel around me.
But I rehearsed those words just late last night
When I was thinking about how right tonight might be.
Is keeping me waiting
And tomorrow we might not be together
So I'll try and see into your eyes right now
Well I have known you
Since you were a small boy
And your mama used to say
Then you'd turn on the radio
And sing with the singer in the band
Your mama would say to you
But you're a legend in your own time
A hero in the footlights
But a legend's only a lonely boy
When he goes home alone.
And though I know you
Still have the heart of that small boy
Can ever feel that she's been really touched
Then you turn on the radio
And sing with the singer in the band
Think kind of sadly to yourself
This isn't exactly what you had planned
But you're a legend in your own time
A hero in the footlights
But a legend's only a lonely boy
When he goes home alone
Well a legend's only a lonely boy
Julie through the glass
You've just got to be
The sweetest thing I've ever seen.
Julie through the glass
And who knows where you've been
And where you're gonna go.
We want you to love the world
To know it well and play a part
And we'll help you to learn to love yourself
Julie through the glass
I'm looking forward to
Doing things with you
You walked into the party
Like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror as
You watched yourself gavotte
And all the boys dreamed that they'd be your partner
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
When I was still quite naive
When you said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
And your horse naturally won
To see the total eclipse of the sun
And when you're not you're with
Some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
You probably think this song is about you
You probably think this song is about you
We tell each other everything
About the lovers in the past
And why they didn't last
We share a cast of characters from A to Z
We know each other's fantasies
And though we know each other better when we explore
That I never knew some of those secrets of yours
The beach was empty but for one
Now you were lying in the sun
She drank a pint of your rum
And later when you told me
You said she was a bore
That I never knew some of those secrets of yours
You always answer my questions
But they don't always answer my prayers
And though I know you say that it's me that you adore
Some of those secrets of yours
Some of those secrets of yours
Some of those secrets of yours
You're with me now and as long as you stay
I know you've had some bad luck with ladies before
They drove you or you drove them crazy
But more important is I know you're the one and I'm sure
And it used to be for a while
That the river flowed right to my door
Making me just a little too free
But now the river doesn't seem to stop here anymore
Hold me in your hands like a bunch of flowers
And I know what I think I've known all along
Nothing you could ever do would turn me away from you
I love you now and I love you now
Even though you're ten thousand miles away
I'll love you tomorrow as I love you today
All those crazy nights when I cried myself to sleep
Now melodrama never makes me weep anymore
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you
How to turn down the noise in my mind
Now I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you
Suffering was the only thing that made me feel I was alive
Though that's just how much it cost to survive in this world
How to open up and drink in all that white love
Pouring down from the heaven
I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
She rides in the front seat...
She's my older sister.
She knows her power over me.
She goes to bed an hour later than I do
When she turns the lights out
She flies through the back door.
She's my older sister.
She has ice skates and legs that fit right in.
She's wicked to all the beaming dreamers who later
Boast of an evening by her fiery side.
And in her black gymnastic tights
She runs into some elastic nights
Sophisticated sister sings for the soldiers of the soccer team.
Their silver ideas and sororities
They tinker with love and their Model T's
She turns everybody's heads
While I wear her last year's threads
With patches and stitches and a turned up hem.
Some strong feeling's some old love
I saw you and it made no sense at all
Now I feel like there's too much caffeine in my blood
Like a waterfall washing me down
Like a waterfall going down
Just like a waterfall washing me down
Like a waterfall going down and down and down
You're an old lover making new contact
Making those cold defenses melt
And though lying in your arms is after the fact
Once again I'm feeling like I've never felt
It's like a waterfall going down
Like a waterfall washing me down
Like a waterfall going down
Just like a waterfall washing me down
There's a new kind of dancing
That's gonna be the rage
You just leave yourself behind
Like an actor on a stage
Shine a different attitude
Strut around the floor in a different attitude
Any attitude is the proper attitude
Don't be afraid to change your attitude
Free up your spirit with a new attitude
If you stretch or shake
And it don't really matter
What moves your body makes
And it don't really matter
What steps you choose to do
Strut around the floor in a different attitude
Learn to move in another attitude
Find the groove in a new attitude
Don't be afraid of a new attitude
It don't really matter
What steps you choose to do
Strut around the floor in a new attitude
Do the locomotion in a new attitude
Do the mashed potato in a new attitude
Capture it and freeze
A hundred and eighty degrees
Or if you're at a loss
Observe some natural dude
And turn into a mirror of his attitude
Was together about you
I was an expert a silence
I enjoyed the blonds in their red jeeps
Stopping you on the street
Knowing none could compare with me
In my airy skirts and cool retreats
In times when my head was together about you
I was an expert at silence
You could have told the truth all the time
I was that at ease inside
You never made me cry
And then one night I lied
I got down with a boy in the backwoods
I didn't tell you and you didn't see
And that's when jealousy got the dog up in me
Now every look you get
Seems like another threat
I pick your pockets almost hoping to find
Though now I just can't sit still
And though that boy meant nothing to me
Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
But somehow you found me
But like heaven above me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight
And nobody does it better
Though sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
The way that you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from running
But just keep it coming
And nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Were you looking for my reaction
What do you need to know
Don't you know I'll always be your girl
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
Thought we'd closed the book
You don't have to prove to me that you're beautiful to strangers
Till the sun dries up the sea
Until then I'll always be
I'll be yours till endless time
I'll adore your charms sublime
Guess by now you know that I'm
I'll never give you reason to cry
I'd be unhappy if you were blue
Through the years our love will grow
Like a river it will flow
It can't die because I'm so
I'll never give you reason to cry
I'd be unhappy if you were blue
Like a river it will flow
It can't die because I'm so
I'm home again in my old narrow bed
Where I grew tall and my feet hung over the end
The low beam room with the window looking out
On the soft summer garden
Where the boys grew in the trees
And no one was at fault
Frightened by the power in every innocent thought
And the silent understanding passing down
Let the boys grow in the trees
Do you go to them or do you let them come to you
Do you stand in back afraid that you'll intrude
Deny yourself and hope someone will see
And live like a flower
While the boys grew in the trees
Tonight I lie alone again and curse my own desires
Sentenced first to burn and then to freeze
And watch by the window
I can smell the passion of another man on your breath
You throw your misdemeanors right up in my face
You've taken your half out of the middle
But now I'm damned if I'll give you and itch
Sitting in a car here
After a party where we've seen
Everyone we've known for years
Well I've known you for years
Oh but now it's all changed
And all of my feelings
We can take of the phone
You can take of my clothes
Say that it feels good
Maybe too good to say that it feels like a dream
You want to knock on some wood
Well I'll give you some wood
And I'll give you some fire
And I will show you my desire
We'll have a few laughs
You can stay overnight
I'll give you some wood
Oh Mama say a prayer for me
Don't let him seize me
How can anyone know what you are to me
That I'm in heaven again
Because you've come back to me
And put on cologne and sit by the phone for you
And drink to the heart
Which has a will of its own
They think I've sunk so low
And put on cologne and I will wait by the phone for you
But you're somewhere a part of my life
And it looks like you'll stay
I keep thinking when does it end
Where's the day I'll have started forgetting
But I just go on thinking and sweating
And cursing and crying
And turning and reaching
But you're still somehow part of my life
And you won't go away
So there's hell to pay
I'll die day after day after day
After day after day after day
You know I loved you baby
In the warmth of our bed
All the things that you said were
You said our love was sacred
But you left me alone to make it
You want to come back again someday
You say you'll come back again someday
Two lovers with the best intentions to stay
Together they the decide to separate
But it happens everyday
Turn him into a robber
But I don't regret that I loved you
How I loved you I will never forget
And in time I'll look back and remember
The boy that I knew when we first met.
Still it happens everyday
Two lovers turn and twist their love into hate
But am I so different
You could have held me again
You said your songs had all gone
And that the road back up was too long
I loved you all along
The part of me that died
Was ready to be reborn
And you called of the hounds
Of hell with your songs
You could have held me again
Somewhere along the road
Out of despair and believing
You gave up on my love
I loved you all along
We were up on the roof laughing at the heat
That was the last I ever saw of you
No more rainbows over Central Park
In this house no window has a view
There's no love here without you
When you gonna come back home
When you gonna see it's been too long
When you gonna come back home to me
I'm holding my breath half expecting to see
Which way your heart's gonna go
I only pray it leads you back to me
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
So don't mind if I fall apart
You kiss the host goodbye
Then you break a window
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
So don't mind if I fall apart
And I believe in love
But what else can I do
I'm so in love with you
It's coming around again
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It will be coming around again
But it's coming around again
I have no need of half of anything
Give me all the earth and sky
Half the truth is of no use
Give me the full moon
And if I can't take the whole of you
Till the last star fades
Take it from me anyway
As long as you'll join me in that emotion
Give me the full moon
And if I can't take the whole of you
Till the last star fades
Take it from me anyway
Don't leave me guessing alone
Don't walk me half the way home
You can do that tomorrow
Give me the full moon
And if I can't take the whole of you
Till the last star fades
Take a look around now
Try a new translation
Don't look at your man in the same old way
Just because you don't see shooting stars
Doesn't mean it isn't perfect
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
It's the slow and steady fire
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
It's your heart and soul's desire
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
She's got a brand new shiny boy
And they're moving out to Malibu
To play with all his pretty toys
And you feel closed in by the same four walls
The same old conversation
With the same old guy you've know for years
But use your imagination
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
It's the slow and steady fire
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
It's your heart and soul's desire
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
What if the Prince on the horse in your fairytale
Is right here in disguise
And what if the stars you've been reaching so high for
Are shining in his eyes
Don't look at yourself in the same old way
Shoot the stars off in your own backyard
Don't look any further
What do the neighbors say
When they hear us scream at night
Do they talk about a love
What do the neighbors know
About the heart and soul
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane we got here
I don't want a man who says
All that I want is you
Make me crazy like the moon
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane that we share
I don't want a man who
Tiptoes up the stairs
All that I want is you
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane that we share
I don't want a man who
Tiptoes up the stairs
And your freight train
And your Mack truck loving
We're coming to the edge
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
Let all the dreamers wake the nation
The morning lights the streets that lead them
And sirens call them on with a song
It's asking for the taking
We're coming to the edge
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
We the great and small
And blaze a trail of desire
Through the darkening dawn
It's asking for the taking
You've never even seen
In the eyes of your lover
We're coming to the edge
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
It's asking for the taking
We're coming to the edge
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
My romance doesn't need a thing but you
Better not make her jealous of me
Better convince her there was nothing between us
I'm not those initials in your diary
But if you slip and my name comes up
Don't deny that you knew me
Just leave out the white nights
The moon in your window
The break in your whisper
Better not tell her why you love Spanish dancing
Don't bother to say that it's hot in the summer in Madrid
Like the trace of a song that you hear in the wind
But if you slip and my name comes up
Don't deny that you knew me
Just leave out the white nights
The moon in your window
The break in your whisper
Leave out the tears and the laughter
She won't need to know
That I cried when you left
That I think of you still
But if you slip and my name comes up
Don't deny that you knew me
Just leave out the white nights
The moon in your window
The break in your whisper
Leave out the tears and the laughter
She won't need to know
That I'd die for your love
I love lilacs and avocados
Ukuleles and fireworks
And Woody Allen and walking in the snow
But you've got to know
You're the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
From the moment I first saw you
The second that you were born
I knew that you were the love of my life
Quite simply the love of my life
I love Lucy and pumpernickel bread
The Statue of Liberty and standing ovations
But get it through your head
You're the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
From the moment I first saw you
The second that you were born
I knew that you were the love of my life
Quite simply the love of my life
You can drive me crazy
You can drive me anywhere
Just do as you please
It may not always be easy
But you're the love of my life
My heart is riding on a runaway train
You are the love of my life
Through all the pleasure and pain
From the moment I first saw you
I knew that you were the love of my life
Simply the love of my life
Dear mother the struggle is over now
And your house is up for sale
We divided your railway watches
Between the four of us
I fought over the pearls
But it was all a metaphor
For what was wrong with us
As the room is emptying out
Your face so young comes into view
And a pool of light you can walk into
That part of our life together is over
Are you dancing with Benjamin Franklin
Last night I swear I could feel you
Moving through my room
And I thought you touched my feet
I so wanted it to be true
In my theater there is a stage
That part of our life together is over
In the river I know I will find the key
And your voice will rise like the spray
In the moment of knowing
The tide will wash away my doubt
Making it nice for when I come home
Like the way I find my bed turned down
Coming in from a late night out.
Please keep reminding me
Of what in my soul I know is true
And two or three stars we can gaze into...
That part of our life together is over
But I will wait for you forever
A star that's always watching
A candle always burning
Imagining what their futures will be.
Imagining what their futures will be.
The younger one stands with her eyes open wide.
I didn't choose you and you didn't choose me.
When the stars grow dim and your dreams seem old.
My love will be your remedy.
I'll choose you and you'll choose me.
Last car on the train.
Wipe the tears from my eyes.
Like a movie in my brain.
And the score comes in and under.
Rattling down the railroad track.
But I stayed on my guard.
I always played my hand
Like I didn't have the cards.
So I could never see.
And the waves come in like thunder.
And I made a fatal blunder.
Down that railroad track.
Purple surprises riding in on a nerve
Begins to excite you before it settles down
It's after the knives and the sutures and needles
I'm left with an arrow that points at my heart
I call it the seat of my sentimental sorrow
Gone seems to be one of the sum of my parts
And the night is cold
As the coldest nights are
She comes from an evening star
You won't have to look far
Lead with your spirit and follow
A man I knew once said he wanted to see me
I said I'd been sick but was on the mend
I told him a few of the overall details
And he's never called me again
What a gift in disguise that poor little puppy
So scared of misfortune and always on guard
A big man will love you
Loves a really good scar
Cause the dawn breaks
And it's breaking your heart
She sits at the end of the bar
You won't have to look far
Lead with your spirit and follow
The world has tilted but
The world has expanded
And the world has turned
Cause the night is warm and all full of stars
She's moved right into my heart
You won't have to look far
Lead with your spirit and follow
Run with the red deer
And sing with the wind
And meaning will follow
The scar is God given
As a sign for your life
Strength from your ancestors
And through your own mouth
Like a tree on the wind
Some day I'm going to grow up And be every man's dream
Some day I'm going to grow up And forget this sad little me
I'm going to shine in the spotlight Wear sexy clothes
Be somebody everybody wants to meet And no one ever really knows
No one will ever know me I'm an actress through and through
And to my bones I'm an actress through and through
And to my bones Critics will adore me At least they will at first
But you see I already know this So it can't never really hurt
I'm an actress through and through And to my bones
I may not be that pretty now But who's the referee
Standards of beauty Will be redefined because of me
And then they'll be the scandals
Everywhere my name Men will jump from balconies
And to my bones My acceptance speech will be a milestone
Never will such a star Have ever graced the microphone
And of course I'll thank my agent The way they always do
Though I could have done it without him And that goes for the Academy too
And the makeup people and the lighting designers and everybody else
And to my bones I'm an actress through and through
I'll be gracious to the lesser stars And generous to the unknowns
And if another actress threatens My position on the throne
I don't exactly know But I know that it could turn into
One of my most poignant roles
Everyone will have their handkerchiefs out
And they'll have to leave the theater early
And then they'll go home
They'll have a big glass of alcohol
And if I make it to the top I won't be overthrown
If you want to be brave
And reach for the top of the sky
And the farthest point on the horizon
Do you know who you'll meet there
They need to be in danger of burning by fire
One who is touched by the sun
The safe side of the street
And lull myself to sleep
But deep down inside I know
Let my wings of desire
I need to let them say
One who is touched by the sun
Christmas Is Almost Here
There's a hand that's old and rough
To one that's new and small
Whose life has just begun
Calm each others fears
Christmas is almost here
There's a rocky road ahead
Two people walk alone
Wondering in the fading light
If they can find their home
When hope is almost gone
A distant light appears
Christmas is almost here
Almost here for those in doubt
For those who must remain
Left behind when love goes cold
And shifting life makes change
Almost here for dreamers
Who think that there's a chance
That they will find their music
And a partner for the dance
There's a dream that doesn't die
Justice has a gentle hand
And love is like the sun
The darkest night is past
And by the stars we steer
Christmas is almost here
Sing all that hear in heaven God's holy word.
Take me into your hands
Make me into your prayer
Take me away to the land of Christmas
You see I need a way to pass
Breathe it and bear it and rise up again
Take me away to the land of Christmas
Where I can receive your kiss
Feel the strength in my heart
And sail through the storm
Take me away to the land of Christmas
Where I won't question your love at all
And when I kneel to you
It doesn't mean I'll get the message right
Take me away to the land of Christmas
Where I can't resist surrendering
And I'll wail like a baby
And sail through the storm
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Twelve gates to the city
There are three gates in the east
And three to the west
There's three to the north
And three to the south
There's twelve gates to the city
Twelve gates to the city
Step right up welcome to the city
Walk right through those gates to the city
There are twelve gates to the city Hallelujah
Twelve gates to the city
Twelve gates to the city
Must be the children that Moses led
There's twelve gates to the city
Twelve gates to the city
Rich and the poor welcome to the city
Young and the old welcome to the city
Weak and the strong welcome to the city
There's twelve gates to the city
Twelve gates to the city
I'll be home for Christmas
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree
Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
But only in my dreams
I won't have to wait in the driveway
I'll be welcome back inside
To put on their pretty things
But do not give away my surprise
Destiny has it's reasons
And sometimes the ride is free
I'll be home for Christmas
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
In Bethlehem and Israel
This blessed babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
Which his Mother Mary did nothing take in scorn
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
I can almost touch the stars
On their way around the world
They stop their flight
I can see the brightest star
Three wise men follow
With no time for rest
And heaven can't be far
Born the king of angels
On this Christmas morn
And heaven can't be far
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you
There he sits all alone on the sidewalk
Hoping that you won't pass him by
In the distance the ringing of laughter
And in the midst of the laughter he cries
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you
Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away
Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us will be near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
Hanging a shining star upon the highest bough
And what have you done
And a new one just begun
The near and the dear one
The old and the young
Let's hope it's a good one
For weak and for strong
For rich and the poor ones
For black and for white
For yellow and the red ones
Let's stop all the fight
Let's hope it's a good one
And what have you done
And a new one just begun
The near and the dear one
The old and the young
Let's hope it's a good one
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
Let me be before the world
What I am when I'm alone
And when my vision falls below
Let there be forgiveness
Let me answer when I'm called
Let me know the voice is right
And when it's deep inside my soul
I'll know it by it's light
And when it's deep inside my soul
I'll know it by it's light
Help me to make the loving choice
Let me answer when I'm called
By the mighty and the small
In the service of my soul
Let there always be forgiveness
Willy nilly silly old bear
It's not as if I want to rule the world
I suppose I could be happy
If I could be helpful
With just a little bit of noticing me
Figure out ways to help
Some of those in need
Indeed I could volunteer
As the friend that you would want right near
More like Rabbit and Pooh and Eeyore
I'd be useful and helpful
The one you would call
Can I walk around my shadow
Once before it disappears into the sun
Run circles around the bees
Catch the pollen before the sneeze
I'd be needed and useful
More each passing day
It's a mother's intuition to make a little space
It's her quiet mission to tidy up her place
A mother's intuition is like a kangaroo's
A mother with her intuition
Will know just what to do
It's a mother's intuition to wash her baby
And the extra soap suds on the tail
A mother with her intuition
Will know just what to do
She rubs and scrubs and scours the secrets
Until the answer clicks
Then she takes a brush and polishes your teeth
She'll make you shine and sparkle new
Until she finds the real you underneath
Sparkling just like new
It's a mother's intuition
Sing ho for the life of a bear
Sing ho for the expedition
Sing ho for the life of a bear
Sing ho for the expedition
There's a tiny little breeze
There's a buzz among the bees
Sing ho for the life of a bear
Sing ho for the expedition
Sing ho for the life of a bear
Sing ho for the expedition
To fine the North Pole
Finding the Pole may be the goal
Sing ho for the life of a bear
Sing ho for the expedition
Sing ho for the life of a bear
Sing ho for the expedition
Sing ho for the life of a bear
Sing ho for the expedition
Sing ho for the life of a bear
With a few good friends
A house is built at a corner called Pooh
With a friend and a stick
A house is built where it wasn't before
For the coat of Eeyore
With a few good friends
A house is built at a corner called Pooh
With a friend and a stick
A house is built where it wasn't before
With a few good friends
A house is built at a corner called Pooh
With a friend and a stick
A house is built where it wasn't before
With a few good friends
The more I look inside
The more he isn't there
When Piglet is not everywhere
The more I wrack my brain
The more I search in vain
I guess I'll have a little snack
And wait for it to start to rain
Maybe I will draw a picture
And while I'm busy doing that
My mind will wander off somewhere
My mind will wander off somewhere
And Piglet will be right here
The more I look inside
The more you're real to me
When the heart of the hundred acre wood is beating
And time is passing through
There's a shadow looking like a rainbows halo
And there I'm resembling you
More than power or might
Sweeter than the treats of a honey bee
I'll be here through the night
It's comforting to know
It's comforting to know
Silent as the moon at dawn
Soothing as a bed filled with hay
Strong as a hero in the land of old
I'll be here through the day
It's comforting to know
It's comforting to know
Sadder than being sorry for me
Finer than finding my tail again
I'll be here for all of thee
It's comforting to know
It's comforting to know
You only get a few good friends in this life
Who are devoted and true
And right here in this now and near
It's clear that it's all of you
I'll find you when you're hard to see
I'll look for you everywhere
You'll know just how I'm feeling when
I show you that I care
It's comforting to know
Willy nilly silly old bear
It's not as if I want to rule the world
I suppose I could be happy

How cold my toes are growing
The more I look inside
The more he isn't there
When Piglet is not everywhere
The more I wrack my brain
The more I search in vain
I guess I'll have a little snack
And wait for it to start to rain

My father sits at night with no lights on
His cigarette glows in the dark
The living room is still
I tiptoe past the master bedroom where
My mother reads her magazines
But I forget how to dream
But you say it's time we moved in together
They have their houses and their lawns
They have their silent noons
Their children hate them for the things they're not
They hate themselves for what they are
But you say it's time we moved in together
You say that we can keep our love alive
The couples cling and claw
And drown in love's debris
You say we'll soar like two birds through the clouds
But soon you'll cage me on your shelf
I'll never learn to be just me first
Well I have known you
Since you were a small boy
And your mama used to say
Then you'd turn on the radio
And sing with the singer in the band
Your mama would say to you
But you're a legend in your own time
A hero in the footlights
But a legend's only a lonely boy
When he goes home alone.
And though I know you
Still have the heart of that small boy
Can ever feel that she's been really touched
Then you turn on the radio
And sing with the singer in the band
Think kind of sadly to yourself
This isn't exactly what you had planned
But you're a legend in your own time
A hero in the footlights
But a legend's only a lonely boy
When he goes home alone
Well a legend's only a lonely boy
We can never know about the days to come
But we think about them anyway.
And I wonder if I'm really with you now
Or just chasing after some finer day
Is keeping me waiting
And I tell you how easy it feels to be with you
And how right your arms feel around me.
But I rehearsed those words just late last night
When I was thinking about how right tonight might be.
Is keeping me waiting
And tomorrow we might not be together
So I'll try and see into your eyes right now
You're with me now and as long as you stay
I know you've had some bad luck with ladies before
They drove you or you drove them crazy
But more important is I know you're the one and I'm sure
And it used to be for a while
That the river flowed right to my door
Making me just a little too free
But now the river doesn't seem to stop here anymore
Hold me in your hands like a bunch of flowers
And I know what I think I've known all along
Nothing you could ever do would turn me away from you
I love you now and I love you now
Even though you're ten thousand miles away
I'll love you tomorrow as I love you today
You walked into the party
Like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror as
You watched yourself gavotte
And all the boys dreamed that they'd be your partner
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
When I was still quite naive
When you said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
And your horse naturally won
To see the total eclipse of the sun
And when you're not you're with
Some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
You probably think this song is about you
You probably think this song is about you
All those crazy nights when I cried myself to sleep
Now melodrama never makes me weep anymore
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you
How to turn down the noise in my mind
Now I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you
Suffering was the only thing that made me feel I was alive
Though that's just how much it cost to survive in this world
How to open up and drink in all that white love
Pouring down from the heaven
I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
But somehow you found me
But like heaven above me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight
And nobody does it better
Though sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
The way that you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from running
But just keep it coming
And nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Were you looking for my reaction
What do you need to know
Don't you know I'll always be your girl
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
Thought we'd closed the book
You don't have to prove to me that you're beautiful to strangers
Oh Mama say a prayer for me
Don't let him seize me
How can anyone know what you are to me
That I'm in heaven again
Because you've come back to me
And put on cologne and sit by the phone for you
And drink to the heart
Which has a will of its own
They think I've sunk so low
And put on cologne and I will wait by the phone for you
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
So don't mind if I fall apart
You kiss the host goodbye
Then you break a window
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
So don't mind if I fall apart
And I believe in love
But what else can I do
I'm so in love with you
It's coming around again
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It will be coming around again
But it's coming around again
I have no need of half of anything
Give me all the earth and sky
Half the truth is of no use
Give me the full moon
And if I can't take the whole of you
Till the last star fades
Take it from me anyway
As long as you'll join me in that emotion
Give me the full moon
And if I can't take the whole of you
Till the last star fades
Take it from me anyway
Don't leave me guessing alone
Don't walk me half the way home
You can do that tomorrow
Give me the full moon
And if I can't take the whole of you
Till the last star fades
Take a look around now
Try a new translation
Don't look at your man in the same old way
Just because you don't see shooting stars
Doesn't mean it isn't perfect
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
It's the slow and steady fire
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
It's your heart and soul's desire
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
She's got a brand new shiny boy
And they're moving out to Malibu
To play with all his pretty toys
And you feel closed in by the same four walls
The same old conversation
With the same old guy you've know for years
But use your imagination
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
It's the slow and steady fire
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
It's your heart and soul's desire
It's the stuff that dreams are made of
What if the Prince on the horse in your fairytale
Is right here in disguise
And what if the stars you've been reaching so high for
Are shining in his eyes
Don't look at yourself in the same old way
Shoot the stars off in your own backyard
Don't look any further
What do the neighbors say
When they hear us scream at night
Do they talk about a love
What do the neighbors know
About the heart and soul
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane we got here
I don't want a man who says
All that I want is you
Make me crazy like the moon
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane that we share
I don't want a man who
Tiptoes up the stairs
All that I want is you
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane that we share
I don't want a man who
Tiptoes up the stairs
And your freight train
And your Mack truck loving
We're coming to the edge
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
Let all the dreamers wake the nation
The morning lights the streets that lead them
And sirens call them on with a song
It's asking for the taking
We're coming to the edge
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
We the great and small
And blaze a trail of desire
Through the darkening dawn
It's asking for the taking
You've never even seen
In the eyes of your lover
We're coming to the edge
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
It's asking for the taking
We're coming to the edge
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
Better not make her jealous of me
Better convince her there was nothing between us
I'm not those initials in your diary
But if you slip and my name comes up
Don't deny that you knew me
Just leave out the white nights
The moon in your window
The break in your whisper
Better not tell her why you love Spanish dancing
Don't bother to say that it's hot in the summer in Madrid
Like the trace of a song that you hear in the wind
But if you slip and my name comes up
Don't deny that you knew me
Just leave out the white nights
The moon in your window
The break in your whisper
Leave out the tears and the laughter
She won't need to know
That I cried when you left
That I think of you still
But if you slip and my name comes up
Don't deny that you knew me
Just leave out the white nights
The moon in your window
The break in your whisper
Leave out the tears and the laughter
She won't need to know
That I'd die for your love
I love lilacs and avocados
Ukuleles and fireworks
And Woody Allen and walking in the snow
But you've got to know
You're the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
From the moment I first saw you
The second that you were born
I knew that you were the love of my life
Quite simply the love of my life
I love Lucy and pumpernickel bread
The Statue of Liberty and standing ovations
But get it through your head
You're the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
From the moment I first saw you
The second that you were born
I knew that you were the love of my life
Quite simply the love of my life
You can drive me crazy
You can drive me anywhere
Just do as you please
It may not always be easy
But you're the love of my life
My heart is riding on a runaway train
You are the love of my life
Through all the pleasure and pain
From the moment I first saw you
I knew that you were the love of my life
Simply the love of my life
Dear mother the struggle is over now
And your house is up for sale
We divided your railway watches
Between the four of us
I fought over the pearls
But it was all a metaphor
For what was wrong with us
As the room is emptying out
Your face so young comes into view
And a pool of light you can walk into
That part of our life together is over
Are you dancing with Benjamin Franklin
Last night I swear I could feel you
Moving through my room
And I thought you touched my feet
I so wanted it to be true
In my theater there is a stage
That part of our life together is over
In the river I know I will find the key
And your voice will rise like the spray
In the moment of knowing
The tide will wash away my doubt
Making it nice for when I come home
Like the way I find my bed turned down
Coming in from a late night out.
Please keep reminding me
Of what in my soul I know is true
And two or three stars we can gaze into...
That part of our life together is over
But I will wait for you forever
A star that's always watching
A candle always burning
If you want to be brave
And reach for the top of the sky
And the farthest point on the horizon
Do you know who you'll meet there
They need to be in danger of burning by fire
One who is touched by the sun
The safe side of the street
And lull myself to sleep
But deep down inside I know
Let my wings of desire
I need to let them say
One who is touched by the sun
We were so strong then
We built our house on our love
We had a heart on the hill
Love was so proud then
We lived in the clouds when
The tower was crumbling down
Around us on the hill
Clean out another house
Amity is not too much to ask
We reach to the sky still
In hopes we'd be able
To see the bigger picture later on
As the valley swallowed up
All the dreams we had made
On some farther shore
We were so strong then
We built our house on our love
We had a heart on the hill
Love was so proud then
We lived in the clouds when
The tower was crumbling down
And the song that I sing is of moonlight
For the touch of your hand in the June night
The roses are sighing
And tonight how their light sets me dreaming
I bring you and sing you
Let us stray till break of day
In love's valley of dreams
I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
You're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I tried so not to give in
I said to myself this affair
Never will go so well
So why should I try to resist
When baby I know so well
That I've got you under my skin
I'd sacrifice anything
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice
That comes in the night
And repeats and repeats in my ear
Don't you know little fool
But each time that I do
Just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
I'd sacrifice anything
For the sake of having you near
In spite of the warning voice
That comes in the night
Don't you know little fool
Why not use your mentality
Well each time that I do
Just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you
I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
I only have eyes for you
Only have eyes for you
Only have eyes for you
As long as we're together
And what is there to fear
Our love is as deep as the sea
Our love is as great as a love can be
If we're alone together
Our love is as deep as the sea
Our love is as great as a love can be
If we're alone together
As long as you're close to me
Our love is as deep as a love can be
As long as you're close to me
Our love is as great as a love can be
In the still of the night
As I gaze from my window
At the moon in its flight
My thoughts all stray to you
In the still of the night
While the world is in slumber
Are you my life to be
Or will this dream of mine
Like the moon growing dim
On the rim of the hill
Are you my life to be
Or will this dream of mine
Like the moon growing dim
That led me straight to you
I still hear you saying
And I start to praying
We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seem to come from everywhere
We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seem to come from everywhere
Sometimes you think you lived before
All that you lived today
Things you do come back to you
As if they knew the way
It seems we stood and talked
We looked at each other
But I can't remember where or when
The clothes you're wearing
Are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling
You were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when
Some things that happen
Seem to be happening again
And so it seems that we have met before
But who knows where or when
Some things that happen
Seem to be happening again
And so it seems that we have met before
But who knows where or when
I become more mad about you
More lost without you
I know the only one for me
My arms won't free you
And my heart won't try
Each time I look at you
Is like the first time
Each time you're near me
And there is nothing thing I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you
I become more mad about you
More lost without you
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for can only be you
My arms won't free you
And my heart won't try
Each time I look at you
Is like the first time
Each time you're near me
The very thought of you makes my heart sing
On the wings of spring
And you appear in all your splendor
The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
While you're in my arms
I feel your lips so warm and tender
The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
And the blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own
You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
And the blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own
You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
Time and again I've longed for adventure
Something to make my heart beat the faster
Finding your love I've found my adventure
My heart beats the faster
All that I want in all of this world is you
You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are
Some day my happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are
Some day my happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are
All the things you are
I could cry salty tears
There were chills up my spine
Finding another world
What a dunce I was before
What a break for heaven's sake
Don't wake me up if I'm asleep
Let me dream that it's true
What a break for heaven's sake
The night is like a lovely tune
How white the ever constant moon
There's a line between love and fascination
That's so hard to see on an evening such as this
For they both give the very same sensation
When your lost in the magic of a kiss
Your lips are much too close to mine
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start
For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
There's a line between love and fascination
That's so hard to see on an evening such as this
For they both give the very same sensation
When your lost in the magic of a kiss
Your lips are much too close to mine
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start
For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And the temperature's really dropping
The lights are turned way down low
When we finally kiss goodnight
You'll have to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home you'll be warm
But as long as you love me so
Now when we finally kiss goodnight
You'll have to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home you'll be warm
But as long as you love me so
As long as you love me so
I built my house from barley rice
Green pepper walls and water ice
And everything emptying into white
If one should drop by
And everything emptying into white
And everything emptying into white
A blue eyed drummer rehearses outside
A black spider dancing on top of his eye
Red legged chicken stands ready to strike
And killed five hundred Nigger
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Well the sun is surely sinking down
But the moon is slowly rising
So this old world must still be spinning around
I don't know no love songs
And I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song
And you can sing this song
It won't be long before another day
We gonna have a good time
And no one's gonna take that time away
You can stay as long as you like
I don't know no love songs
And I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song
And you can sing this song
Won't somebody tell me
Won't you let me know
I'm sleepy and I'm holding on
I've got nowhere to go
You know you still have friends
And they'll be waiting for you
You've been longing for
Moonlight calls and it covers you
There's nothing left but this hidden view
Cars roll by on that motorway
Others may have a lot to say
You know you still have friends
And they'll be waiting for you
You've been longing for
Some people might stay up till it's light
Down the way where the nights are gay
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top
I took a trip on a sailing ship
Won't be back for many a day
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town
Sounds of laughter everywhere
And the dancing girls swinging to and fro
I must declare that my heart is there
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico
Won't be back for many a day
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town
Down at the market you can hear
Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear
And the rum is good any time of year
Won't be back for many a day
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town
Leave a little girl in Kingston town
Please don't take my sunshine away
I dreamed I held you in my arms
Please don't take my sunshine away
I gave my love a cherry
I gave my love a chicken
I gave my love a story
I gave my love a baby
How can there be a cherry
How can there be a chicken
How can there be a story
How can there be a baby
The story of I love you
A baby when it's sleeping
Darling you can count on me
Till the sun dries up the sea
Until then I'll always be
I'll be yours till endless time
I'll adore your charms sublime
Guess by now you know that I'm
I'll never give you reason to cry
I'd be unhappy if you were blue
Through the years our love will grow
Like a river it will flow
It can't die because I'm so
Remember me to one who lives there.
She once was a true love of mine.
On the side of a hill in the deep forest green.
Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain
Sleeps unaware of the clarion call.
Then she'll be a true love of mine.
On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves.
Washes the grave with silvery tears.
A soldier cleans and polishes a gun.
Sleeps unaware of the clarion call.
Then she'll be a true love of mine.
War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions.
General order their soldiers to kill.
Somewhere over the rainbow
There's a land that I've heard of
Somewhere over the rainbow
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Some day I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Birds fly over the rainbow
If happy little bluebirds fly
I love lilacs and avocados
Ukuleles and fireworks
And Woody Allen and walking in the snow
But you've got to know
You're the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
From the moment I first saw you
The second that you were born
I knew that you were the love of my life
Quite simply the love of my life
I love Lucy and pumpernickel bread
The Statue of Liberty and standing ovations
But get it through your head
You're the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
From the moment I first saw you
The second that you were born
I knew that you were the love of my life
Quite simply the love of my life
You can drive me crazy
You can drive me anywhere
Just do as you please
It may not always be easy
But you're the love of my life
My heart is riding on a runaway train
You are the love of my life
Through all the pleasure and pain
From the moment I first saw you
I knew that you were the love of my life
Simply the love of my life
I don't remember day and night
Don't remember any fights
I don't remember what to do
I can't recall the summer breeze
Whispers through the apple trees
And I forget the songs I knew
So much life to be lived on my own
Someday I'll wake up as good as new
Then I'll remember skies of blue
Handsome boys I almost knew
I try my best but I know it's true
Once you were just a friend of a friend at the bar
I didn't see you as my type at all
But I was stranded with no ride home
You're the melody I never had to write down
You're the fantasy I forgot to forget
You're the magician who sings the sun down
Your face in silhouette
Meeting you at midnight
Motions giving moonlight meaning
I've never known this kind of love
You're the water I never dared to jump into
You're the place my body belongs
You're the radio I tune into
Plays my favorite songs
The tide is rolling sideways
Motions giving moonlight meaning
I've never known this kind of love
Meeting you at midnight
Motions giving moonlight meaning
I've never known this kind of love
Well if you ever want an endless night
Or you need a moon and stars to shine
Just hold out your heart my darling
Hold out your heart my darling
And I will give you some of mine
Did you look right through me
Well if you ever want an endless night
And you need the moon and stars to shine
Just hold out your heart my darling
Hold out your heart my darling
And I will give you all of mine
Just hold out your heart my darling
Just hold out your heart my darling
Lining up sideways around the block
Almost convincing herself that it's true
People say a lot when they want the job
People say a lot when they want the job
When you begin to see a sinister gleam
You're locked in too tight on the same team
There's a little holiday in her heart
It's like Christmas Eve just to see you trip up
She'll sit on the floor hardly hiding a grin
People say a lot when they want the job
People say a lot when they want the job
It's already too late when she's reading your mail
Calling your agent and making the deal
She'll just copy and paste it and make it last
Nothing is sacred about your past
She'll tell of the poppies in the July fest
Maybe her brother with the badge can make the arrest
People say a lot when they want the job
People say a lot when they want the job
Lining up eager around the block
Well it's a full time job to be a hypocrite
Maybe they remember that they've done it before
The lie itself becoming the seed
They line up again just to wipe you clean
They line up again just to wipe you out
Line up again around the block
A mighty force of youth for hire
Spouting ideas that geniuses would rob oh
People say a lot when they want the job. yeah
People say a lot when they want the job
People say a lot when they want the job
People say a lot when they want the job
Everyone can see that I'm an island
I've got ocean just about everywhere that I can see
And I'll be stranded unless you come to me
I would rather fall from grace completely
Than let you change my mind
And I would rather bet my life against the rising of the sun
Some who never let you down
Some who fail you every day
And it's a blatant disrespect of privacy
I would rather fall from grace completely
Than let you change my mind
And I would rather bet my life against the rising of the sun
And that's exactly the thing that's been killing me
I would rather fall from grace completely
Than let you change my mind
And I would rather bet my life against the rising of the sun
I would rather fall from grace completely
Than let you change my mind
And I would rather bet my life against the rising of the sun
I would rather fall from grace completely
Than let you change my mind
And I would rather bet my life against the rising of the sun
I love you more than the first sunset
The first star I saw I would surely bet
You're here but you're gone
You've stifled your cries
You can't expect that I'll ever forget
All the details of your mind you would tell me through the night
After we'd made love and the way was so open
Now you turn your back to me
As if we'd never spoken
But I still love you more than the first sunset
I swear I caught a shooting star the first time we met
So how could you ever
I know that I'll never
We've been dancing in your absence
We've kept the darkness light
To come back and rise up shining
Children reaching up like flowers
We made it through the night
To bless us with another morning
Behold the warmth of day
Rising near the shore
The only place I hang my hat is in my dreams
The only time I feel at home is in my dreams
The only place I'm not alone is in my dreams
The only place I recognize is in my dreams
That's the only place I know
As slow as time will let me go
Sometime I'll only dream and I'm not scared of that
An eclipse in less than half a blink
Where you love me still
That's the only place I know
As slow as time will let me go
That's the only place I know
As slow as time will let me go
As slow as time will let me go
She looks up deep into his eyes and stares
I know that when we're together our hearts fall into line
And the stars will be quiet while I sing you this song
I know that when we're together our hearts will fall in line
And our hearts will be quiet while I sing you this song
Leaves us less time in between deep nights
And she stays because there's no time to wait
And the morning stillness still leaves no time for the light
I know that when we're together our hearts will fall in line
Our hearts will be quiet while I sing you this song
They're praying on bended knees
In their beds and on the dirty streets
Lights are out on all the Christmas trees
Feels like everyone's about to freeze
Everywhere I look someone's counting on me
So many people to love
Big girls and little boys
Broken hearts and dreams destroyed now
They need me to make it better
They're using their money up
On shiny things no one will ever use
And the ones without can't buy a pair of shoes
Nothing gentle in the Daily News
Everywhere I look someone's counting on me
So many people to love
Big girls and little boys
Broken hearts and dreams destroyed now
They need me to make it better
Can't find neighbors who are mending fences
City folk wearing all their armor
Another St. Nick rings a bell on the corner
So many people to love
There are big girls and little boys
Broken hearts and dreams destroyed now
They need me to make it better
They don't care if you brush your hair
They just care that you're there
They don't mind if you stay upstairs
They just care that you're there
They don't know if you're all you've ever wanted to be
Or if life has answered your prayers
They just want you to be there
They just want you to be there
They don't mind if you're mad and yell
As long as it's not at them
It's not because of them
They don't know that you're striving to be someone
And you're not sure how you will fare
They just want you to be there
They just want you to be there
They just want you to be there
Just as long as you're somewhat right
Their trusting eyes looking up at you
Believing you're so strong
They don't know that in time they'll grow into your shoes
They'll pound the ground and they'll swear
But they'll want you to be there
They just want you to be there
They just want you to be there
And you know I know I know you know it's clear
The last samba is playing
Don't waste me it seems to be saying
For soon this crescent moon will fade
Becoming only broken shell
And half remembered tunes
Here on this sand in the midst of these stars
Swaying in thrall to the fading guitars
Lost on the beach in this trance
They're playing the last samba
And half remembered tunes
Here on this sand in the midst of these stars
Swaying in thrall to the fading guitars
Lost on the beach in this trance
They're playing the last samba
Once blew into her room
Now all she can do is kneel and pray
She's lost in the streets
She's lost in the smiles of the baby all day
She cries when underneath the crystal moon
She hears a sultry Spanish song
But coming from that neighborhood saloon
Puts the child in the stroller
And walks through the park
Her own is so far away
Too soon to let you go
Too soon to rest my case
Too soon to start another journey
When we've just won the race
Not while the lanterns and chandeliers
Sway in the pale moonlight
Not while the shimmer of far and near
Holds us both so tight
Too soon the tide will rise
But not till it reaches another shore
Not while the music and fireworks
Sing down the hill to the sound
Not while the girls in their summer gowns
Are dancing round and round
Too soon to see the world beyond
I'm willing to be late
Let's stay right here beneath the stars
You're with me now and as long as you stay
I know you've had some bad luck with ladies before
They drove you or you drove them crazy
But more important is I know you're the one and I'm sure
And it used to be for a while
That the river flowed right to my door
Making me just a little too free
But now the river doesn't seem to stop here anymore
Hold me in your hands like a bunch of flowers
And I know what I think I've known all along
Nothing you could ever do would turn me away from you
I love you now and I love you now
Even though you're ten thousand miles away
I'll love you tomorrow as I love you today
Two lovers with the best intentions to stay
Together they the decide to separate
But it happens everyday
Turn him into a robber
But I don't regret that I loved you
How I loved you I will never forget
And in time I'll look back and remember
The boy that I knew when we first met.
Still it happens everyday
Two lovers turn and twist their love into hate
But am I so different
The wind is coming up strong and fast
And the moon is smiling on me
Miles from nowhere so small at last
In between the sky and the sea
I'm bound for the island
I think I can make it before dawn
It's night on the ocean
And it feels like I've never
Seagulls cry and the hills are green
And my friends are waiting for me
I'm bound for the ocean
I think I can make it by dawn
It's night on the ocean
And it feels like I've never
Oh it feels like I've never
I'm home again in my old narrow bed
Where I grew tall and my feet hung over the end
The low beam room with the window looking out
On the soft summer garden
Where the boys grew in the trees
And no one was at fault
Frightened by the power in every innocent thought
And the silent understanding passing down
Let the boys grow in the trees
Do you go to them or do you let them come to you
Do you stand in back afraid that you'll intrude
Deny yourself and hope someone will see
And live like a flower
While the boys grew in the trees
Tonight I lie alone again and curse my own desires
Sentenced first to burn and then to freeze
And watch by the window
We're coming to the edge
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
Let all the dreamers wake the nation
The morning lights the streets that lead them
And sirens call them on with a song
It's asking for the taking
We're coming to the edge
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
We the great and small
And blaze a trail of desire
Through the darkening dawn
It's asking for the taking
You've never even seen
In the eyes of your lover
We're coming to the edge
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
It's asking for the taking
We're coming to the edge
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
You walked into the party
Like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror as
You watched yourself gavotte
And all the boys dreamed that they'd be your partner
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
When I was still quite naive
When you said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
And your horse naturally won
To see the total eclipse of the sun
And when you're not you're with
Some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
You probably think this song is about you
I'll bet you think this song is about you
You probably think this song is about you
You probably think this song is about you
Were you looking for my reaction
What do you need to know
Don't you know I'll always be your girl
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
Thought we'd closed the book
You don't have to prove to me that you're beautiful to strangers
What's the use in spoiling a perfect day
Does a flower compromise it's beauty
Wondering if it's gonna rain
You might have the power
They give you all those special things
Just because you're world renowned
There ain't no freedom
There ain't no freedom
There ain't no freedom
There ain't no freedom
There ain't no freedom
There ain't no freedom
There ain't no freedom
There ain't no freedom
There ain't no freedom
You might be traveling
At the speed of sound
As light as a feather
What's the use in spoiling a perfect day
Does a flower compromise it's glory
Wondering if it's gonna rain
Success might scoop you up
There ain't no freedom
There ain't no freedom
There ain't no freedom
My father sits at night with no lights on
His cigarette glows in the dark
The living room is still
I tiptoe past the master bedroom where
My mother reads her magazines
But I forget how to dream
But you say it's time we moved in together
They have their houses and their lawns
They have their silent noons
Their children hate them for the things they're not
They hate themselves for what they are
But you say it's time we moved in together
You say that we can keep our love alive
The couples cling and claw
And drown in love's debris
You say we'll soar like two birds through the clouds
But soon you'll cage me on your shelf
I'll never learn to be just me first
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
So don't mind if I fall apart
You kiss the host goodbye
Then you break a window
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
So don't mind if I fall apart
And I believe in love
But what else can I do
I'm so in love with you
It's coming around again
I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It will be coming around again
But it's coming around again
We can never know about the days to come
But we think about them anyway.
And I wonder if I'm really with you now
Or just chasing after some finer day
Is keeping me waiting
And I tell you how easy it feels to be with you
And how right your arms feel around me.
But I rehearsed those words just late last night
When I was thinking about how right tonight might be.
Is keeping me waiting
And tomorrow we might not be together
So I'll try and see into your eyes right now
Most everyone I know leaves New York on holidays
Is a little lonely here
Fireworks out on the river
And the boys all drinking beer
Sing hallelujah for the year
Hallelujah for the year
Hallelujah for the year
There's a songbird in my tree
I don't know where it leads
But I believe it sings it's song for me
And never sees the things I see
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
And when the sun returns
I will have learned to sing
You'll take the notes and harmonize me
And bring me back to hallelujah
For the rest of my life
It's a mother's intuition
To make a little space
It's her quiet mission to tidy up her place
A mother's intuition is like a kangaroo's
Will know just what to do
It's a mother's intuition to wash her baby
Well she won't forget behind the ears
And the extra soap suds on the tail
A mother's into cleaning
She'll clean until she's through
To add up two and two
Will know just what to do
A mother has a feeling
She pays special attention
If someone is concealing
If someone's playing tricks
She rubs and scrubs and scours the secrets
Until the answer clicks
Then she takes a brush
And polishes your teeth
She'll make you shine and sparkle new
Until she finds the real you
Sparkling just like new
It's a mother's intuition
It's a mother's intuition
I'm waking you for the storm
A day before the day after
In a white sandy beach that we love
Everyone else is gone
I've taken all th pain from you
Everyone else is someone new
The memories are not important
Nothing matters except me and you
A couple dogs and a few good friends
And its three in the morn
I'm waking you before the storm
You'll be okay with me
Safely you will sleep
And your voice will speak
Named after my mother
My old man is another
Child that's grown old
If dreams were thunder
This old house would've burned down
That flies from Montgomery
Just give me one thing
Is just a hard way to go
When I was a young girl
He weren't much to look at
But that was a long time
And no matter how I try
Like a broken down dam
That flies from Montgomery
Just give me one thing
There are flies in the kitchen
Since I woke up today
How the hell can a person
That flies from Montgomery
Just give me one thing
Back the way it was before
Before the heart was broken
Back the way it used to be
Talks didn't end in a quarrel
Everything seemed so normal
Back the way it was before
But now the limo pulls up to the door
I forgot the groceries
Back the way it was before
The chicken pox was easy
We told each other everything
Back the way it used to be
When we were a happy family
If we wanted tiny little sandwiches
And drank the cheapest wine.
And he believed in me
Down by the serpentine.
It was the best thing
To come along for a long time.
And saw three children with smiles.
What I could make of the youngest child.
And as she blew the candles out
It was the best thing
To come along for a long time.
What do the people at the end of the world do
I'll go my way by myself
This is the end of romance
I'll go my way by myself
I'll face the unknown
I'll build a world of my own
No one knows better than I myself
I see your face before me
Clouding my every dream
There is your face before me
You are my only theme
It doesn't matter where you are
I close my eyes and there you are
If you could share the magic
If you could see me too
There would be nothing tragic
In all my dreams of you
Knowing I want you so
Don't be a stubborn man
Don't leave me in the cold
Is know what I've done wrong
All I want to know is what to do
When I can't get to you
There's too much long distance
And tonight I need you
You've opened up my heart
You led me by the hand
You took me slow so I would understand
Let nothing you dismay
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy
From God our Heavenly Father
And unto certain Shepherds
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy
This day is born a Saviour
To free all those who trust in Him
O tidings of comfort and joy
The shepherds at those tidings
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy
And when they came to Bethlehem
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy
And with true love and brotherhood
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.
The torch I carry is handsome
It's worth its heartache in ransom
And when the twilight steals
I know how the lady in the harbor feels
I'm just as blue as the sky
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
Hanging on a stream of dreams
Remind her of our crazy schemes
So I gave that treatment a try
Then one day she passed me right by
I guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
You lie awake and think about the girl
That's the time you miss her most of all.
Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird
And if that mockingbird won't sing
Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring
And if that diamond ring turns brass
Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass
And if that looking glass gets broke
Papa's gonna buy you a billy goat
And if that billy goat won't pull
Papa's gonna buy you a cart and bull
And if that cart and bull fall down
I gave my love a cherry without no stone
I gave my love a chicken without no bone
I gave my love a story without no end
How can there be a cherry without no stone
How can there be a chicken without no bone
How can there be a story without no end
A chicken when it's a pippin it hath no bone
A story when it's wending it hath no end
All those crazy nights when I cried myself to sleep
Now melodrama never makes me weep anymore
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you
How to turn down the noise in my mind
Now I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you
I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Thought that's just how much it cost to survive in this world
How to open up and drink in all that white light
Haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you
I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
Haven't got room for pain
I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
And in despair I bowed my head
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
I'll be home for Christmas
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
But only in my dreams
I won't have to wait in the driveway
I'll be welcome back inside
Please ask the kids to put on their pretty things
But do not give away my surprise
Destiny has it's reasons
And sometimes the ride is free
I'll be home for Christmas
Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
Tonight we'll put all other things aside
Get in this time and show me some affection
And if you move real slow I let it go
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
And I know I know I know I know I know I want you
We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last for long long time
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
And if you move real slow I let it go
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
It's hard to be tender
It's hard to stay open
When you're dizzy with anger
And your dreams have been broken
The country is so green in the light
Now you have gone away
I remember how you held me close
It's hard to be tender
It's hard to stay open
When the woods are on fire
And the river is frozen
Swore on my knees as a child
Never to forsake god above
Never to betray the ones who love me
Now years have come and gone
I find the strength to carry on
But the blood that ran so fast and warm
Now my heart has turned to ice
It's hard to be tender
But I'm tired of defending
I know that I love you
Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
That Baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls.
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.
That Baby can't be blessed
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.
It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
Introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world.
Then you ache just like a woman
Your sons and daughters.
And sirens call them on
It's asking for the taking.
Your sons and daughters.
We the great and small
And blaze a trail of desire
It's asking for the taking.
The sky is the color of blue
You've never even seen
In the eyes of your lover.
Your sons and daughters.
It's asking for the taking.
Your sons and daughters.
Oh but I can sing this song
Because the love's still growing
And the love's still growing
That all hope is gone
Because the love's still growing
And the love's still growing
I've got my mind on my man
I've got my man on my mind
I'm not hooked on any hero from an idle dream
But I'm idly dreaming of him
Notice he won't always let me in
Sometimes he's sleepy
And I don't think he loves me
He's a Northern baby and a Southern child
He's a gentleman lost at the fair
He has a place in my heart anywhere
Got my man on my mind
Got my mind on my man again
Got my man on my mind
I got my man on my mind
O blow ye winds over the sea.
And bring back my Bonnie to me.
I dreamed that my Bonnie was dead.
And brought back my Bonnie to me.
O Bring back my Bonnie to me.
In the morning the neighbors were dead.
A catfish he tends to groove on the water
It's just where he's bound to be
And a monkey kinds of flashes on fruits and bananas
So he lives in the top of a tree
But my eyes are made for darkness
And so the nighttime is right for me
Now most folks they like the good day time
They like to see the shining sun
They're up in the morning
Till they're too tired for having fun
But when the sun goes down
And them bright light shine
My daytime has just begun
You're just about to drive me blind
You watch and you'll see
How my love light shines
And one of them is always night
I guess you're gonna be all right
But don't come looking for string bean
Because my eyes they can't stand the light
I said sleep all day long
O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
Born the King of Angels
Born this happy morning
Now in flesh appearing
O come all ye faithful
Stuck on the corner of the afternoon
Oh just the same old tune
Autumn falling in my old chapel
I've got a mind to get the whole world shaking
Every little place I go
Tell you the story of the angels in the streets singing
There ain't no glory but the blues
And you'd lie in the rain
And all because you know you ain't got nothing to lose
I know my life may be just a song
And I'll survive when the world's overtaken
Tell you story of the angels in the streets
Singing there ain't no glory but the blues
And you'd lie in the rain
And all because you know you ain't got nothing to lose
Maybe my life is just a song
I know I'll survive when the world's overtaken
You're with me now and as long as you stay
I know you've had some bad luck with ladies before
They drove you or you drove them crazy
But more important is I know you're the one and I'm sure
And it used to be for a while
That the river flowed right to my door
Making me just a little too free
But now the river doesn't seem to stop here anymore
Hold me in your hands like a bunch of flowers
And I know what I think I've known all along
Nothing you could ever do would turn me away from you
I love you now and I love you now
Even though you're ten thousand miles away
I'll love you tomorrow as I love you today
I never will forget the way you look tonight...
The three of us in the dark
But here I am with the two of you
The three of us in the dark
I didn't hear you walk in the door
You'd called to me years ago
But here I am with the two of you
The three of us in the dark
The eerie sound of one lone fiddle
The wind is finding the tune
And you lying here in the middle
As innocent as the moon
Entangled in embraces that God will never see
Who am I talking about
It all gets so confused
And here I am with the two of you
Are having dinner without you
We're witty and we use it to be vicious
In just another minute
We'll laughing about you
It wouldn't look suspicious
Don't really care if you have needs
Your hopes and dreams
Are trivial by your standards
We make fun of how you sing
And then we imitate your speech
And the stupid things
You say we like to slander
But we won't reel you out too far
We've bonded here in faithlessness
To undermine your happiness
Toying with your paranoia
Everything you do annoys us
You bought us all those gifts
You liked to make us think
Be careful in the future
Of everything you say and do
We your dearest friends
Of thinking you're a star
And we the least of all
It's been a long time since
You had those famous lovers
But we won't reel you out too far
To undermine your happiness
Toying with your paranoia
Everything you do annoys us
Finally you've grown a sturdy backbone
There'll be no invitation to
Your rocky coast this year
Your queenly voice will
Ice us down the telephone
You'll never guess who's joining us
Are you worried we might spill the beans
Are you worried we might tell
About your little visit to the bin when
But we won't reel you out too far
We've bonded here in faithlessness
To undermine your happiness
Toying with your paranoia
Everything you do annoys us
Toying with your paranoia
You have an unforgivable personality
We were so happy once in the Garden of
Here comes the waiter
We'll just put it on your house charge
You'll never know the difference
Sailed off on a wooden shoe
Sailed down a river of crystal light
The old moon asked the three
That live in the beautiful sea
And some silver and gold have we
The old moon laughed and sang a song
As they rocked in their wooden shoe
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew
While the little stars were the herring fish
That lived in the beautiful sea
Now cast your nets wherever you wish
Never a feared are we
So sang the stars to the fishermen three
All night long their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
Bringing the fishermen home
As if it could not be
They dreamed of sailing the beautiful sea
But I shall name you the fishermen three
And Nod is a little head
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee one's trundle bed
So close your eyes while mother sings
Of the beautiful sights that be
And you will see the wonderful things
As you rock in your misty sea
Where the old moon rocked the fishermen three
Well a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Was born to Mary and Joseph the great I am
And they sang that Christmas morning
Oh a Saviour has been born
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well a long time ago when a wise man roamed the land
They saw a shiny star above the dessert sand
Well they hopped the camels that night and rode by the pale moonlight
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well it happened a long
Oh a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
And they sang that Christmas morning
Oh a Saviour has been born
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
King Herod learned a lesson
He learned it real hard
You just don't mess with the son of God
Well a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
I said a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well the demons they cried
They moaned and wailed
The kingdom got set back on it's tail
Well a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well it happened a long
Oh a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
And they sang that Christmas morning
Oh a Saviour has been born
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
All my friends been wondering
Since I took my stand for Christ
You see they're wondering just what's in store
That's when the Lord stirs up my soul
And I quite clearly say...
Testifying child of the King
And then I'll dream about witnessing.
I'm gonna walk and talk and act like Jesus
Though I may get feathered and tarred
The expressions on their faces change
You know the looks they give are priceless
Well I'm proud to be living for Jesus
I walked into the church that night
Thought that I'd drop by the side
I laughed in spite of all my blues
It's really not the type of place
I used to hang around
I looked ahead and saw a man
And watched him close as he began to speak
And it seemed like something deep inside
Had seized my soul and though I tried
It was as though the words he said
Would echo back inside my head
I'd be a fool so I suppose
Then somehow got my self composed
I felt the blood rush through my wrist
The tighter that I squeezed my fist
Determined not to let conviction start
Then with all my wisdom left behind
I somehow saw that I was blind
Let his presence fill my heart
As everyone stepped to their feet
I managed to somehow to repeat the prayer
That they were praying
Then I dropped my head and I dropped my eyes
And suddenly I realized
Just what I was saying
Through trembling lips
I envied all those wasted years
Of dreams I'd built on sand
Unloading all my guilt and wrong
I somehow felt both weak and strong
The night I took the Master's hand
As I look back remembering
How everything just seemed different than before
How every house and bird and tree
Was strangely beautiful to me
And people were even more
How could I have been so blind
To rush through life and never find
But when I whispered Jesus name
I knew I'd never be the same
The night I took the Master's hand
But when I whispered Jesus name
I knew I'd never be the same
Who sees this strength of God inside
You just say this simple prayer with me
Well I was sharing with this sales man Lyle
So he says with a million dollar smile
Well you can't find it
That horoscope that you read is just a waste
You can't find it looking at the stars
Well my best friends Ray has got this niece
That sees within my eyes this peace
And yesterday she said
Just talk with Jesus on your knees
Brother you can't find it
Or even when you pop a pill or two
You can't find it smoking dope or weed
Cause one fine day you're gonna see
That the dope that's being smoked my friend is you
Well if you're depressed
Why not try the Lord for goodness sake
Sin had left it's brand upon my life
I was only a shadow of what I could be
I truly doubted that God was alive
That's when the light of mercy was revealed to me
Then You caressed my shattered world
And healed my wounded spirit
So that I could stand
I know what life is for
My greatest efforts just to break away
Fell short of every goal
I had not anything left but to pray
And in my darkest hour
Then You caressed my shattered world
And healed my wounded spirit
So that I could stand
I know what life is for
I woke up late on my kitchen floor
From partying last night again
I had to face the day with a head of pain
I fumbled around with my TV set
To catch a flick and try to forget
I turned on this black evangelist
Who preached the word with a funky twist
His choir moved then sang and shout
I hoped in my car went to check it out
As I approached the door
There was a big soul brother around 6 foot 4
Who reached out to shake with a smile of love
And a hand as big as a boxing glove
He looked in my eyes to my soul inside
Then he said these words
Free from the power of sin.
What I saw I just nearly lost my breath
The choir swaying to and fro
While they sang about the battle of Jericho
A preacher man in a three piece with two toned shoes and a tie to boot
He said God sent his only son to say us from the evil one
If you're not born again don't stall
Come down when I give the alter call
Well I felt my feet shuffle down the aisle
While sinners marched down single file
And something drove me to my knees
With my hands held high I began to cry
And I said these words out loud
Free from the power of sin.
Because there's a price to be paid
We're constantly dying
While new foundations are laid
While we are building our faith
Sufficiently he gives his grace
I'm learning dependency
Only so I can be healed
And over and over I'm learning
To put my trust in you
Over and over I'm learning
What child like faith can do
Over and over it's easy to see
Just how you're spirit is working in me
As I grow older I'm learning over
Because I am bearing the name of Christian
I'm conscious of what people see
The only bible they may every read
Is what they will read through me
Oh use my oh God all you can
I'll go where you lead me
While holding so tightly your hand
And over and over I'm learning
To put my trust in you
Over and over I'm learning
What child like faith can do
Over and over it's easy to see
Just how you're spirit is working in me
As I grow older I'm learning over
As I grow older I'm still learning over
I'm gonna get all my friends together
Listen to what I have to say
I declare I've never felt this way
Can't hold it inside no more
The gift of eternal life is free
Washed in the blood of the Lamb
All my sins have been forgiven
And I am just now starting to live
And I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb
Well I've been washed in the blood
Washed in the blood of the Lamb
All my sins have been forgiven
And I'm on my way to heaven
I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb
Jesus died on the cross
For all the sins of fallen man
Because without the shedding of his blood
There is no remission for our sins
Don't let that evil confine you
You need to be set free
From those sins that would bind you
I've been washed in the blood
Washed in the blood of the Lamb
All my sins have been forgiven
And I am just now starting to live
Well I've been washed in the blood
Washed in the blood of the Lamb
All my sins have been forgiven
And I'm on my way to heaven
They looked so sincere with their white shirts and ties
As they tried to sell me their religion.
We talked for awhile as my eggs got cold
They said they were convinced by what they'd been taught
That God's just an exalted man like you and me.
They proceeded to tell me He's got hair
And in Daniel God's finger wrote on the wall
And His watchful eye is mentioned everywhere
The Psalms say He'll protect us with His feathers and His wings
And he proved his own divinity when he rose up from the dead
The Book of John says he's The Word of God come in the flesh
Well he's the author of salvation and he leaves no room to guess
He's the first and he's the last
So if you're still confused I've no words left to waste
I was flying out to Dallas
You come back in the form of a cow or bird or fly
You can't even go out and eat a Big Mac
And he proved his own divinity when he rose up from the dead
The Book of John says he's The Word of God come in the flesh
Well he's the author of salvation and he leaves no room to guess
He's the first and he's the last
So if you're still confused I've no words left to waste
Your spirit has raised me
And helped me to grow
Showing and teaching me things I should know
And you never gave up LORD
Your face never turned
But you strove with your servant
Lord I'm willing and I'm able to climb
That mountain before me
I so need your hand in mine
And no matter the cost Lord
And I'll learn every lesson
I'm humbled and still
For righting my wrong
Your spirit Your spirit
Will sooth all the pain
I praise you again and again
Lord without you I'm nothing
That you died on that cross
You showed me your mercy
And your love without end
It just makes me want to praise you
For righting my wrong
Your spirit Your spirit
Will sooth all the pain
I praise you again and again
For righting my wrong
Your spirit Your spirit
Will sooth all the pain
He was halfway through a meatball when the Lord spoke
And they listened intently to him
He just wants your faith and trust in Him
Little David must have just been in his teens
When he faced Goliath of the Philistines
He was armed with just a slingshot and some stones
Well Goliath was a giant and strong as a tank
And there stood little David all alone
With faith in God he slung his sling
And much to their surprise
He killed that monster with a stone
Then decapitated his fallen foe
And made sure he was dead
And showed everyone there he was someone
King David was smitten down to his socks
When his eyes caught that Bathsheba fox
His resistance was so shook that he backslid
He went and had her husband killed
The Lord punished him severe
But David's faith was strong
And God soon pulled him back in shape
Now there's a lesson to be learned here
About dealing with temptation
Call thy walls salvation
Call thy gates praised
There'll be no moon to light the nights
No sun to light the days
For God shall be thy glory
The Lord shall reign forever
In power and in might
Beginning and The End
The Word who reigns forever
His people shall be righteous
They shall posses this land
The branches of his plantings
And the works of his hands
For from a small beginning
A mighty nation grows
And in the fullness of his time
The whole wide world will know
That His name is still Yahweh
Beginning and The End
The Word who reigns forever
The demons were planning on having a party one night.
Ready to blow a fuse.
To the toes of his pointy shoes.
And I'll catch you la... la...

And not on His creation
Bless the name of Jesus
Praise the name of Jesus
Sing unto the King of Israel
Glory to His name forever
And some say He's just history.
Blessed Prince of Peace.
Some named Him devil because of His powers
To accept Him as more than just a man.
Blessed Prince of Peace.
I woke up Monday morning
I went down to McDonald's
Still asleep yet wide awake
When this loudmouth pushy businessman
But then the spirit stopped me
When I saw how it stood
The holy ghost reminded me
And it would be hard to witness to him
Stretched out on the floor
But Jesus says to crucify it
And I was fighting with temptation
I was dueling with that thing
Is all that it will bring
Put on the Mind of Christ
I thought I'd take a cruise
And catch some rays down by the ocean
I had it all planned out
To roast some burgers and some wienies
Was dressed up in bikinis
I knew that there must be a way to please the Lord and still get tan
I always hear My children when they bow to pray
I never fail to entertain all that they say
I mourn with every sorrow
I grieve with every pain
Yet all the while I'm strengthening and blessing them again
I want so much to be their Source from which they feed
For I and only I can give them what they need
That's why within the pages of My Written Word
Time and time again this simple line is often heard
In that dry and thirsty world you live in
I'll be your cup of water if only you give in
All of the things that I preferred
For those that love Me
But only if you ask of Me
In that dry and thirsty world you live in
I'll be your cup of water if only you give in
Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord
Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord
They took the palm leaves from the trees and laid
Emanuel the Chosen One has finally arrived
The way you mess me around
You accused my brethren of sins forgiven
That kicked them when they're down
You tried and you lost to be my boss
With your sickness and pain and your hell bound train
Your cheating and your lying tongue too
I want to make this very clear to you
In the name of Jesus Christ
If you're gonna try to attack
The Lord in the front and in the back
I am the resurrection and the Life
A certain man had died
In the town of Bethany
And Lazarus was his name
The Bible says he was
A man that Jesus loved
And his sisters thought
Mary and Martha longed
For Jesus healing touch
To come and raise their brother
But Jesus had a plan not known to any man
That would soon take away their pain
They was waiting for Jesus
When he died he went to where
The saints of God did stay
They lived beyond the tomb
And all the others jammed up in a room
He turned around and saw
He walked up and said hey brother
What's this group here for
Well all right this is testimony night
Have a seat man cause
The meeting is starting soon
While Mary and Martha
Moses shook his stick
Said now this meeting come to order
Abraham kicked it off
Said I want y'all know
He gave a child to my barren wife
Isaac waived his hand said
Hey daddy I knew him too
Old dignified Solomon
Adjusted his robe and said
I started to teach it
Ezekiel said I knew him
As a wheel within a wheel
Job said man he healed me
When I was almost dead
Sampson said I knew him
When some Philistines tried to jump me
I took a donkey jawbone and busted a few heads
We knew him in the fiery furnace
Jonah said man he gave me a second chance
Daniel cried out I knew him
In a hungry den of lions
The Holy Ghost hit King David
He just started to dance
Lazarus got so excited
He shouted Hey I knew him too
Moses put down his stick
Said hey who's the new kid
Needless to say the room got real quiet
When Lazarus said But I knew him
In a way you all never did
You see man I walked with him and talked with him
I saw how his teachings awed the crowds
Those famous tears of compassion I could actually see
He used to come over to my house after church
And my sisters would make him dinner
And every month I even supported his ministry
You see man I watched him confront the Pharisees
I was there when he fed the five thousand
I heard the people gasp when he healed the lame
You see man I even remember the littlest things
The things that most folks would forget
Up at the grave stone rolled away
You see it just seems like yesterday
I could hear that man saying my name
As a matter of a fact it seemed like today
Excuse me brothers I think I hear him calling me now
Like he was saying sickness be healed
Mary don't weep Martha don't moan
Maybe you held your walk on this shelf
And you've lost some ground
You've fallen again and you feel so condemned
Till it's brought you down
If your sin has dimmed the spirit's light
There's forgiveness through the blood of Christ
He'll restore your torn and shattered life
That's the reason I can say
That my spirit's at rest
Though troubles won't cease
Yet my mind is at peace
With all that is in me
That His mercy endures forever
His mercy endures forever
I am the resurrection and the Life

Someone has to walk this gospel of peace throughout our nations. Our TV game shows won't clear out our jails.
Well I walked down to my local A of G
To look around and see what I could see
I heard somebody shout spun myself about
Running straight towards me
He looked up at me and said
You may not understand
Why we shout and raise our hands
It's only because this thing is real
Frightened in the back row there I sat
I must admit I was nervous as a cat
I felt the Spirit's groove
The Holy Ghost done showed me there
You may not understand
Why we shout and raise our hands
It's only because this thing is real
Let me tell you what it feels like
It's just like fire shut up in my bones
You may not understand
Why we shout and raise our hands
It's only because this thing is real
Into the valley of the war
To face the giant who threatened God's people
Clad in the armor of the LORD
Those around him doubted any kind of victory
Even before it all began
Then the giant looked down
And laughed in David's face
The power of Death is within my command
I can bury you right where you stand
My threats have been intimidating people now for years
And a holy anger drilled him
And it shot right through the fibers of his spirit like a beam
I've got a message from the God of whom you have defied
You come against me with your weapons from Hell
You come against me with your fearful evil spell
But I come against you in the name of the God of the armies of Israel
Into the valley of our war
To face the giant who threatens God's people
Clad in the armor of the LORD
Those around us doubt any kind of victory
Even before it all began
Then our giant looks down and laughs in our face
The power of Death is within my command
I can bury you right where you stand
My threats have been intimidating people now for years
And a holy anger will drill you
And it will shoot right through the fibers of your spirit like a beam
I've got a message from the God of whom you have defied
You come against me with your weapons from Hell
You come against me with your fearful evil spell
But I come against you in the name of the God of the armies of Israel
You come against me with your weapons from Hell
You come against me with your fearful evil spell
But I come against you in the name of the God of the armies of Israel
Yet I hear the sound of the abundance of rain.
Yet I hear the sound of the abundance of rain.
We've turned from Your ways
We lack the power we once knew in our prayers
That gentle voice from heaven
We cease to hear and know
The fact that He has risen no longer stirs our soul
And cleanse us from our impurities
And revive us oh Lord
Though we've been unfaithful
We have never been disowned
The spirit that raised Christ from the dead
And cleanse us from our impurities
And cleanse us from our impurities
His witness could have been more than it had.
Somehow it's got to end.
I wanna see me some...
A little bit more conviction.
I wanna see me some...
A little bit more conviction.
A little bit more conviction.
I wanna see me some...
I know Jesus lives inside of me and answers when I pray.
The destination is there.
The destination is there.
The destination is there.
In myself I failed the Lord
Then was afraid to try once more
That fire in my soul had fled
My Spirit gives the strength you need
To raise you up and to succeed
And for vision in the night
To you I'll give these words of light
For what belongs to Me
Discouragement is all you'll find
Don't watch the waves that roll the sea
Just focus your eyes on Me
And I will make you strong and then
Your shattered courage I will mend
And if you fall and should get hurt
For what belongs to Me
Without one thing it's all in vain.
And love can help us like each other and love the only you that God has made.
Without one thing it's all in vain.
God's love can help us like each other and love the only you that God has made.
The symbol of a spirit war
A cosmic coliseum would host the end
Who will decide who forever will be the Champion.
The angels came in splendor from a star.
Tormented and vexed and grieved.
Waiting for their judgment From the Throne.
The demons reeled in pain as a swell of power like silent thunder rolled
In resplendent glory appeared the Son of God.
God the Father will oversee the duel.
And the devil leaped in fury.
With all his evil tricks he came undone.
He threw his jabs of hate and lust.
A stab of pride and envy but the hand that knew no sin blocked every one.
Now the final blow saved for the final round.
Prophetically Christ's hands came down
The blow of death felled Jesus to the ground.
The saints shocked and perplexed as wounds appeared upon His hands and feet.
And they waited for the 10 count of defeat.
The 10 count would proclaim the battle's end.
His eyes are moving...
His fingers are twitching...
Through endless ages and beyond
Let it be voiced from mountains loud and strong
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head.
And stay by His cradle till morning is nigh.
And fit us for heaven to live with Thee there.
And stay by His cradle till morning is nigh.
Keeping watch over their flock by night
And the glory of the Lord shone around them
And they were greatly afraid
For unto You is born this day
For unto You is born this day
And this shall be a sign to know
A baby wrapped in swaddling clothes
Lying in the manger lo
For unto You is born this day
For unto You is born this day
And this shall be a sign to know
A baby wrapped in swaddling clothes
He will be lying in a manger lo
For unto a child is born
Unto us a Son is given
And the government will be upon His shoulder
And His name will be called
Of the increase of his government and peace
Upon the throne of David and over his kingdom
To order it and establish it
With judgment and justice
From that time forward and even forevermore
And the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this
And this shall be a sign to know
A baby wrapped in swaddling clothes
He will be lying in a manger lo
And this shall be a sign to know
A baby wrapped in swaddling clothes
He will be lying in a manger lo
For unto You is born this day
Unto You is born this day
I feel Jesus I feel Jesus
I feel Jesus In this place
Yes my soul does Burn within me
I feel Jesus In this place
There's a peaceful breeze of heaven in the air
There's a gentle flow of music everywhere
Something whispers all is well
And assures me child fear not
There's a swell of love overtaking me
And I know it's the presence of God
I feel Jesus in the place
Yes my soul does Burn within me
Our Blessed Savior has come
The verdict delivered for salvation's plan.
The Rock of Ages will soon be made flesh.
The time that was chosen by God's perfect will
The hour appointed has now begun
Praising and magnifying His name.
The shepherds heard from the hill
With love never greater to this world He gave
His only begotten that we might be saved.
Praising and magnifying His name.
The shepherds heard from the hill
The shepherds stood gazing in fear.
Praising and magnifying His name.
Why lies He in such mean estate
The silent Word is pleading.
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
Nails and spear shall pierce Him through
Why lies He in such mean estate
Well a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Was born to Mary and Joseph the great I am
And they sang that Christmas morning
Oh a Saviour has been born
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well a long time ago when a wise man roamed the land
They saw a shiny star above the dessert sand
Well they hopped the camels that night and rode by the pale moonlight
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well it happened a long
Oh a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
And they sang that Christmas morning
Oh a Saviour has been born
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
King Herod learned a lesson
He learned it real hard
You just don't mess with the son of God
Well a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
I said a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well the demons they cried
They moaned and wailed
The kingdom got set back on it's tail
Well a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
Well it happened a long
Oh a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
And they sang that Christmas morning
Oh a Saviour has been born
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
And it happened a long time ago in a land called Bethlehem
By the hand of the Lord
That Jesus Christ is Lord of all.
Let the church arise.
Jesus Christ is Lord and God's still on the throne.
The world thinks I'm crazy.
You gotta come out from among the rest.
You gotta tell the gospel tale.
The only thing that's gonna change this world is the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Wimpy saints won't survive in spiritual warfare.
On the inside we now stand.
I believe that on the third day Jesus rose from the grave.
The world thinks we're crazy.
Our friends thinks we are crazy.
Our family thinks we're crazy.
We are the children of the King
We're not afraid to let our voices ring
Christ is our salvation
He's the light that shines
We are a chosen generation
Of the gospel or his name
Holy hands are lifted high
To the name of Jesus Christ
There's many voices in the wind
But only one that frees the soul from sin
Do you know Christ is still the answer
There is no other name so given
Unto a fallen man that he might be saved
Now we survive on the immoral lives
So they keep on with their Search for Tomorrow
There remains a blessed hope for you
With an end to marital strife
We must live for Jesus Christ
The Only Guiding Light
In the stillness of my soul
And moved inside of me.
One voice of praise to Thee.
And I thank You for the faithfulness
You've shown down through the years.
One voice of praise to Thee.
One voice of praise to Thee.
Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the
Children of Israel... None went out and none came in.
Surrounded by walls so thick the chariots raced on top.
And blazing in the sun
The armies of Israel stood waiting for commands of
And it was Joshua who led nearly three million
Israelites into the Promised Land.
Setting at our disposal weaponry that drops
Something with tremendous power that
When David played his songs of praise demons fled from Saul...
The shout of victory binds the devil with chains that
Day they marched seven.
They looked fear dead in the face.
They prepared their souls for victory...
They'd screamed their lungs out simply because
And Israel shouted in victory... and they shouted in
How many know the anointing breaks the yokes of
The devil's tormented sickness can't function when
We worship and when we pray...
Now how many here within the sound of my voice
Are you ready to tear down walls that have held
Are you ready to let some strongholds fall that have
Then in the name of Jesus Christ I challenge you
Tonight and I dare you...
And trials you've been in...
To leap to your feet right now and make a joyful
I feel Jesus I feel Jesus
I feel Jesus In this place
Yes my soul does Burn within me
I feel Jesus In this place
There's a peaceful breeze of heaven in the air
There's a gentle flow of music everywhere
Something whispers all is well
And assures me child fear not
There's a swell of love overtaking me
And I know it's the presence of God
I feel Jesus in the place
Yes my soul does Burn within me
Joel prophesied that in the end
The Holy Spirit would be poured out on all men
Lord of all the Land and Sea
Lord of all the earth
Lord of all the land and sea
Lord of all the earth
Lord of all the land and sea
Lord of all the earth
The spirit of Jesus is living in me
The Holy Spirit the world cannot see
Praise the Lord our God
Praise the Lord our God
Praise the Lord our God
Praise the Lord our God
Praise the Lord our God
But I tell you most of all
Will go where He sends me
For he's there wherever we roam
But I tell you most of all
I need You more than ever now
I need You more than ever now
I need You more today than
When I first believed
I need You more than ever now
Jesus preached to His crew
Said boys the promise of the Father
Is coming soon to you
For John baptized with water
Y'all thought that was the most
I'm gonna tell you in a little while
You're gonna be baptized in the Holy Ghost
Now all the brothers got together
In the Upper Room saying oh yes
Somebody say we're gonna have
Whatever that is oh Lord
John the beloved was hugging everybody
And kind of talking to himself out loud
Peter said I hope this promise hurries
Cause I got stuff to do
And my newsletter's overdue
We've been in one accord praying for days
And I know that mushy John the beloved
He gonna start hugging me again
You see as long as I've known Jesus
He's been blowing people's minds
I've seen Him cleanse lepers
Change water into wine
I've seen Him heal diseases with no known cure
To straighten out my life when Jesus saw she was dying
You see He's walked on the water
Calm the wind and the waves
Call that dead boy Lazarus
As far as anything supernatural. I can't imagine what else this Man can do
Somebody wanna close the window
Hey we ain't got no windows up here
About you all praying now
This is the Upper Room
We're suppose to be cool man
We're not drunk as you suppose
We're just filled with The Holy Ghost
We're not drunk as you suppose
We're just filled with The Holy Ghost
Joel prophesied that in the end
The Holy Spirit would be poured out on all men
He's moving on all flesh
Soldiers of the cross
And children of the light
Warriors of righteousness with healing in their hands
God's got an army marching through the lands
Let me hear you war cry hay
Let me hear you war cry hay
With ears to hear and hearts to respond
To spiritual needs of the nation
We're a showcase of what he'll do when we are strong
In Jesus to a whole generation
The world won't be the same tomorrow
Because we are here today
The kingdom of hell is gonna feel sorrow
Because our war cry is worship and praise
Soldiers of the cross
And children of the light
Warriors of righteousness with healing in their hands
God's got an army marching through the lands
Let me hear you war cry hay
Let me hear you war cry hay
The apostles and profits are speaking forth
Flames of revival they are burning
Like old Joshua went marching out to possess
There's no way our minds will be turning
There joy in the battle so we commence
To change this nation's course
The kingdom of God suffering violence
Not afraid to fight soldiers of the cross
And children of the light
Warriors of righteousness with healing in their hands
God's got an army marching through the lands
We're not afraid to stand and fight
We cast out demons left and right
We're strong in battle strong in prayer
We tell Satan get out of here
Help me make a joyful sound
Help me make a joyful noise
Come on gimme a shout of victory
Cast off the spirit of worry and doubt
Lift your praises to the sky
We're gonna get down with some church tonight
We gonna dance and we gonna shout
We gonna turn this whole place inside out
Come on gimme a shout of victory
Cast off the spirit of worry and doubt
I get joy when I think about
As his flesh just hung like rivets
As his face they punched and smacked
All the splinters from the criss crossed beam dug deep into his back
When he did some blood splattered
The prophet looked and said
And as they dropped the cross in the hole they dug
His body convulsed with pain
Through the agony and torment
That never a soul shall find
He tilts his face towards heaven
With full control of his mind
With more love then any human heard
Before that time or since
He made a statement that to this day
And as he gave his life for those lost in sin
The Atoning cleansing blood of the Lamb
As his flesh just hung like rivets
As his face they punched and smacked
All the splinters from the criss crossed beam dug deep into his back
When he did some blood splattered
The prophet looked and said
And as they dropped the cross in the hole they dug
His body convulsed with pain
Through the agony and torment
That never a soul shall find
He tilts his face towards heaven
With full control of his mind
With more love then any human heard
Before that time or since
He made a statement that to this day
And as he gave his life for those lost in sin
The Atoning cleansing blood of the Lamb
By the blood of the Lamb
All my sins are washed away
You can talk about me
All my sins are washed away
I've been to the river
And I've been baptized
All my sins are washed away
All my sins are washed away
I love Jesus yes I do
I love Jesus how about you
The bottom line the way to win
Is up with Jesus down with sin
Only Christ can set you free
Christ can set you free
I love Jesus yes I do
For the sentence of destruction's on the forehead of the devil.
Revival is coming to our land
The Holy Ghost is moving just like a hurricane
Revival is coming to our shore
Get ready for the moving of the Spirit of the Lord
It's what we've been waiting for
It's what we've been praying for
From America to England
The Spirit of God is being poured out
On all flesh and there is
They wouldn't let children pray in school
Violent crime began to rise
The grades went down and the kids got high
Today no one knows right from wrong
There's blood on people's hands
Now stand back and see
That it's our turn now
We're gonna bind the devil
When the gates of hell come crashing down
And you begin to see the church arise
With the Ten Commandments on their wall
God's Word in the library won't appear
We have a religious apartheid here
Our consciences have died
We need to seek our God and call His name
We're gonna turn the tide
That it's our turn now
We're gonna bind the devil
When the gates of hell come crashing down
And you begin to see the church arise
We're gonna bind that devil
When the gates of hell come crashing down
You begin to see the church arise
To See those gates of hell crash down
Everybody used to do the twist
The mashed potato and it moves like this
Wasn't nothing they would not do
But there's a new dance no one can stop
A leap for joy we call the Holy Ghost hop
Give the Holy Ghost control now
Rejoice with a grateful heart
Rejoice to the Holy One
Everybody praise Him and rejoice
Hey all you brothers and your sisters too
Don't let tradition tell you what to do
Release your worries and your fears
If King David was here I know that he
Would do the Holy Ghost hop with me
Give the Holy Ghost control now
Rejoice with a grateful heart
Rejoice to the Holy One
I'll magnify You and I will love You
With all of my heart and my soul and my mind
It's time to have some fun now
Rejoice with a grateful heart
Rejoice to the Holy One
Everybody praise Him and rejoice
Let your praises fill the air
Everybody praise Him and rejoice
With a grateful heart rejoice
And he's broken every law
He's terrorized the lives
Of men and he's under arrest
Because I've been sent
With a warrant from the body of Christ
Through Jesus Christ so I talk to you demons like dogs
I command you to appear
I can feel your fear from here
A praying church wants you to know
Your kingdom's gonna fall
Whole new breed of Christian of today
And I'm authorized and
Deputized to blow you clean away
I've got a message to
Deliver from One who's true and just
Take you out by the Spirit and the Word
One by one you'll drop
Like flies under foot and in the ground
Because greater is He who is in me
You'll be the first to go
There's deliverance from you
You ain't welcome here no more
We lay hands on the sick
You've preyed on minds so simple
I'm gonna hit you where it hurts
My family and I'm tired
I'm a Holy Ghost filled man
Your eternal destruction
Whole new breed of Christian of today
And I'm authorized and
Deputized to blow you clean away
I've got a weapon with
Two bullets that overcome all sin and crud
And the other one's called The Blood
The time was 1955 a meal was 40 cents
A Cadillac was the car to drive and Ike was president
Were Holy Ghost electrified by wild evangelists
But nothing could compare
Or none took you quite as high
As being at the tent and hearing people testify
Once all this had ended up to the microphone
With a furnace in his eyes and no time left to play
This human locomotive right there began to say
I believe in a God that sets the captives free
I believe in the blood that flows from Calvary
I'm so glad that the Lord saved me
I'm so glad that the Lord saved me
The power of God was on these men to set those captives free.
But nothing could compare
Or none took you quite as high
As being at the tent and hearing people testify
Woke up with my mind stayed on Jesus and I've been praising Him all day long
Once all this had ended up to the microphone
This human locomotive right there began to say
I'm so glad that the Lord saved me
I'm so glad that the Lord saved me
I'm so glad that the Lord saved me.
I'm so glad that the Lord saved me
I'm so glad that the Lord saved me
I'm so glad that the Lord saved me
There's a silent war that's raging deep within me
My lower nature fights to dominate
My spirit man is poised and locked in battle
With the carnal side of me I've grown to hate.
The trumpet of my prayers plays toward Heaven
A voice of desperation in my cry
But keep Your righteous banner lifted high.
And I thirst for the righteousness that's Yours
That my mind would be cleansed
And my spirit renewed
And this temple that You dwell in would be pure.
The tempter stalks about me as a lion
Searching for the slightest scent of blood
For when the skin of my resistance is broken
He moves in swiftly to deepen the cut.
You understand the weaknesses of man.
I'm counting myself crucified with Jesus
Alive to Christ and dead indeed to sin.
And I thirst for the righteousness that's Yours
That my mind would be cleansed
And my spirit renewed
Let me kick a little slang
I'll tell you all about
Where we power people
With power over demons
We've trained our brains
To know Christ is the
The power of praise can
You've been spurned and
Burned by a life with no
Bust out of prison with
The risen life Saviour
I've got news you can
Without Christ you lose
But if you jam with the
Amputation situation first
Come rock with the flock
With the brothers that
Let me take you to school
People get addicted to new things everyday
But I'll stand with the man who made the blind to see
People they go crazy and don't know when to stop
Drug and crack and heart attack and what do you lose
From top to the very bottom of the list
So don't gimme the fist on addiction
To Christ who paid the price
Died on the cross as a sacrifice for our sin
Me and my boys are addicted to Him
Praise the Lord with your feet
Praise the Lord with your feet
You're life's with God
I was still aware of those around me
I could hear their cries and sense their grief
But was physically incapable
Of responding to them in any way
There was surprisingly no sensation of death
As my spirit and body naturally
And without effort began to separate
An entirely new dimension of reality unfolded
Like the slow opening of a rare flower
Celestial mysteries were revealed from beyond
The atmosphere was permeated
With the healing melody of an invisible choir
And I knew I had entered the domain of the living God
My eyes beheld a vast concourse of souls from every nation
Dressed in the spotless garments of the redeemed
With a loud voice they echoed praises to their King
I saw a mighty throne around which was seated
Four and twenty elders with crowns of glory
And like the sound of rushing waters they began to sing
The whole principle of living was different
Food and water wasn't needed to sustain life
Source of tears or any physical pain
Light did not come from one source like the sun
But God's glory illuminated everything
Suspended like a cube at the expanse of eternity
Fifteen hundred miles high and just as deep as it was wide
Indescribable colors were refracting everywhere
From the precious stones it was made of
With twelve angels guarding the gates
Fashioned from one solid pearl on each side
Of one whose virtue shot through the very fibers of my being
His silhouette was backdropped by the immense sea of glass
And for the very first time
My eyes beheld one altogether lovely
I threw up my hands and cried
His eyes were filled with tenderness
His countenance proclaimed He knew everything
There was to know or ever worth knowing
Being with Him was to have everything I ever wanted
Be everything I ever imagined
And arrive at everywhere I only dreamed of going
Then the same Voice that spoke the worlds into existence
Spoke my name in affectionate tones
Who are deeply grieved at your death
They've prayed I return you to your earthly life
And because of their faithfulness to Me
The limitless wonders of Heaven
If they could steal but one brief glimpse of glory
That I return to the confines of my human body
For You are the resurrection of the life
The Son of the Living God
You're the only one worthy of honor
And glory and power and praise
I'll join the hosts of heaven
Lord of all the Earth
Forever He shall reign
Lord of all the Earth
Forever He shall reign
I was still aware of those around me
I could hear their cries and sense their grief
But was physically incapable
Of responding to them in any way

I feel Jesus I feel Jesus
I feel Jesus In this place
Yes my soul does Burn within me
I feel Jesus In this place
There's a peaceful breeze of heaven in the air
There's a gentle flow of music everywhere
Something whispers all is well
And assures me child fear not
There's a swell of love overtaking me
And I know it's the presence of God
I feel Jesus in the place
Yes my soul does Burn within me
By the hand of the Lord
That Jesus Christ is Lord of all.
Let the church arise.
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
By the blood of the Lamb
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
To the Holy One who sits high upon the throne
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
By the blood of the Lamb
Got our orders ready to fight
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
By the blood of the Lamb
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
Help me make a joyful sound
Help me make a joyful noise
Come on gimme a shout of victory
Cast off the spirit of worry and doubt
Lift your praises to the sky
We're gonna get down with some church tonight
We gonna dance and we gonna shout
We gonna turn this whole place inside out
Come on gimme a shout of victory
Cast off the spirit of worry and doubt
I get joy when I think about
Let me kick a little slang
I'll tell you all about
Where we power people
With power over demons
We've trained our brains
To know Christ is the
The power of praise can
You've been spurned and
Burned by a life with no
Bust out of prison with
The risen life Saviour
I've got news you can
Without Christ you lose
But if you jam with the
Amputation situation first
Come rock with the flock
With the brothers that
I always hear My children when they bow to pray
I never fail to entertain all that they say
I mourn with every sorrow
I grieve with every pain
Yet all the while I'm strengthening and blessing them again
I want so much to be their Source from which they feed
For I and only I can give them what they need
That's why within the pages of My Written Word
Time and time again this simple line is often heard
In that dry and thirsty world you live in
I'll be your cup of water if only you give in
All of the things that I preferred
For those that love Me
But only if you ask of Me
In that dry and thirsty world you live in
I'll be your cup of water if only you give in
In myself I failed the Lord
Then was afraid to try once more
That fire in my soul had fled
My Spirit gives the strength you need
To raise you up and to succeed
And for vision in the night
To you I'll give these words of light
For what belongs to Me
Discouragement is all you'll find
Don't watch the waves that roll the sea
Just focus your eyes on Me
And I will make you strong and then
Your shattered courage I will mend
And if you fall and should get hurt
For what belongs to Me
Abraham refused to say his life was done
When he was a hundred
Abe went and had a son
Moses snatched the Israelites
Into the Promised Land
Can be a hero in God's world
Hall of Faith. Hall of Faith.
Hall of Faith. Hall of Faith.
A boy named David faced Goliath with a sling
That same little boy became a great and mighty king
Even in the lion's den
And Dan walked out again
Can be a hero in God's world
Hall of Faith. Hall of Faith.
Hall of Faith. Hall of Faith.
Can be a hero in God's world
David was a little shepherd boy
David wasn't scared of a thing
One day David went down to the battlefield
Gonna have a little talk with the king.
Dave we got a little problem here
Nobody wasn't looking
Cause nobody didn't care
David came down to the battlefield
But I'll drop you where you stand.
So David went out to face Goliath with only a sling and a stone. He put it above his head and whirled it...
Right now things don't seem to go your way
You think you won't see a brighter day
Your Heavenly Father wants to soothe your troubled mind
I believe somewhere within the night the littlest light shines through
I know that somewhere within the heart of God there's a place for you
Sometimes hearts cry but when your hope is dead
You must remember all the things that Jesus said
I believe somewhere within the night the littlest light shines through
I know that somewhere within the heart of God there's a place for you
Never doubt his heart of love for you
I believe somewhere within the night the littlest light shines through
The ocean is a scary place to go for a stroll
Especially when the skies are dark and waves begin to roll
Peter walked on the water
Faith stepped out on the sea
The world can be a scary place to go for a stroll
Especially when the winds of life make you lose control
But you can walk on the water though difficult it may seem
Trust the Word of God
The next wave holds a miracle
Peter walked on the water
Faith stepped out on the sea
Born... born... born... born... born... born
He was a born to a virgin named Mary on Christmas Day
He bled and he died on the cross to take sin away
Jesus Christ is in the house today
The way is straight and narrow
And few there be that find it today
But there's an angle in the tangle
The solution to pollution of the mind
For two thousand years it's still
You must be born again
Jesus Christ is in the house today
Jesus... You go to Jesus
Jesus... His name is Jesus
Jesus... He's hope for the hopeless
Jesus... The holy one
Jesus... Friend to the friendless
Jesus... God's only son
Jesus... Bread for the hungry
Jesus... For every man
Jesus... For all creation
Jesus Christ is in the house
Here is the jam going cross the land
And a jam that I think you know
It's a groove on the move and a groove you've heard from the Word called the 1-5-0
It's all about praise when the big band plays
And it makes the saints go wild
Bring the glory down with the trumpet sound
With the harp and the lyre everyone can hear
And the people clap their hands
The spirit's right and with all their might
Everyone starts to dance
God is a God of righteousness
God sits on the throne
God is strong in battle
God is wise and merciful
God is sovereign Lord
God reigns forevermore
Ruler over everything
Honor and glory to His Name
God holds up the universe
God sustains the soul
God exalts and God puts down
God's glory is eternal
God is love and grace
Blessing and glory and wisdom
Thanksgiving and honor and power and might
Be to our God forever and ever
And all the saints said
There's a growing root of bitterness
From the heart of Johannesburg
A swelling violent undertow
Has gripped the soul of man
But an integrated cry of hope
Echoes across the land
I hear my brothers say
To let the love of Jesus
Every tongue and every race
All of God's children seek His face
People of promise take your place
Tell of His mercy and His grace
Lift up your voice to the sky
All of God's children testify
We worship You because You are Lord and King
We magnify You because You are the One who reigns
We glorify You because You always remain the same
We worship You because You are Lord and King
We magnify You because You are the One who reigns
We glorify You because You always remain the same
We got no time for hit and miss
The world is full of prejudice
Everybody praise the Lord
He inhabits our praises
Everybody praise the Lord
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter where you've been
It doesn't matter what the scar
It doesn't matter what the sin
It doesn't matter how you fell
Somewhere along the way
There is healing for your life today
From the fountain of God
And it heals everything along the way
I have tasted and know
That for every broken heart
He looks beyond how far you've gone
He looks beyond when you were hurt
He looks beyond who stole your song
He looks beyond what made it worse
He looks beyond where others failed
To reach out to you and say
There's healing for your life today
It's a river that loves
It's a river that lives
It's the river of life
Living water it gives
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
By the blood of the Lamb
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
To the Holy One who sits high upon the throne
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
By the blood of the Lamb
Got our orders ready to fight
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
We've got the victory
By the blood of the Lamb
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
The kingdom of God is on a forceful attack
I'll teach your head how to spread salvation to the nation
Love the Lord with all your heart and mind and soul and strength
To really break it down just repeat these words of mine
Only Christ can set you free
Hide the Word in your heart
When you grow you won't depart
Grind the devil to the ground
They said I'd never make it
They said I would not last a day
They said when things got heated up
I would get blown away
But I'm still here Lord
I got strength to stand
They said I was too fragile
They said I didn't have the stuff
To try and swim up stream
But I'm still here Lord
I got strength to stand
I walk by faith and not by sight
His power is available only for the asking
I got strength to stand
I got strength to stand
Like the flowers love the sun that shines
Like the willow loves the rain
Like a sparrow loves the summer skies
My love for you Lord's the same
Like a mother loves her baby's sigh
Like the ocean loves the shore
Like the heavens love the stars at night
With every passing day I'm sure
Completely and forever more
Could I really tell You how I feel
Could I ever find a way
Could the words I offer You reveal
With every passing day I'm sure
Completely and forever more
With every passing day I'm sure
Completely and forever more
I thank You that You brought me through the fire and the flood
I thank You for the change in me
With every passing day I'm sure
Completely and forever more
With every passing day I'm sure
Completely and forever more
With every passing day I'm sure
Completely and forever more
With every passing day I'm sure
Names synonymous with the spirit of our country
Over 200 years ago they shook off the chains of tyranny from Great Britain
Citing 27 biblical violations they wrote the Declaration of Independence
With liberty and justice for all
But something happened since Jefferson called the Bible the cornerstone
For American liberty then put it in our schools as a light
Our country was founded on the Gospel of Jesus Christ
We eliminated God from the equation of American life
Thus eliminating the reason this nation first began
From beyond the grave I hear the voices of our founding fathers plead
You need God in America again
Of the 55 men who formed the Constitution
Founding fathers like Noah Webster who wrote the first dictionary
Could literally quote the Bible chapter and verse
These men believed you couldn't even call yourself an American
If you subvert the Word of God
To these war zones we call public schools
The only way this nation can even hope to last this decade
Is put God in America again
The only hope for America is Jesus
The only hope for our country is Him
If we repent of our ways stand firm and say
We need God in America again
So when you eliminate the Word of God from the classroom and politics
You eliminate the nation that Word protects
America is now number one in teen pregnancy and violent crime
Everyday a new holocaust of 5,000 unborn die
While pornography floods our streets like open sewers
America's dead and dying hand is on the threshold of the Church
While the spirit of Sodom and Gomorrah vex us all
When it gets to the point where people would rather
Come out of the closet than clean it
It's a sign that the judgment of God is gonna fall
And as the blood bought saints of the living God proclaim
That it's time to sound the alarm from the Church house to the White House
I believe it's time for America to stand up and proclaim
That one nation under God is our demand
And send this evil lifestyle back to Satan where it came from
And let the Word of God revive our dying land
For Jesus Christ is coming back again in all His glory
And every eye shall see Him on that day
That's why a new anointing of God's power's coming on us
To boldly tell the world you must be saved
The Bible says these things are all a farce
History tells us time and time again
To live like there's no God makes you a fool
If you want to see kids live right
Stop handing out condoms and start handing out the Word of God in schools
The only hope for America is Jesus
The only hope for our country is Him
If we repent of our ways
We need God in America again
We need God in America
Jesus Christ is Lord and God's still on the throne.
The world thinks I'm crazy.
You gotta come out from among the rest.
You gotta tell the gospel tale.
The only thing that's gonna change this world is the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Wimpy saints won't survive in spiritual warfare.
On the inside we now stand.
I believe that on the third day Jesus rose from the grave.
The world thinks we're crazy.
Our friends thinks we are crazy.
Our family thinks we're crazy.
A higher level where the devil
Our destination is Salvation
So make sure you check into the right location
And don't forget to get that first class reservation
Which be the blood of the Lamb
Jesus Christ is the captain in command
Fly the friendly skies
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
A three point landing guaranteed
Stay buckled to the word of God
Ain't gonna crash like a kamikaze
So let's keep flying to the sky and
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
God is exalted and Satan is defeated
Webster's dictionary say a riot is like an unrestrained
With the facts we're gonna spread God's Word
And attack every lie you've heard
Like the doctrines of men that are still fallen prey
To the silvery sword of God's Word today
And it's true we've got the gaze of eternity in our eyes
But before this church is raptured
There's no way we're gonna leave here quiet
We want a righteous invasion of truth
With a righteous invasion of truth
Invasion an armed attack
Like a church on the move that will not double back
He's the source of every plague known to the human family
We understand the mortal conflict in which we are engaged
And the gates of hell come crashing down when the saints of God begin to praise
With a righteous invasion of truth
With a righteous invasion of truth
With a righteous invasion of truth
About what the Lord has done for me
I used to be blind but now I see
The devil had me bound
They nailed His hands and feet to a cross
He healed the sick and gave to the poor
Now the Light that shines so bright
How could I do this thing
Never realizing day by day
I so need You in my life
How could I let myself
It seems like a million years
Lord I've been so away so long
Knowing I deserve to be turned away
Come now and let us reason together
Through your sin be as red as scarlet
I'll wash you whiter than snow
I'll wash you whiter than snow
And You forgave my sin
Now where else can I turn but You
No one else cares the way You do
Come now and let us reason together
Though your sin be as red as scarlet
I'll wash you whiter than snow
I'll wash you whiter than snow
Old things have been passed away and all things have become new
That You are faithful and just to forgive us of our sins
And cleanse us of all unrighteousness
It restored my heart and it healed my mind
It restored my heart and it healed my mind
When I stumbled You picked me up off the ground
You gave me hope when my faith was gone
Then You cast my sin far away
And made me clean before You
I remember when You said
Come now and let us reason together
Come now and we can talk it over
Though my sin be as red as scarlet
Then I'd imagine that this dude was after me
I promise you I saw a shadow move
I knew right then exactly what to do
Don't want no monsters in my house tonight
Don't want no monsters in my house
It's time for you to go now
I am a temple of the Holy Ghost
And I'm protected by the Lord of Hosts
Get out in the name of Jesus Christ
I watch him as he chases and he hunts
This peaceful family through the woods with only one thing on his mind
He wants to eat their little kid for lunch
An evil spirit floated by my bed
I could hardly believe the nerve of this little punk demon
Don't want no monsters in my house tonight
Don't want no monsters in my house
It's time for you to go now
I am a temple of the Holy Ghost
And I'm protected by the Lord of Hosts
Get out in the name of Jesus Christ
That we were taught that we could praise the Lord in seven ways
Seven ways to worship God and this is how it goes
It's praise that pushes through the wall of all adversity
An offering that flows to heaven in our time of need
In response to what the Lord has done through the land
An outward sign of what's inside for all the world to see
A demonstration of our love so come praise the Lord with me
In the awesome presence of the Lord and all His power
That you've been given favor by His Holy Majesty
It's praise that's given way before the answer comes about
A public testimony that drowns out all the noise
Of whiners and complainers as the saints all lift their voice
It's playing any instrument that glorifies the Lord
And praise the Lord in such a way that gets you on your toes
It's the one that is the combination of the rest
Seven ways we can say
Above the noise I hear the voice
I do believe and will receive
Within the heart of me the seed of faith
He does accept a baby step
As long as I have kept His word inside
But Jesus knows that I must grow
And tells me I must go ahead and try
It turns me out to think I'd doubt
Someone with so much clout from up above
And yet I see the way that He
Can work with me and do it all in love
And I need someone strong to help me through
I'm ready now to take the vow
And see just what the power of God can do
Now you can do something that's positive but just don't misbehave
Like use your notoriety and get somebody saved
And don't you be so vocal about the truth you know
Live the way you want but your career belongs to me
I have been bought with a price when Jesus hung on a tree
You build up all the pleasure of sin in people's eyes
But never tell the consequences of the compromise
You used to have my number but this time you will fail
There is an answer to all answers
There is a flame that burns in the night
There is an answer to all answers
There is a flame that burns in the night
Oh wave the palm branches
The crowds began to chant
They nailed Him to a cross
Then in a borrowed tomb
The Lamb of God lay dead
Just before the sun came over the eastern sky
The trees began to rattle and the birds began to fly
And the earth started to rumble and the stone was rolled away
He walked alive out of the grave
Lift your voice and sing
Flows from Calvary's mountain.
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.
There the bright and morning Star
Shed its beams around me.
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.
Help me walk from day to day
With its shadow o'er me.
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.
Till I reach the golden strand
Just beyond the river.
Till my raptured soul shall find
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone.
Sin had left a crimson stain
But He washed it white as snow
He washed it white as snow
For nothing good have I
I'll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calvary's Lamb
Sin had left a crimson stain
But He washed it white as snow
He washed it white as snow
My lips shall still repeat.
Sin had left a crimson stain
But He washed it white as snow
Sin had left a crimson stain
But He washed it white as snow
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
O precious is the flow
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
O precious is the flow
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
O precious is the flow
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
O precious is the flow
And in simple faith to plunge me
Just from Jesus simply taking
Wilt be with me to the end.
We can't contain what's inside
Thunder and lightning can't hide
Taking the Gospel where it's never been
To know Him and make Him known is our creed
Letting the fire be freed
We don't know what we will find
Deep behind enemy lines
Ready to serve Him and willing to do
He did not come into the world
He came so He could set us free
The message of salvation to live
Living for the Lord is the better way
Raising up a banner of righteousness
This generation needs to hear it now
And demonstrated with God's power
Satan lost the war and no doubt it works
And strong in the spirit
This generation needs to hear it now
And demonstrated with God's power.
Never be a heart that He
Couldn't mend each broken piece
Never be a wounded soul He would ignore
There'll never a time that He
Would ever turn his back on me
There'll never be a life He can't restore
Where do you go when you feel like
What do you do when your dreams have
Been broken and shattered
There is a Man standing with arms ope wide
Drying the tears that I've cried
Loving me and giving love
Never be a heart that He
Couldn't mend each broken piece
Never be a wounded soul He would ignore
There'll never a time that He
Would ever turn his back on me
There'll never be a life He can't restore
Never will I doubt again
I will never be without a friend
Never will me eyes fail to see
What the Lord did for me
Never be a heart that He
Couldn't mend each broken piece
Never be a wounded soul He would ignore
There'll never a time that He
Would ever turn his back on me
Never be a heart that He
Couldn't mend each broken piece
Never be a wounded soul He would Ignore
There'll never be a time that He
Would ever turn His back on me
There'll never be a life He can't restore
Where do you go when you feel like
Been broken and shattered
Drying the tears that I've cried
Loving me and giving life
Never will I doubt again
I will never be without a friend
Never will my eyes fail to see
What the Lord did for me
Jesus is the Lamb that was slain
Jesus is the Lamb that was slain
It's the easiest thing for me to stand and say
Love You from the bottom of my heart
And may I add I'd love to
Tell everyone I know just who you are
Counting every time You've heard my lonesome cry
You've committed to never ever pass me by
Thankful just to know that You are near
May I add I'd love to
Sing to every soul who wants to hear
Heaven and earth must now proclaim
Glory to God the people say
Sent from heaven and rejected
Crucified and resurrected
Holy is the Lamb that was slain
Holy is the Lamb that was slain
If tonight you stood in heaven's court to seek eternal favor...
So let's imagine for a moment you're standing dead center...
In the Courtroom of Forever...
Sitting before you is a structure massive and intense.
It's here where your fate will be determined before this Judge's bench...
And your adrenaline starts to rush.
Peering down with eyes that see through your soul...
Then off to your left across the room...
He's gonna accuse you of your sins and he knows them all... Both the old ones and the new.
So in arrogance he presents his case to the Judge and it comes out sounding something like this...
Then God opens the book where every deed is recorded and reviews your record of disgrace.
In the Courtroom of Eternity.
He turns to the first page...
God sets the book down...
If you've been forgiven...
And your name is written...
My name is in that book...
My name is in that book tonight...
I've been forgiven...
And I know my name is written...
In the Lamb's Book of Life...
Our Father which art in Heaven
On Earth as it is in Heaven
And forgive us our debts
As we forgive our debtors
Forever and ever and ever and ever
Some people wonder why we take the chances that we do
To bring the word of God into the workplace and the schools
We're looked upon as outcasts
Fanatics they may say
So why then do we still persist
To share our faith this way
We are not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
We are not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
For it is power of salvation
For those of you who fight in the wars
Against our nations sins
Heroes who give so much more than is required of them
For those of you who paid the price
Beyond what words can say
Remember that you're not alone
With the cross you bear each day
With our wounds deeper than ours
That's why no child of God
Should be embarrassed by their scars
Let's stand up and proclaim...
That it's the Gospel that saved me
And the Gospel raised me
Daniel was in trouble in the lion's den
But he knew what prayer was all about
Daniel trusted God and he got out again
Moses told the pharaoh back in Egypt land
They headed for the promised land
Peter saw the Master walking on the sea
You said that I would stumble
You said I wouldn't last
You said that I would crumble
From all that's in my past
You tried to break me
Tried to take me with your lies
Tried to chop me down to size
Tried to rush me and attack
But Jesus Christ is in my life
Slam temptation with the Word
I can slam each lie that I have heard
I can slam the devil on his back
The word of God will stop the attack
In my mind there is no fear
In my mind there is no doubt
Yes I am that Christian that hell warned you about
You told me it was useless
That I would never change
You told me it was hopeless
That I never would get saved
Tried to plug me up with guilt
Tried to boot my mind on tilt
Tried to bill me for my sin
But the blood has washed me clean
If I don't glorify Your name
Help me remember this truth I've learned
That Kingdoms come and Kingdoms go
But though the Word of God I know
When all in life is done and past
Only what's done for Christ will last
To sacrifice and reach a star
But then lose sight of who You are
To gain the world and lose the soul
My spirit can understand
Lord I lift Your name on high
Lord I love to sing Your praises
I'm so glad You're in my life
I'm so glad You came to save us
You came from Heaven to Earth
From the Earth to the Cross
From the Cross to the Grave
From the Grave to the Sky
We humble ourselves now as we pray
Renouncing every sin and wicked way
I feel Jesus I feel Jesus
I feel Jesus In this place
Yes my soul does Burn within me
I feel Jesus In this place
There's a peaceful breeze of heaven in the air
There's a gentle flow of music everywhere
Something whispers all is well
And assures me child fear not
There's a swell of love overtaking me
And I know it's the presence of God
I feel Jesus in the place
Yes my soul does Burn within me
Here is the jam going cross the land
And a jam that I think you know
It's a groove on the move and a groove you've heard from the Word called the 1-5-0
It's all about praise when the big band plays
And it makes the saints go wild
Bring the glory down with the trumpet sound
With the harp and the lyre everyone can hear
And the people clap their hands
The spirit's right and with all their might
Everyone starts to dance
Our Father which art in Heaven
On Earth as it is in Heaven
And forgive us our debts
As we forgive our debtors
Forever and ever and ever and ever
Today let's just look back over our lives
Everything that the Lord has done
Give thanks to the Holy One
Give thanks because He's
Given Jesus Christ His Son
And now let the weak say I am strong
Let the poor say I am rich
Because of what the Lord has done for us
I love you Lord and I wanna give thanks
Give thanks to the Holy One
Give thanks because He's
Given Jesus Christ His Son
And now let the weak say I am strong
Let the poor say I am rich
Because of what the Lord has done for us
Can you lift up your heart...
Tell Him that you love Him
By the blood of the Lamb
All my sins are washed away
You can talk about me
All my sins are washed away
I've been to the river
And I've been baptized
All my sins are washed away
All my sins are washed away
I love Jesus yes I do
I love Jesus how about you
The bottom line the way to win
Is up with Jesus down with sin
Only Christ can set you free
Christ can set you free
I love Jesus yes I do
Thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
Thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
Thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
Thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
Lord we praise You Lord we praise You
Lord we praise You Lord we praise You
Lord we praise You Lord we praise You
Lord we praise You Lord we praise You
Lord I love You Lord I love You
Lord I love You Lord I love You
Lord I love You Lord I love You
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth
Because after that time the earth was without form
And void and darkness was over the face of the deep
But a phenomenon was about to take place
Because the Spirit of God was hovering over those waters
That's why after all this time I can stand here and say
When He rolls up His sleeves
Our God is and awesome God
There is thunder in His footsteps And lightning in His fists
Our God is an awesome God
The Lord wasn't joking
It wasn't for no reason
That he shed His blood
His return is very close
And so you better be believing that
Our God is an awesome God
Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from Heaven above
With wisdom power and love
Our God is an awesome God
And when the sky was starless
In the void of the night
Our God is an awesome God
He spoke into the darkness
And created the light
Our God is an awesome God
He poured out on Sodom
Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross
I hope that we have not
Too quickly forgotten that
Bless the name of Jesus
Praise the name of Jesus
Sing unto the King of Israel
Glory to His name forever
It's all over the floor
It's all up in the walls
That we are in the House of Praise
We've got more praise to give
Stand up make a joyful noise
Stand up make a joyful noise
Stand up give Him praise
Stand Up and give Him praise.
I gotta let this praise come out.
I've been alone and I've been forgotten
I know what it feels like to be on the bottom.
Nothing to look forward to and nobody there.
I've felt the grip of the spirit that takes you
Under the ways of depression that makes you
Numb to the feeling of hope and you just don't care.
More and more each day.
Feel I've lost my way.
Will find You through the maze
Of all of my confusion when I pray.
That You're there for me
That You're with me still.
And I need to hear You say
That You love me and You always will.
I know it's not a one way street
You need to hear from me.
That I'm there for You
That I'm with You still
And You need to hear me say
But now I'm on a whole new avenue.
Bow I see new hope for me
Going where I've never been
We serve a good God here today.
Let me tell you a little bit about Him.
There is somewhere I know I can go.
He healed my body and He healed my mind.
He healed my body and he healed my mind.
You didn't wait for any of us to get our act cleaned up.
For You were the cleaning up of our act.
I am what it says I am
I have what it says I have
I'll do what it says I'll do
It has given me new life
It is the Word of God
When I'm lost and gone astray
It helps me find my way
When I quote it I well see
The devil has to flee
I am what it says I am
I have what it says I have
I'll do what it says I'll do
It has given me new life
All my friends been wondering
Since I took my stand for Christ
You see they're wondering just what's in store
That's when the Lord stirs up my soul
And I quite clearly say...
Testifying child of the King
And then I'll dream about witnessing.
I'm gonna walk and talk and act like Jesus
Though I may get feathered and tarred
The expressions on their faces change
You know the looks they give are priceless
Well I'm proud to be living for Jesus
It's all over the floor
It's all up in the walls
That we are in the House of Praise
We've got more praise to give
Stand up make a joyful noise
Stand up make a joyful noise
Stand up give Him praise
Stand Up and give Him praise.
I gotta let this praise come out.
You didn't wait for any of us to get our act cleaned up.
For You were the cleaning up of our act.

When I'm lost and gone astray

Strength will rise as we wait upon
We will wait upon the Lord
We will wait upon the Lord
Strength will rise as we wait upon
We will wait upon the Lord
We will wait upon the Lord
You are the everlasting God
You're the defender of the weak
You comfort those in need
You lift us up on wings like eagles
Strength will rise as we wait upon
We will wait upon the Lord
We will wait upon the Lord
Strength will rise as we wait upon
We will wait upon the Lord
King of righteousness
He's enshrined as sovereign king every way
He's the king of the heaven the ages and more
He's the king of all kings
And he is the lord of lords
He's entirely sincere
He's eternally steadfast
He's immortally graceful
With the impartial mercy he's shown
He's been misinterpreted and misrepresented
As the greatest phenomenon this world has ever known
His limitless love for all mankind
Still the one true only way
He's the loftiest idea
In all literature read
In the philosophers head
The real of the master of the universe
I wanna let everybody know
He's strength for the weak
For the tempted and tried
He sustains and leads
He defends the feeble
To the down and wounded
He rewards the diligent
Turns losers to winners
Discharges the debtors
He forgives all the sinners
After 2000 years he still saves and
Delivers and he heals.
He's limitless in goodness
His grace is sufficient
He's the key to all knowledge
And the pathway to every good thing
He's the highway to righteousness
Compassion to indifference
He's the wellspring of wisdom
He's the doorway to deliverance
You can't live without him
And you can't out live him
Everybody knows that's my king
I want everybody know that's my king
I wish I could describe him
But he's indescribable
He's so incomprehensible
He's the most irresistible intoxicant
You will ever hear about
He'll make you wanna sing
He'll make you clap your hands
He'll make you wanna testify
And preach to every man
He'll make you wanna stand up
Their questions no problem
The pharisees couldn't stand him
They all couldn't stop him
Soldiers couldn't scare him
Nobody could make him leave town
Pilate couldn't find any fault in him
Angry mob couldn't chill him
The cross didn't slow him
Death couldn't handle him
And the grave couldn't hold him down
Everybody know that's my king
He's the king of righteousness
He's king of the heavens
He's king of all kings
He's the loftiest idea
In all literature read
He's immortally graceful
He's entirely sincere
He defends the feeble
To the down and wounded he's a shield
He discharges the debtors
He still saves delivers and heals
His grace is sufficient
He's the wellspring of wisdom
He's the doorway to deliverance
As his flesh just hung like rivets
As his face they punched and smacked
All the splinters from the criss crossed beam dug deep into his back
When he did some blood splattered
The prophet looked and said
And as they dropped the cross in the hole they dug
His body convulsed with pain
Through the agony and torment
That never a soul shall find
He tilts his face towards heaven
With full control of his mind
With more love then any human heard
Before that time or since
He made a statement that to this day
And as he gave his life for those lost in sin
The Atoning cleansing blood of the Lamb
Keeping watch over their flock by night
And the glory of the Lord shone around them
And they were greatly afraid
For unto You is born this day
For unto You is born this day
And this shall be a sign to know
A baby wrapped in swaddling clothes
Lying in the manger lo
For unto You is born this day
For unto You is born this day
And this shall be a sign to know
A baby wrapped in swaddling clothes
He will be lying in a manger lo
For unto a child is born
Unto us a Son is given
And the government will be upon His shoulder
And His name will be called
Of the increase of his government and peace
Upon the throne of David and over his kingdom
To order it and establish it
With judgment and justice
From that time forward and even forevermore
And the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this
And this shall be a sign to know
A baby wrapped in swaddling clothes
He will be lying in a manger lo
And this shall be a sign to know
A baby wrapped in swaddling clothes
He will be lying in a manger lo
For unto You is born this day
Unto You is born this day
Moses knew it way back in Egypt land
My God will take care of me
My God will take care of me
And walk me through the valley of shadow and death again
My God will take care of me
Written by the finger of God back then
Written on stone and the hearts of man
My God will take care of me
My God will take care of me
And walk me through the valley of shadow and death again
My God will take care of me
And walk me through that valley of shadow and death again
My God will take care of me
And walk me through that valley of shadow and death again
Names synonymous with the spirit of our country
They wrote the Declaration of Independence
With liberty and justice for all
But something happened since Jefferson called the Bible
The cornerstone for American liberty
Then put it in our schools as a light or since
Our country was founded on the Gospel of Jesus Christ
We eliminated God from the equation of American life
Thus eliminating the reason this nation first began
From beyond the grave I hear the voices of our founding fathers plead
You need God in America again
Of the 55 men who formed the Constitution
Fifty two were active members of their Church
Founding fathers like Noah Webster who wrote the first dictionary
Could literally quote the Bible chapter and verse
These men believed you couldn't even call yourself an American
If you subvert the Word of God
To these war zones we call public schools
The only way this nation can even hope to last this decade
Is to put God in America again
The only hope for America is Jesus
The only hope for our country is Him
So when you eliminate the Word of God from the classroom
America is now number one in teen pregnancy and violent crime
Every day a new holocaust of 5,000 unborn die
While pornography flood our streets like open sewers
America's dead and dying hand is on the threshold of the Church
While the spirit of Sodomy and Gomorrah vex us all
When it gets to the point where people would rather
Come out of the closet than clean it
It's the sign that the judgment of God is gonna fall
And as the blood bought saints of the living God proclaim
That it's time to send the alarm from the Church house
I believe it's time America to stand up and proclaim
That one nation under God is our demand
And send this evil lifestyle back to Satan where it came from
And let the Word of God revive our dying land
For Jesus Christ is coming back again in all His glory
And every eye shall see Him on that day
That's why a new anointing of God's power's coming on us
To boldly tell the world you must be saved
The Bible says these things are all farce
History tells us time and time again
To live like there's no God makes you a fool
And start handing out the Word of God in schools
The only hope for America is Jesus
The only hope for our country is Him
I know the only hope for America is Jesus
We need God in America
There is a spiritual fight
We cannot see with our eyes
Between the angels of light
And the demons from the dark side
This power if you believe
But you got to fight on your knees
In the midst of any circumstance
As long as you are on God side
The power of hell cannot defeat the light
It's war to win your every trial
Now Jericho was tightly shut up
Because of the children of Israel
None went out and none came in
And the Lord said unto Joshua
And the king there of and the mighty men of valor
Thus shalt thou do six days
And seven priests shall bear before
The ark seven trumpets of rams horns
And the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times
And the priests shall blow the trumpets
And it shall come to pass
That when they make a long blast with the ram's horn
And when ye hear the sound of the trumpet
All the people shall shout with a great shout
And the wall of the city shall fall down flat
And the people shall ascend up every man straight before him
For the Lord hath said unto Joshua
The inhabitants of Jericho were perverted by sin and corrupt
Stood waiting for commands of war to come
Trained under Moses righteous hand
And it was Joshua who led nearly
Three million Israelites into the promised land
Now Moses was dead and the real test came could
He simply follow God's word and do something
That to the natural mind would be utterly absurd
Without Moses to ask advice of or an advisory committee
Setting at our disposal weaponry that drops demons to the floor
Something with tremendous power that assassinates fear and doubt
It lifts us above the circumstance and lets God's power flow
The shout of victory binds the Devil with chains that won't let go
So with the confidence of warring angels
Israel stood stone ready to obey Joshua
Speak to their mountain and shout
For God was giving them the city
And the last day they marched seven
While the Canaanites jeered from their evil wall
Israel's faith reached heaven before any manifestation
They looked fear dead in its face
They didn't wait to feel some Earthquake or to see a lightening flash
They didn't need to hear a theatric rumble or a mind blowing crash
They prepared their souls for victory
Now its God's turn to come through
They'd scream their lungs out simply
Because they believed God's word was true
So with the high praises of God in their mouths
And Israel shouted in victory and they shouted in faith
And the walls came tumbling down
Now this is where we come in
Now how many know the anointing breaks the yolks
When the anointed move in spontaneous praise of man
When we worship and when we pray
Are you ready to tear down walls
You sick and tired of being down and out
You ready to ransack the kingdom of darkness
You ready to let some strong holds fall
Then in the name of Jesus Christ I challenge you tonight
And trials you've been in.
To leap up on your feet right now
Make a joyful noise and praise the Lord
Put on the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness
Lift up your voice and sing
Wanna look good I'll tell you how
First gotta paint on you're eyebrows
Spray you're hair with Aqua Net
Get a tattoo to rep your set
Need a gallon of mascara
Thick eye liner in my eye
Got four kids with three guys
Thick eye liner in my eye
Got four kids with three guys
Speak Spanish when they speak
My man's been locked up forevers
When he gets out he'll be mad
That his boy's my baby's dad
Got a blade in my hair when I fight
Thick eye liner in my eye
Got four kids with three guys
Thick eye liner in my eye
Got four kids with three guys
Praise Him in the noon time
Love Him in the noon time
Serve Him in the noon time
And there is no one better step 4 stroke
And as you peep the scheme of things
I step into my 4 by 6 cell now
But in my mouth's a bad taste
This situation I'm sometimes placed
Is it art or just a display of
Every day and night no matter what I do
You know you gotta get wild 2 tolerate this world 2 day
Life of the party night after night
I work my butt off while the women roll their eyes
This is your last chance
I gather I'll receive most of my flack from the latter
Hard work is how you make it
You must always take stock in your self wealth
About face while I precede with my case
So I jack 2 the dance floor
You could say I'm from around the way
How profound that sounds like love on the rebound
Open your mind to the power of the body
Physical love is the name of this party
She likes the music that makes her pull up her dress
He likes to watch as she pumps on her own caress
Make my fantasy your game
Whatever you wish four me to do
I'm a product of your thought so I know nothing of pride
She says as she disappears and he hears
Feel the vibe and let's move it
Never losing out the funk that we got
Gonna give you more of what you want for damn sure
Skip the talk and just dance
And if it's too much then get the lead out your...
Ask me no questions and I'll tell no lies
Microphone swiftness is my business
Two times in the center as I kick a riddle
My name is Carmen Electra and I ain't in the middle
This kind of funky beat is what I dream
So if you want to get a feel of this cream
Get the wallflower people all out of the corner
So as I think slowly and try 2 decide
People will try 2 put me in
A category 4 which there is no room 4 expansion
Because the fruit is bountiful
Turn me over slowly and I guarantee a mouthful
Of a nectar so sweet guaranteed 2 keep you youthful
A hot tasty hors d'oeuvre
Passion is in the fruit and I can't stand it
And that would be just 2 scandalous
So as I simmer basted with a touch of honey 2 give me a glimmer
Or should I say shimmer of sweetness
Pound 4 pound I can see no weakness
If you think you're praising me then don't even bother
Turn it up a little louder
She doesn't even know my name
These days it's very hard 2 be chosen
So as the aromas fill the room
And the smell of sugar and cinnamon looms
Aromatic in its blend
And there's plenty 4 you 2 choose from on the menu my friends
And every now and then try something different and you'll find
And at this moment I think it's time I release it
This jam is 4 that special someone
Whoever that someone may be
Like a new dress or a new hat
In my dictionary there's a picture of you
It gets me all groovy
Psychedelic flashes appear
I'm like a spider in heat in this web of love that you've spun
I'm in a little bit of trouble and I'm in real deep
From the beginning to the end he was no more than a friend to me
Twisting round on a carousel
This speed's too much to stop
And then I feel a lie
My only sin is I can't win
My only sin is I can't win
Now it's like I'm on a mission headed everywhere
My baby fits the description and does it easily
Someone call a doctor
Need some help to rescue me
My only sin is I can't win
My only sin is I can't win
I'm gonna find that man
My only sin is I can't win
On Riverside at 42239
Hey handsome have you got the time
I've been watching you since the moment you arrived
Don't you wanna spend about an hour with me
The scent and the aroma refuses to breathe
It's more like a haze that's trying to succeed
It's drawing me in and pulling me to you
And every thought I have turns the language blue
All it cost is just a minute now
For one dollar you can show me how
I'll take your hand and then your worries too
In just one dance I'll make your dreams come true
Don't know why you play hard to get
I'm here to kiss away any thoughts of regret
A silk tie from Siam shows elegance and class
Handsome as the heavens that a film would never cast
But underneath the mask I see the skin of a man
Smooth and seductive who's really got a plan
All it cost is just a minute now
For one dollar you can show me how
I'll take your hand and then your worries too
In just one dance I'll make your dreams come true
Your dreams come true
I'll make your dreams come true
I'm like the smoke on your fire
Smoldering endless desire
How long will your flame burn
All it cost is just a minute now
For one dollar you can show me how
I'll take your hand and then your worries too
In just one dance I'll make your dreams come true
All it cost is just a minute now
For one dollar you can show me how
I'll take your hand and then your worries too
I'm really tired of my concrete jungle
Six days a week is way too much
I'm gonna make the great escape
Go on a little getaway
I'll go get my beat up motor
Start it up and head for the green
Of endless countrysides
And go somewhere I've never been
Breathe until I soar outside my crazy nights
I'm sure that by candlelight I'll be all right
The road can wind like my hidden hair bow
You clear my face so I can feel the breeze
And down below it's Monaco
I'll drop off the keys at valet
Look out my window bay
One afternoon martini
Wouldn't want it any other way
Breathe until I soar outside my crazy nights
I'm sure that by candlelight I'll be all right
So whenever my eyes get weary
I'm not fearing what life brings
Forever when times make me teary
Breathe until I soar outside my crazy nights
I'm sure that by candlelight I'll be all right
So get that needle in the core
Scratch that back and gimme more
Back it up and do it again
From the middle to the top to the end
Back to the middle to the front to the end
I don't care if he's a friend
From the front to the middle to the back to the end
Back it up and do it again
Gimme some of that funky
The kind that the duke used to play and make it more swingy
Slam that bass and make it sing
Back it up and do it again
From the middle to the top to the end
Back to the middle to the front to the end
I don't care if he's a friend
From the front to the middle to the back to the end
Back it up and do it again
Get that needle in the core
Scratch that back and gimme more
Back it up and do it again
From the middle to the top to the end
Back to the middle to the front to the end
I don't care if he's a friend
From the front to the middle to the back to the end
Back it up and do it again
For that man to give you a life
Keep on dreaming his scandalous lie
Does he know that you begging him please
In your despair does he get up to leave
At the start of his goodbye
That you never get the chance
All you get is alibis
When smoke begins to fade
And you're standing face to face
Keep on wishing almost all of him cares
And don't you pretend you don't live what you breathe
At the start of his goodbye
That you never get the chance
All you get is alibis
When smoke begins to fade
And you're standing face to face
You'll always be the other woman
You'll always be the other woman
At the start of his goodbye
That you never get the chance
All you get is alibis
When smoke begins to fade
And you're standing face to face
All you handsome fellas
Please wait for me to the right
Don't keep me waiting
It's quarter past eleven
I'm not in the mood to think
Let's kick out the jam
Gimme something that'll light it up
Cause Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
Are impossible you see
But when it gets to Friday
I said Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
Are impossible for me
But once it gets to Friday
Sweeter than the candy
About to caress my lips
Imagine all the sugar
When I start to shake my hips
I'm as live as I can be
Instead of all your promises
Why don't you show all your charms to me
This arrangement has to change
Gimme something that'll light it up
Cause Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
Are impossible you see
But when it gets to Friday
I said Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
Are impossible for me
But once it gets to Friday
Cause Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
Are impossible you see
But when it gets to Friday
I said Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
Are impossible for me
But once it gets to Friday
Is someone like me his destiny he'll never know
I gotta find a way to show my expectations
He ends it where it begins but I won't let go
I know you don't love me
But still I burn for you
I know you don't love me
My soul barred completely
Don't seem enough for you
I know you don't love me
But the message can't get through
But I feel a fire inside that's about to blow
You gotta understand a girl needs more than romance
I know you don't love me
But still I burn for you
I know you don't love me
My soul barred completely
Don't seem enough for you
I know you don't love me
But the message can't get through
Maybe I'm missing the telepathy
I don't really care because I disagree
Maybe I'm missing the telepathy
I don't really care because I disagree
I know you don't love me
But still I burn for you
I know you don't love me
My soul barred completely
Don't seem enough for you
I know you don't love me
But the message can't get through
Don't seem enough for you
I just made an appointment
To see a man of miracles
And all that he can do
I checked in at reception
Put my hat onto my lap
And when he walked in dressed in white
Dr. Do anything that ya Wanna Do
Dr. Do anything that ya Wanna Do
I sat down and I waited
It's like I'm at the races
And I think I won them all
He asked me to step forward
For endless observation
In the hands of Superman
Dr. Do anything that ya Wanna Do
Dr. Do anything that ya Wanna Do
Come over here and give me some medicine
Move a little closer so my head can spin
A little bit of potion makes my fever go
Get it out of me me like a volcano
Dr. Do anything that ya Wanna Do
I close my eyes and dream about a sunny holiday
I wish that I was beaching down on Saint Tropez
With diamonds on my fingers and not a single care
With fields of green that wilted like a last summer rose
Some people call it paradise but I call it pain
Standing here with nothing to do
Wondering if I really love you
Standing here with nothing to do
Wondering if I really love you
You promised me a motorcade and endless perfume
A palace in Geneva with a perfect view
And dreams painted yellow like the color of gold
Instead I'm on the edge of all I thought I would be
This dream is now a comedy I don't wanna see
Standing here with nothing to do
Wondering if I really love you
Standing here with nothing to do
Wondering if I really love you
I know we have a chemistry
This combination's heavenly
But don't forget you promised me everything
I know we have a chemistry
This combination's heavenly
But don't forget that you promised me everything
Standing here with nothing to do
Wondering if I really love you
Standing here with nothing to do
Wondering if I really love you
Three o'clock on a late Sunday morning
The candles have burned to their end
Found the pictures we've taken
And now I'm awaken and
Sleep's my invisible friend
So I'm staring the hands off my wall clock
Seems both of us just hang around
Got no one to warm me
My body needs what it don't have
He'll make up in time
As long as he loves me
He'll answer his crime
The door stays wide open
I know that he's mine
I'm melting the cold in the halls
There's no one around
And now I'm just climbing the walls
Perhaps if I played the seductress
A passionate woman of guile
He'd be there in a minute
The heat won't diminish
He'd wear nothing more than a smile
He'll make up in time
As long as he loves me
He'll answer his crime
The door stays wide open
I know that he's mine
Your words always make so much sense
And though they're in French
I know that I'm reaching the end
It's you I refuse to believe
He knows that I'm home now
And nobody calls me naive
He'll make up in time
As long as he loves me
He'll answer his crime
The door stays wide open
You see the smoke start to arise where they play cards
And you walk over softly moving passed the guards
And now it's more than all this cards you want to touch
You never know if winning this could really be enough
When everything you think is incomplete
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
And opened up to see my world before my eyes
Creates an image on the night I can't forget
When everything you think is incomplete
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
When everything you think is incomplete
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
The clock has ticked eleven and the place is clear
Reality is kicking in and so is my beer
I don't make excuses when it's all my fault
If a heart is made of money he's cleaned out my vault
I feel a little wounded and it isn't fair
To sit inside a parlor and see him standing over there
As smug as a robber that a cop can't catch
The lipstick on his collar doesn't seem to match mine
Now Joe behind the bar is offering advice
Why don't I understand that he just can't change
I wanna be his woman not his weekend dame
And he'll be back tomorrow for my heartbeat crash
Though the lipstick on his collar never seems to match mine
This line is disconnected
Is heaven and it's hell
I don't know where I stand
My life is but a rumor
They're flying in the press
Why can't they understand
My life is not a mess
Even if the words are all untrue
You will see the moon and every star
Declare it from above
The world will feel a spark
Feel it in the day and in the dark
The day it's really love
For now I'm in a prison
When papers start a fire
They're started by a liar
I'll walk out in the lobby
It's one day in the life
But it cuts like a knife
Even if the words are all untrue
You will see the moon and every star
Declare it from above
The world will feel a spark
Feel it in the day and in the dark
The day it's really love
I'm immune to anything they do
You will see the moon and every star
Declare it from above
The world will feel a spark
Feel it in the day and in the dark
But something has me really turning red
With all the Romeos and their goodbyes
It's not just me I talk about
Our age is on the way
All the money in the women's world will never make him change
Gonna grab the yellow pages
To dress me up and make me look like someone else instead
I'm coming back as a man
And find a pair of flat black leather shoes
But shine more than a diamond mine could do
And add something new
That says you are the man I'm gonna own
I drop a hint and then my keys
And then I cast a net
To catch someone who's in for such a night he won't forget
Gonna grab the yellow pages
To dress me up and make me look like someone else instead
I'm coming back as a man
Remove that false impression to make sure the feeling lasts
Call me the equalizer for the girls
Gonna grab the yellow pages
To dress me up and make me look like someone else instead
With all the money in the world
You could never buy this girl
If romancing me with neons is something you should do
Making it from my love
To me you're acting like you're twins
Till only one of you is left
I want to see emotions coloring the sky
To the point it will make me wanna cry
Making it from my love
If playing with your string had lanced to be your thing
Making it from my love
I recall the days that I was single
And suddenly it changed completely
And others keep on playing
Now I know it's wrong
Each and every night before I sleep
When I look up at the stars in the galaxy near and far
I look at you and I sure see a genius
It's kinda crazy like you don't think I mean this
You filled up my heart
And I know that I changed completely
Each and every night before I sleep
When I look up at the stars in the galaxy near and far
I still feel protected
I'm happy my life changed completely
Your feel got my heart
Someone with no clue of the destination due bow
A trophy because you slipped
Love can't conquer anything
If it's lost without a trace
But not when you're in this place
They make lovers blind when they cover every inch of their lies
A smoke and some wine is the life of the Black Valentine
Your ticket isn't worth half of what it hurts
When heart beats overwork
Someone caries dreams from scene to scene
Till they tear apart your mind
Love can't conquer anything
If it's hurting in the deep
That's not someone you should keep
They make lovers blind when they cover every inch of their lies
A smoke and some wine is the life of the Black Valentine
It's a will they came to pose in a letter left they've composed
To repeat the situation
They make lovers blind when they cover every inch of their lies
The clock rings and it's half past eleven
Can't believe it but the time just flies
Soon I'll be on a cruise into heaven
About the things that I'd never do
Experience that I don't have
And I can't leave a thing behind
For every different change of mind
I got a pocket for every reason
Every season be another day
We're gonna I pack it up every day
Lock it up and we're on our way
Tango listener all night long
Two days and we're heading off to Rio
Kind of running from morning till dawn
Do Havana down the emerald way
But before I get on the line
I think I'm leaving today
And I can't leave a thing behind
For every different change of mind
I got a pocket for every reason
Every season be another day
I gotta get to Pier 19
Pier 19 on the west side
For a lady in despair
Can you help little me
Get this fabulous trunk in the air
And I can't leave a thing behind
For every different change of mind
I got a pocket for every reason
Every season be another day
We're gonna I pack it up every day
Lock it up and we're on our way
Under the stars the shines one light
I asked the sun to tell the moon that two of us are there
The afterglow that's down below
Is when I see your smile
Forever is a word that cries
That endless nights are far away
Could never never never
I see you don't look down and now I feel the truth
We overlooked as ocean deep
But now this river that we're swimming through is promises we keep
One we never would allow
There is no heart that chance will break
Nothing else could ever stop us now
That endless nights are far away
Could never never never
I see you don't look down and now I feel the truth
The afterglow that's down below
Is when I see your smile
Forever is a word that cries
That endless nights are far away
Could never never never
I see you don't look down and now I feel the truth
Behind those steely eyes
Anything you know is coincidence
He's always dressed for fame
Let a girl dream a bit
I'd be out of my mind
A gift he can't buy from you
But if I had to pay I'd sure find a way to break the bank
I'd break the bank that day
The magic's in his mind
Let a girl dream a bit
I'd be out of my mind
A gift he can't buy from you
But if I had to pay I'd sure find a way to break the bank
I'd break the bank that day
I know I did it to myself but man oh man it hurts
Set me on the bender with nothing left to lose
I just can't apologize
For what I did to myself
My bed's an ocean liner
And I can't call for help
The girl's got going and we had a munch
I promise on a dime it's the last time
I'll never have a liquid lunch
I think I've got the symptoms and none of them will leave
They think that it's a party to laugh at all my grieve
It's hard to remember
But I must've faded out
The girl's got going and we had a munch
I promise on a dime it's the last time
I'll never have a liquid lunch
Maybe I can call the pharmacy
Some exotic medicine to cure my every ill
With some kind of magic pill
I just can't apologize
For what I did to myself
My bed's an ocean liner
And I can't call for help
The girl's got going and we had a munch
I promise on a dime it's the last time
I don't know what you must be on
So let me get my good shoes on
I wanna follow in the same old steps
Where you waltz around like you're the best
Where you garden blooms in May
But it snowing every day
The Houdini in my life
I could never be your wife
That falls for your lines
I know my words won't fail me
Please excuse my French
Sharing stories where you think you've been
Can't you see the twister that you're in
You're going solo in this dream
The Houdini in my life
I could never be your wife
That falls for your lines
I know my words won't fail me
Please excuse my French
I live deep in symmetry
I'll take hours to perfect
In this room of disconnect
All I need are mannequins and me
Fabric straight from arm to arm
Rescuing my heart from harm
All that I can see speaks of finesse
Costumed men and models scream
Fame is nothing more than force duress
Beauty has a price that's paid by greed
I don't need the money
Never will they mourn
I'd rather you not love me
Before you want too much
Every single last regret
To create and fill this emptiness
Freedom that lies underneath
Let it fall and let them breathe
Bodies are not meant to be so bound
I'm the dancer of the dance
Let the socialites in her hands
Let them love me when I'm not around
When they speak their words of my demeanor
I don't need the money
Never will they mourn
I'd rather you not love me
Before you want too much
Fading as I live in isolation
Information spreads that I have left
For them let it be an education
Those who cherish me will not let them forget
I don't need the money
Never will they mourn
I'd rather you not love me
He's like a whip that doesn't crack
You'll take a sip and you're on your back
Those big blue eyes are hard to reach
Like a guitar that cries for days
Seduces you in a thousand ways
It makes any girl we can out of sight
And the others know there's no defense
He creates an illusion that leads to confusion
And you give up your common sense
Well that's my two cents
He's like a wall that's made of steel
Too cold to touch but not much to feel
His silent smile he shares with you
Into thin air he disappears
Gives one last look and frozen leaf
Your heart for sure is good as gone
Love's a TV set that says it's nothing on
And the others know there's no defense
He creates an illusion that leads to confusion
And you give up your common sense
Well that's my two cents
There's no behind with the problems of a glint
All the coins dissipate when there are no fingerprints
Don't retrace your steps
If you spin the wheel you lose
And the others know there's no defense
He creates an illusion that leads to confusion
And you give up your common sense
Then I don't know why they call you
Your reflection is a ruse
Your heart refuses to tell you the truth
I can't believe that someone like you
Surrenders every element of you
May never seen the wonderful in you
Please forget his name
Your heart is desperately trying to find you
I can't believe that someone like you
Surrenders every element of you
May never seen the wonderful in you
It's just thunder that's leaving dark behind
I can't believe that someone like you
Surrenders every element of you
He kinda looks a little ordinary
A little work and I think that I could easily change his mind
I start to break him down
Tell me how long until you say you love me
Tell me how long until you say you're mine
I make it rain or shine
Tell me how long until you say you're mine
I really like the differences you bring when you arrive
You didn't tell your wife you're here and baby that's all right
But when you say you miss her
You really mean missing me
Tell me how long until you say you love me
Tell me how long until you say you're mine
I make it rain or shine
Tell me how long until you say you're mine
A one night affair could last longer if you dare
So hey be good and tell me are you scared
Well you keep looking at me over there
Tell me how long until you say you love me
Tell me how long until you say you're mine
I make it rain or shine
Let the air inside you
The ultimate impression
I'd never know her name
Course through my veins
Elevate your sense of pride
And face me at your leisure
To hear you hesitate and plea
Gives me a sense of pleasure
I'd never know her name
Course through my veins
Caught in a bad romance.
Caught in a bad romance.
Want your bad romance.
As long as it's free.
The touch of your hand.
All your lover's revenge.
Caught in a bad romance.
Caught in a bad romance.
Want your bad romance.
As long as you're mine
When your baby is sick.
All your lover's revenge.
Caught in a bad romance.
Caught in a bad romance.
And I want your revenge.
I don't wanna be friends.
I don't wanna be friends.
All your lover's revenge.
Caught in a bad romance.
Caught in a bad romance.
You're stranded in the desert
Ain't gonna be no rescue tonight
My telephone is ringing
Don't wanna hear your misery
When you act like a creep
Stay on the other side
In the universe of crazy lies
Don't send a messenger
My lights are on but nobody's home
You could smother it with money
All these definitions of ecstasy
Is how my fuse got lit
Stay on the other side
In the universe of crazy lies
Wave goodbye you're going down
Stay on the other side
In the universe of crazy lies
All the world is waiting for you
And the powers you possess
Fighting for your rights
Now the world is ready for you
And the wonders you can do
Get us out from under
All our hopes are pinned upon you
And the magic that you do
Spinning around in a busby swirl
I know at heart you want
Watch them do a few laps
But if you don't go in
I'll take you home with me
Your span of attention is shrinking fast
Your brain's been battered
Watch them do a few laps
But if you don't go in
I'll take you home with me
Walking on Main Street
Waiting by turnstiles
You thought you'd like to buy
Stored up in film cans
You looked up and saw
Watch them do a few laps
But if you don't go in
I'll take you home with me
Your toy balloon has sailed in the sky
But now it must fall to the ground
Now your sad eyes reveal
Just how badly you feel
The view from the cliffs must have been exciting
And up to the peaks you were bound
Now you're stranded alone
And the path is unknown
And there is no easy way down
When you're left on your own
When each road you take
And there's no one to break your fall
And lead you back home
Where our fantasy world can be found
But you must know in the end
When it's time to descend
There is no easy way down
You know you're gonna find
Although you see the world different than me
Sometimes I can touch upon the wonders that you see
And all the new colors and pictures you've designed
So glad you are a child of mine
You're the one who taught me you don't have to look behind
So glad you are a child of mine
Nobody's gonna kill your dreams or tell you how to live your life
There'll always be people who make it hard for a while
But you'll change their heads when they see you smile
The times you were born in may not have been the best
But you can make the times to come better than the rest
I know you will be honest if you can't always be kind
I think I'm going back
To the things I learned so well
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough
Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more electric trains
No more trees to climb
Thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out
A lot more than just my toys
Now there's much to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
A little bit of courage is all we lack
A little bit of courage is all we lack
Down the road a piece he was waiting
I had had my fill of hesitating
And I always knew it had to be
I never will forget our first encounter
And I was so glad that I had found him
As ready as I was that night
There are those of us too cool for passion
They're the ones that it could do some good
And there are those who say it's out of fashion
They're the ones who only wish they could
I'm gonna stay right here with you
All you have to do is choose
Yes it shows you need a change
Things that made you feel so good before
And all you'd have to do is try something new
It's time you stepped back out in the sunshine
Wouldn't you like to wake up and find
Me every morning on your mind
Was a time I remember
Hope flashed and went dim
When assassins just happened
To do the right people in
And love was a slogan
And they told us they'd work it out
In the swing of changing times
A man cried out for his
And every politician said
He was telling us like it is
And they told us they'd work it out
I see the choking cities
I see them tearing up this earth
That their lives have little worth
And I know that the future
Depends on you and me
I hope we can work it out
I hope we can work it out
Laid out on the breakfast table
It's time to begin again
Way down in the valley
Where the rivers flow
Lives a girl named Sally
Who loves to watch things grow
Laid out on the breakfast table
It's time to begin again
Now Sally has five children
And they all sit down together
Laid out on the breakfast table
It's time to begin again
Long ago we had our dreams
And that was all that we needed
Then all at once we got to see
The cycles we repeated
Anyone can look into your eyes
It's been told to you many times before
But you refuse to listen
I can't hear you no more
I've heard it all before
I can't hear you no more
I can't hear you no more
And I can't take no more of your jive
I ain't about to let you
Run me into the ground
I'm not gonna throw away my youth
I can't hear you no more
I can't hear you no more
I can't hear you no more
I can't hear you no more
I can't hear you no more
You gotta speak out louder
You gotta speak out louder
I can't hear you no more
Just a little bit louder
Just a little bit louder
Just a little bit louder
Just a little bit louder
You're a sweet sweetheart
You've been a real good friend
You're around when I'm down
To my faults you're blind
You overlook the bad and
You keep all the good in mind
Now there have been times
When we couldn't get on
But you just closed your mind
To all the seeds of doubt
And somehow you found a way
To make it all work out
Now when you come home
At the close of the day
That sends message my way
What this message means
Any old fool could see
And the thing that make me feel so well
When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space
On the roof it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below can't bother me
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I get away from the hustling crowds
And all that rat race noise down in the street
On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
At night the stars put on a show for free
Right smack dab in the middle of town
So if this world starts getting you down
I feel the earth move under my feet
Whenever you're around
Mellow as the month of May
I feel the earth move under my feet
Whenever you're around
And you tenderly call my name
I know that my emotions
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're just time away
Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again could only do me good
Can't say much of anything that's new
If I could only work this life out my way
But you're so far away
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're so far away
I sure do hope the road don't come to own me
There's so many dreams I've yet to find
But you're so far away
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't help to know you're so far away
Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
There'll be good times again for me and you
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
Sometimes I wonder if I'm ever gonna make it home again
It's so far and out of sight
I really need someone to talk to and nobody else
Knows how to comfort me tonight
Chills my soul right to the marrow
Chills my soul right to the marrow
You've got to get up every morning
With a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
That you're beautiful as you feel
I've got nothing to do but watch the passersby
Mirrored in their faces I see frustration growing
You've got to get up every morning
With a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
That you're beautiful as you feel
I have often asked myself for reason for sadness
In a world where tears are just a lullaby
You've got to get up every morning
With a smile in your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
Is a place that I know
Where I can find shelter
From a hunger and cold
That's where I'm bound
I know when I get there
The first thing I'll see
Is the sun shining golden
Shining right down on me
Then trouble's gonna lose me
Worry leave me behind
And I'll stand up proudly
In true peace of mind
Is a place I have seen
In a garden of wisdom
From some long ago dream
To the land where the honey runs
That's where I'm bound
When you're down and troubled
And you need some love and care
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Now ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
And take your soul if you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Wanting you the way I do
I only wanna be with you
And I would go to the ends of the earth
Cause darling to me that's what you're worth
If you're out on the road
Feeling lonely and so cold
All you have to do is call my name
I always wanted a real home
With flowers on the windowsill
But if you wanna live in New York City
I never thought I could get satisfaction
But if anyone could keep me happy
You're the one who can
I'm gonna follow where you lead
I'm gonna follow where you lead
I'm gonna follow where you lead
I'm gonna follow where you lead
Of love is in your eyes
You say that I'm the only one
And I won't ask again
For a little confrontation.
He didn't think about the noose.
He couldn't take no more abuse
So he shot down the congregation.
You can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand.
Stood for law and order.
He called for the guard to come
And surround the border.
To clean up the streets
You can't talk to a man
When he don't wanna understand.
The account of the capture
With a shotgun in his hand.
A shotgun in his hand.
My life has been a tapestry
An everlasting vision
Once amid the soft silver
A drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth
Around his leathered hide
He moved with some uncertainty
Just what he was there for
Or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something
Golden hanging from a tree
He sat down on a river rock
And turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen
Into someone's wicked spell
Though I didn't know him well.
There suddenly appeared
A figure gray and ghostly
Beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness
I've seen him dressed in black.
He's come to take me back.
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
But your love was the key to my peace of mind
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm living for
Close to you you make me feel so alive
You know you make me feel
I thought what he didn't know
Wouldn't hurt him anyway.
Someone else gave him her hand to hold.
And suddenly I find myself out in the cold.
He trusted me all the time.
I thought I could see another man
And he would still be mine.
Well yesterday I had a good thing
Worth more than gold.
Today he's got a truer love and I'm out in the cold.
I had a love warmer than fire.
But I listened to my desire.
If you open up a new door
You may find the old one's closed.
So be true to your good man
Take a lesson from this story I have told.
Or you just might get left now
You just might get left now
Don't let yourself get left now
Don't let yourself get left now
For a little confrontation.
He didn't think about the noose.
He couldn't take no more abuse
So he shot down the congregation.
You can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand.

And surround the border.
To clean up the streets
You can't talk to a man
When he don't wanna understand.
The account of the capture

A shotgun in his hand.
But I love you like no other
I've been watching everything you do
And I've been wishing only good for you
All you've got to do is just want it to
But I love you like no other
You have always been so good to me
And though you didn't always talk to me
And I don't believe you need
You know I love you like no other
It's going to take some time this time
To get myself in shape.
I really missed the gate.
And I'll find some harmony.
And I can't make demands.
I'll learn how to bend.
And it's going to take some time this time.
No matter what I've planned.
I'll learn how to bend.
And I'm on the road again
And sometimes the blues get a hold of you
All around the block people will talk
But I want to give it all that I got
Sure does appeal to me
You know we can get there easily
Just like a sailboat sailing on the sea
And most times you choose between the two
But I'll have some kids and make my plans
And I'll watch the seasons running away
Sure does appeal to me
You know we can get there easily
All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
Anytime my little world is blue
I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be
Some kind of wonderful
I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness
Is so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
Surely you know how I stand on the question of my loving you
Surely you can tell by the way I kiss your lips that I want you
More surely than my words can say
Misunderstanding what others have seen
Surely you won't let idle people with nothing else to rely on
Tear down all our hopes and our dreams
Just as surely as the sun is gonna rise
Just as surely as the birds are gonna sing
Just as surely as everything is part of everything
Surely you know I'm a part of you
And surely you know that I love you
As long as you've got to travel
First time out is a heavy feeling
White clouds under my feet
Sailing along like a south wind
Of peace and love and war
I still don't have an answers
But I don't get high anymore
As long as you've got to travel
And some folks gotta be still
Don't let it get you there's joy in either
So don't what you will
Just you and me and easy
As long as you've got to travel
Music is playing inside my head
Over and over and over again
But the music keeps playing
And won't let the cold get me down.
Pictures are forming inside my brain
Soon with the colors they'll rain together and grow
But the music keeps playing
And won't let the world get me down.
Music is playing inside
Music is playing inside
Music is playing inside
Whispering wind came uninvited
Looking for somewhere else to go
Here is a lamp I've left unlighted
Memory's flame is soon ignited
Lighting my lamp with amber glow
Quietly friends are reunited
Who just can't be happy
And be glad you can feel enough to cry
Bringing me brand new seeds to sow
Now that they've been a long time planted
If it had been as I intended
I wouldn't have the peace I know
Loving the people I've befriended
Singing a song of long ago
Loving the people I've befriended
We've been knowing each other
And I can't think of anyone else
Can make me feel as good as you
A little bit brighter in every way
I'm so glad to have you
In this old troubled time
A little bit brighter every day
Their whole life through
I just know that I'd have been one of them
If it hadn't been for you
But I think of the loving good times we've had
And I know we're gonna make it through
Cause you make my day
You've been my life to me
My very soul and my heart
And it's tearing me apart
More and more each day
Whatever you want me to be I'll be
If it keeps you from growing away from me
The feeling's no longer there
I know there's somebody else
And it's more than I can bear
But I don't know if it's worse thing being lonely
Than having you here in body only
It's no use pretending
When the love you used to feel is gone
Yet even though I'm losing you
By Carole King and Toni Stern
If anyone asks you how I am
If you will do that for me
I'll do the same for you sometime
Just say I'm down the line
I don't want my friends to see me like this
Maybe some other time
There's just been too much rain down on me
One day I'm gonna understand
The way that my heart works
And then I'm gonna work it out
But if anyone asks you where I've gone
I'd rather be in traction
Than to be here where I am
Oh you Georgia red clay
I've got to make it home somehow
Before I lose my mind
I've been on the road too long
And let me be where I belong
Been down by the railroad track
I know that you can be a sweet city
But I won't soon be back
My own house on high ground
By Carole King and Toni Stern
I'm all right in the sunshine
But the evenings let me down
It sure is good to see you now
I'm really glad you came
And I would tell you what I need
But it never feels the same
Let it come down slow
I've been alone so long
That I just don't know what to do
And I don't want to lose you
How my life slips away
And I know I belong here
Riding along with a friend of mine
Pieces of fruit and glasses of wine
And love comes in the summertime
And I don't want to lose you
God bless the children
We are the children of Paradise
On our own now since the fall
All the things that are worth having
Are never ours to keep
Still I can see today could be
A good time for you and me
By Carole King and Toni Stern
All he wants to do is dance.
While moving in a little closer
Moving in on the girl he hardly knows
Looking out my window
Peace in the valley just don't come
Though I know that man's my brother
The hour is getting later
It's time we had begun
But the race must still be run
Take care of little jealousies
And talk that kills for fun
And hold your heart in readiness
It's so easy to come undone
But I think I saw a brand new light
Coming over the horizon
Brighter than all the others
And it says all men are brothers under the skin
Brothers under the skin
Looking out my window
Peace in the valley just don't come
And that I'm the selfish one
And I look at other people
And I love the ones I can
Still I think I saw a brand new light
Coming over the horizon
Brighter than all the others
And it says all men are brothers under the skin
Brothers under the skin
By Carole King and Toni Stern
And we'll find some other place to go
Let's turn all our cares down low.
It's like a trip back to the past
Running down the bright night
Sitting on a barstool
Always feeling half right and half safe
Halfway dreaming of some safe place
And we'll find some other place to go
Let's turn all our cares down low.
To touch each other softly
And so make up our loss
Some things take so long to learn
Still we try and keep it open
And we'll find some other place to go
On the first day in August
I want to wake up by your side
After sleeping with you
On the last night in July
We'll catch the sun rising
And we'll chase it from the mountains
To the bottom of the sea
And we'll watch the flames dancing
With your arm around my shoulder
And nothing will come between us
On the first night In August
Bitter with the sweet
About being someplace at some time
You've got to take the bitter with the sweet
You think you're not having fun
And you wonder what you're doing
Playing the games you play
You've got to take the bitter with the sweet
A friend of mine once told me
He said everything good in life
You've got to pay for
Though it seems the blues will never end
And I can tell you that it's true
It's a feeling that can't be beat
And you've got to do it
Goodbye don't mean I'm gone
Don't it seem like the time goes on
And here we are still carrying on
Reaching out for one another
Like a telephone call
From an old friend or a brother
And you are there to share this
Goodbye don't mean I'm gone
I know how alone you are
When it's so hard to be so far
From the ones who mean the most to you
Have them close to you
I hope you know you haven't been forsaken
Goodbye don't mean I'm gone
I'll never be what you think you see in me
If I can help you deal with what you see as real
That makes me glad to have known you
Missing you the way I do
You know I'd like to see more of you
But it's all I can do to be a mother
I've a pen in the other
You know my love is always there for the taking
I was wanting someone to talk to
Needing to let myself out
Knowing beyond a doubt the past is behind me
There was nowhere but here to walk to
Letting the time go by
Trying to see if I could ever find me.
It didn't seem to make much sense
Thinking about the dent I'd made
Should I create today
Now needing a hand to cling to
Showing me where to find me
Gotta get through another day
A strange and moody blues day
Corn yellow silk and golden sunlight I remember
Love like a sweet flaming glow inside
And I've cried till I can't remember why
It's a strange and moody blues day anyway
Some say that time brings a better understanding
Still the flame keeps burning through the lonely night
It's just not all right
A strange and moody blues day
I think I can hear you
Is it true what I do is the way to be near you
At the way you can keep this old world running smoothly
Thinking of you always seems to soothe me
Or a time or a season
But I'm here and life is dear
And I guess that's a good enough reason to say
Just let me do what you put me here to
Let me be what you want me to be
And I hope it'll cheer you
I'm listening and I think I can hear you
Even when I thought I didn't believe
And everyone is a part of you
And anyone can know you
All they've got to do is be
I'm gonna head on up to the old Ferguson Road
Stand beneath the trees and see how tall I am
So I will be sure not to give a damn
No one ever loses anybody
I don't want to hang on to anybody
I'm gonna head on up to the old Ferguson Road
Find myself a spot where the sun shines through
I'll throw some old mattress in the back of my bus
And get a good head start on forgetting you
You know I've never known anybody
Who could ever make me feel this way
But no one gets to own anybody
I'm gonna head on up to the old Ferguson Road
Stand beneath the trees and see how tall I am
Green fields and rolling hills
Room enough to do what we will
Are running though my mind
Of a place I left behind
I've been to Canaan and I wanna go back again
Though I'm content with myself
Sometimes I long to be somewhere else
I try to do what I can
But with our day to day demands
We all need a promised land
And it's been so long
I can't remember when
I've been to Canaan and I wanna go back again
With a fireplace burning to warm me
But I've been to Canaan and I wanna go back again
Looking for a way to say
The things I think about day by day
Listen to their meaning if you can
I may step outside myself
And speak as if I were someone else
That's one way I know you'll understand
In fantasy I can be black or white
You say this is a time to right old wrongs
How long are you gonna wait to do what you want to do now
You've been around too long
Not to notice what's going on in town
You've got to understand
I'm taking my life in my own hands
If you really want to do right by me
See what you want to see
But let me be what I want to be
Not to realize what's going on inside
Being at war with each other
So why do we complicate our lives so much
By being at war with each other
Why do we seem to vote to dig more holes
It's such a waste of a planet
There must be a reason that I can't see
Maybe somebody else knows better than me
Everyone else is a sister or brother
So we've got to look around again and stop
When I've got my life on my mind
But they can't do a thing about it till tomorrow
Now I don't want a lot of your time
After how many tears I've cried
How much longer must I try
Directions presenting themselves every day
Stealing somebody else's pride
How much longer must I cry
I can see all the things of which I've dreamed
Of all I have wanted so long
That's how things go down
Carrying the child of our sweet love
That's how things go down
But I want to see you again
Others in life who've made it on their own
That's how things go down
But I want to see you again
I pray that I will see you soon
And you will be here with me
To see the child being born
All I can do is wait and hope that you'll
That's how things go down
I want to see you again
All I can do is wait and hope that you'll
That's how things go down
I want to see you again
That's how things go down
Coffee smell in the air
After you've gone and the children have left for school
I'm alone and I think about all the plans we made
I think about all the dreams I had
And I wonder if I'm a fool
I've got the marketing done
Plenty to do but nothing to tax my mind
Heaven knows I can always watch the daytime shows
And I wonder which story's mine
She loved a man she knew little about
After so many years of trying
So many years of doing without
I've been with you and you need me to take care of you
And we'll help each other out the best that we can
Haven't you had enough of the stuff
How mama stayed awake all night
The night they brought him in
She cried and said she always knew he was up to no good
It broke her heart the night he died
And she made me promise I'd stand by your side
And try to protect you from the evil in the neighborhood
What makes you think that you'll be the one to put it down
She's always been so good to you and you've never let her down
What about the life you planned
I know it's hard to shake it
But you got to be a man and take it
I know this is no way to make it
It's not too late for you
All I want is a quiet place to live
Where I can enjoy the fruits of my labor
And not have to cry out loud
In my mind I can see it crystal clear
Sharing my dreams with the people around me
And I'm just a part of the crowd
What will become of us
What about the children
What will they do to us next time around
What will the answer be
What will it mean to me
When are they gonna see we're underground
And all I want is a quiet place to live
Where I can be free in a world of my making
What they decided to give
Was she really someone's wife
She often cried as they left her without a shred of pride
She had so many things to think about
So many children to feed
She had need of something that would ease her mind
She had trouble in her time
You light up my life like sunrise in the morning
You make me believe anything is possible
I didn't have a dream to my name
But you came to light up my life
You brought me faith and hope and love and light
With your tender smile you brought me to the promise
I didn't know how rich I could be
Until you gave your love to me
You give me faith and hope and love and light
You brought your sweet understanding
Like sun rays in my hazy skies
If you hadn't opened up my eyes
I never knew how good I could feel
If you read the papers you may see
History in the making
You'll read what they say life is all about
They say it's there for the taking
If you want to know what's shaking
But don't tell me about the things you've heard
We have been unkind to one another
Tell me how many times has the golden rule
Been applied by man to his brother
I believe if I really looked at what's going on
I would lose faith I never could recover
So don't tell me about the things you've heard
Maybe I'm living with my head in the sand.
I just want to see people giving.
I want to believe in my fellow man.
He seeks that sheltered nest
Like the sailor's lost horizon
He needs some place to rest
The songs that he's been singing
No longer make much sense
They've killed his confidence
She sails away upon a sea of song
When his tired voice is broken
His golden hope is gone
She makes a lost soul's simple longing
He was strong but he was taken
By the thought of his success
Those spotlight shadows how they lured him
And took him like all the rest
But that old dream don't look good now
No it don't seem quite the same
He needs to hear a tender word
Won't you sing him home again
She sails away upon a sea of songs
When his strength is slowly going
His pride is all but gone
She makes a foolish dreamer listen
By Carole King and David Palmer
We ought to try to face the fact
The things we thought had value
They've all been taken back
We've been losing track of time
But time's no easy mark
I can see you've got a change in mind
But what we need is a change of heart
I can see you've got a change in mind
But what we need is a change of heart
It seems that we've been holding out
The things that once held meaning
We're no longer sure about
We've been moving down the line
Losing what time we've got
And since you say you've had a change in mind
Why don't you try a little change of heart
I can see you've got a change in mind
But what we need is a change of heart
Now I'm not asking anymore of you
It's the only way we grow
Let me tell you I just don't know
Seems to me that we could find some
He can sing you into paradise or bring you to your knees.
A song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified.
The same as yours with every change you play.
It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul.
He can fill a room with sadness as he fills his horn with tears.
The same as yours with every change you play.
By Carole King and David Palmer
You've put these distances between us
While making love seem so unkind
I'll get over you in time
There's nothing here to hold you now
I've tried to justify your thinking
I've given in and been denied
The only thing you leave is compromise
I'll get over you in time
There's nothing here to hold you now
We left those dreams so far behind
I feel so damn defeated when we're through
I'll get over you in time
There's nothing here to hold you now
I just can't fight your willful mind
By Carole King and David Palmer
When I left the world behind me
Retreating through the past
You reached out to find me
You've shown me something
Beyond my looking glass
You're the light of creation
That I'd come to love you
Life seemed oh so temporary
And I survived just barely
But now each day I'm given
Is one more day I know
A love that's so unselfish
It's a pleasure just to show my love to you
We are all in this together
By Carole King and David Palmer
The just are seeking justice
The meek are reaching out
For something only children
Can really know about
And some men cry for mercy
And some men laugh for reasons
They can never quite explain
We are all in this together
And maybe we'll see that one day
When we conquer our fear together
When we finally find a way
And we all need forgiving
For all the damage done
For the hurt that we've caused someone
The reason and the meaning
The vision and the dream
We are all in this together
I know that seems easy to say
By Carole King and David Palmer
I know my daddy's with me right to the end
I believe in salvation.
I don't doubt what I've found
My baby calls me late Friday night
He sounds so crazy but he feels so right
I've been coming unwound
By Carole King and David Palmer
When tempers flare to flame
When no one cares to listen
You see the anger rise in me
And the feeling that remains grows
When you gentle to me
When rumor comes to call
Suspicion's taking over
And I'm back against the wall
You just smile assuringly
When you're gentle to me
When tension's taking shape
When I feel the pressure building and
It's just too much to take
You touch the anxious need in me
By Carole King and David Palmer
It's hard enough to hear you
Express your sympathy
But it's harder still to feel the things
My eyes refuse to see
You bring these tears into
I watch you take my self respect
Accepting each excuse
When I've never seen the reason
For your moods or abuse
They hold you like the heaven holds the sun
But look what you've done to
Like a man whose way is righteous
His faith in life resigned
I'm a child whose eyes are sightless
And my faith in you is truly blind
It's sad to think of living
As pain that we must feel
But it's sadder still to think of love
As something you conceal
You bring these tears into
Waiting on tables while waiting on fame
When every day's survival is one more night
I'm glad to see you made it through your contests once again
You heart needs time to mend
I'm glad to see you made it up that hard
Your highway's found an end
A night this side of dying
By Carole King and David Palmer
I remember one young sister with rainbows in her eyes
Standing on the corner with the afternoon's supply
Then she asked if I could tell her where they
Like a night this side of dying
Her day's inside the dropper on the shelf
When she hears her lifeline crying
Not a thing you say can stop her
When she just can't stop herself
The best of friends sold brothers for a
Dime of quinine dreams
Like a night this side of dying
Her day's inside the dropper on the shelf
Like the shelter she's been buying
Not a thing I've got can save her
When she just can't save herself
The best is yet to come
By Carole King and Dave Palmer
But we've seen the seasons turning
As we weathered every storm
And the climate of our loving
Is so tender and so warm
And the best is yet to come
This is only the beginning
And we've only just begun
But when the flood of sudden tears came down
We smiled and stood our ground
And the laughter we'd been counting on
It finally came around
And the best is yet to come
And it's getting so much better
You better believe me
Tea for Two and Two for Tea
1 was Johnny who lived by himself
2 was a rat who jumped on his shelf
3 was a cat who chased the rat
4 was a dog who came in and sat
5 was a turtle who bit the dog's tail
6 was a monkey who brought in the mail
7 a blackbird pecked poor Johnny's nose
8 was a tiger out selling old clothes
9 was a robber who took an old shoe
And when I am through
9 was the robber who left looking pale
8 was the tiger who chased him to jail
7 was the blackbird flew off to Havana
6 was the monkey who stole the banana
5 was the turtle who crawled off to bed
4 was the dog who slid home on a sled
3 was the cat who pounced on the rat
2 was the rat who left with the cat
1 was Johnny who lived by himself
There was once a boy named Pierre
At the end that a suitable
One day his mother said
When Pierre climbed out of bed
So his mother left him there
So his parents left him there
They didn't take him anywhere
Now as the night began to fall
A hungry lion paid a call
He looked Pierre right in the eye
And asked him if he'd like to die
So the lion ate Pierre
Arriving home at six o'clock
They found the lion sick in bed and cried
They pulled the lion by the hair
They hit him with the folding chair
They rushed the lion into town
The doctor shook him up and down
And when the lion gave a roar
Pierre fell out upon the floor
He rubbed his eyes and scratched his head
And laughed because he wasn't dead
His mother cried and held him tight
Then everyone looked at Pierre
The lion took them home to rest
And stayed on as a weekend guest
When everybody screams and yells
To make them see it my way
To turn twelve boring hours
Stop screaming and yelling
Screaming and yelling
Screaming and yelling
Screaming and yelling
Today our dear friend
This very ordinary day
And swallowed it away
Now listen to what I'm gonna say
And fell down croaking
From choking on a bone
On such an ordinary day
In January it's so nice
While slipping on the sliding ice
To sip hot chicken soup with rice
Sipping chicken soup with rice
In February it will be
My snowman's anniversary
Happy chicken soup with rice
In March the wind blows down the door
And spills my soup upon the floor
It laps it up and roars for more
Blowing chicken soup with rice
In April I will go away
To far off Spain or old Bombay
And dream about hot soup all day
In May I truly think it best
To be a robin lightly dressed
Concocting soup inside my nest
Mix that chicken soup with rice
In June I saw a charming group
Of roses all begin to droop
Sprinkle chicken soup with rice
In July I'll take a peep
Into the cool and fishy deep
Where chicken soup is selling cheap
Selling chicken soup with rice
In August it will be so hot
I will become a cooking pot
Cooking chicken soup with rice
Paddle chicken soup with rice
In October I'll be host
I'll serve them chicken soup on toast
Spouting chicken soup with rice
In December I will be
With soup bowls draped all over me
Merry chicken soup with rice
All seasons of the year are nice
For eating chicken soup with rice
Avenue P as it ought to be
In this fabulous movie you're all gonna see
An entirely different Avenue P
Imagine me in a jungle gown
And Avenue P a jungle town
With King Kong swinging out of a tree
You don't have to sit with your face in a droop on the stoop
The jungle creeps over the red brick houses
Avenue P as it ought to be
I'll make it that way someday
Avenue P as it ought to be
Avenue P as it ought to be
Avenue P as it ought to be
Avenue P as it ought to be
Avenue P as it ought to be
Here's where it all began
Here's where I heard that beat
Here's where I tapped that tap
With my natural rhythm feet
In my simple humble neighborhood
On my simple humble street
Here's where the dreams I had
Were crowded on a stoop
Were pecked and pushed and hustled
Just like chickens in a coop
Life wasn't always neat
In my simple humble neighborhood
On my simple humble street
Here's where I learned the rules
That changed the same
In my simple humble neighborhood
On my simple humble street
Here's where I made up folks
Not just ordinary folks
To make them green with envy
In my simple humble neighborhood
On my simple humble street
Here's where it all began
Here's where I heard that tune
Here's where I sang of sailing
In a carnival balloon
Life was so darn sweet
In my simple humble neighborhood
The challenge is tough
But I know I've got the stuff
To be just spectacular
Can't you see it in lights
Loving a guy who's mostly dead
Nothing could be zanier
Than our lives in Transylvania
We're fabulous one day
At six in the morning
When my sweetie is yawning
Cover all the trap doors
And wash any old blood stains
I got the bloodshot eyes
It's the dream of my life
The reviews will all rave
This movie's a whopper
And no one can top her
I should get the Oscar vote
There's got to be more to being so great
I've really learned the hard way
That pastas and cakes
And French fries and steaks
Are not such great shakes
That castles in Spain
Can't wonders like me
For just a mere plateful
And believe it or not
You better believe me
Tea for Two and Two for Tea
So many ways to show you love someone
So many ways to show someone you care
We have so much in common
When you reach out and touch my hand
Without a word you say I love you
So many ways to show you love someone
So many ways to show someone you care
Since I've been spending all my time with you
You've taught me something new every day
And I just want to say
The music comes from you and me
And it's plain to see that we both know
So many ways to show you love someone
You're a welcome sight
Seeing you just lifts me out of the cold
And you never fail to make my day
You smile and all the sadness leaves my heart
It's an easy course for sailing that you chart
But it's only temporary
And you know I'd never ask you to stay
Riding on the beach at sunset
Dreaming of the world that waits for you
That's where my mind's eye sees you
In a world that frees you
To do anything that you want to do
Though you can only be a sometime friend
You restore my faith in love again
And that's not temporary
Even though you go away
I wish the years away
And you look into mine
All my sorrows disappear
When I'm high out of time
Is a place I like to be
And you're a part of me
And I can hold you near
When I'm high out of time
No use wondering where the years have gone
But every now and then I look up an old friend
And come home to someplace I used to belong
The world becomes so new
Horizons That we've crossed
I cross again with you
Traveling through the years
Feeling the warmth as the flames grow higher
I think it's true that nothing
Is really new under the sun
Watching a new love grow
From old love's embers
Yesterday's gone but today remembers
Doesn't it seem to come down the same for everyone
Everything else illusion
Adding to the confusion of the way we connive
Tracing a line till we can define
The thing that allows us to feel
Childhood dreams like muddy waters
Flowing through me to my son and daughters
Everything I ever thought is confirmed as truth to me
Even as I see the way that I want to go now
Still I had wished I had known what I know now
Maybe I could have spared you
Giving your youth to me
Everything else illusion
Adding to the confusion of the way we connive
Tracing a line till we can define
The thing that allows us to feel
There's a space between us
You've been there for me
But now I feel a boundary has been drawn
I can see from all you do
That you still care for me
I know the feeling hasn't gone
But there's a space between us
A place that I can't go
Unless you step across and meet me halfway
We've been friends for much too long
And the feeling's much too strong
Reach out and make the space between us go away
I know a little bit of space between two friends
But once in a while we need to touch
The way that people should
Cause you know I've been there
But I've been working on a way to love
And still be free to care
And I know just what you're thinking
Was a time I used to be just where you are
But since I've found my freedom
And I've finally let it sink in
The distance isn't very far
There's a space between us
A place that I can't go
Unless you step across and meet me halfway
We've been friends for much too long
And the feeling's much too strong
Reach out and make the space between us go away
I'd like to know you better
I'd like to know you better
There's so much about you I can see
There's a love as good as gold in you
I can feel it when I'm holding you
I'd like to know you better
Being with you feel so good to me
In a world of distraught humanity
You have brought me to my sanity
We seem to get along so well
Whether or not we'll stay that way
It's much to early to tell
But I'd like to know you better
Meeting you has been so good for me
And if only temporarily
We all have to be alone
Once I told you without feeling
When you came to me in sorrow
There's a truth that life's revealing
We all have to be alone
Tell you she'd be there tomorrow
But instead I only told you
We all have to be alone
Then I was amazed to see
How quickly you agreed with me
If that's the way it has to be
There's nothing left to say
No reason left to stay
Besides I've got a lot of better things
So my world grew so much colder
With a little love to lend or borrow
And I found out as I grew older
By Carole King and David Palmer
In the fields of sweet Ambrosia I've been told
You can sit down by the river
And watch yourself unfold
You can drink right from the river
Let my senses know your power
Let your holy mix distill
Who need pain to feel alive
But now I'm kind of like a child
Who's been slowly reconciled
To waiting on the wisdom that
He knows will soon arrive
In the hills above Ambrosia I have seen
A lovely place of mystery with
Meadows emerald green
And the colors of Ambrosia
Are as real as any dream
Still here thinking of you
I have tried to untangled
To know the one I loved the best
To dream of happiness and make that
And I'm still here thinking of you
Yes I'm still here thinking of you
The city streets are colder
And I'm just a little bit older
My love has grown somehow
I can feel it now much more
And I'm still here thinking of you
Yes I'm still here thinking of you
This road keeps winding
And I wake up finding
Somehow I've lost my way again
Someway I'd like to get through
The road that's straight beyond the bend
I have tried to unravel
The paths we've both had to travel
And now that I have come to see
How much you meant to me
We might get to see a better view
Still here thinking of you
I'm still here thinking of you
It's gonna work out fine
We've been putting each other
And it's a mighty good feeling to
Know we're gonna work it out
Take a look at the way it's going now
Makes you want to give a sigh of relief
You know the last thing I ever
I guess it was a situation
That was bound to come up someday
But our feeling for each other won out
And I'm oh so glad to say
Even the best of relationships
Run the risk of going awry
There's a lot two people who care
Can do to make each other cry
Ain't it funny how it took a reunion
To help us to really see
Simple things mean a lot to me
Some things only children can see
Simple things like horses running free
And easy acceptance of life
Simple things never compromise
All things have a rhythm I can't realize
I feel content in my freedom
And I feel my freedom is right
I never want to stop being a child
I want to see the flowers growing wild on the hillside
To see the sun rise in the morning
Simple things of the earth don't die
They just grow and change as time goes by
There are no questions without answers
I've found my answer to life is living
Heavy chains have been broken
The old ones have spoken
Old young friend of ours
It won't be long until we can touch the stars
Flows into our hearts and makes us feel all right
Hold on until we can get there
You know when we get there
All the dark forces will be gone
We need each other now more than ever
It's a shame that one such as you
Should have to walk this cold and lonely night
Hold on until we can get there
You know when we get there
Do the things you believe in
And know that you aren't alone
We all have doubts and fears
Know throughout every season
You are the name of love
And you'll keep on feeling at home
Throughout the coming years
Change is for certain
Each day opening the curtain
Through your sorrow and grieving
Don't forget the name of love
It goes on without any end
Birth and life and death make a circle
To see the light ever lasting
Live in the name of love
Of mind games and power plays
Or are we gonna take the chance of a lifetime
To see the light of day
Of rainbows and butterflies
I keep believing if we all work together
We will surely find a way
We are lost in a labyrinth
There's only one thing to do
Just break down the walls
And reach out your hand to your brother
We can lead each other
To where destiny calls
After a while we will see
The labyrinth isn't anyplace we need to be
Then we can come out from the heart of the darkness
One of these days we will know
The heart will take us anywhere we want to go
I only hope it's not too late for the purpose
We are lost in a labyrinth
There's only one thing to do
Just know in your mind
You want to stand behind your brother
Reach out and lead each other
Crystal mourners are drawing me to Babylon
Can you really stay yourself and flow with dedication
You're the one who knows and now you're gone
We got a feeling and I'm gonna try to keep it for a long time
Can you hold the love I gave in joyful consummation
You're the one who knows and now you're gone
Can you see my reflection in the facets of the prisms that you gave me
I'll be yours forever in the secret magic forest
That we dreamed about together
Can you see the color that I am today
I know I wanna stay in a good way
Waking up alone I find my mind is calling out
And I know you feel me
You know the real me is whatever color love takes on
Can you live with someone who's a mistress of illusion
Downtown anywhere in the USA
Put your money on a number anyone can play
Come on and tell us all about what happened to you today
After a hard day's work I guarantee
There just isn't anywhere better to be
If you're unable to find good company
You can always sit down and watch the color TV
And if you're feeling just a little bit lonely
Don't sit at home just hoping
Come on down to where the spirits flow so free
You know that door is always open
Here we are in time alone
No one else's feelings but our own
Seems to me that we have always known
What love was meant to be
Separately we stood before
Life was good but we knew there should
Time alone could open up the door
And you came through for me
No sign of the changes we have come through
No mind of the strangers who think they
Now as one we are the a light
Though sometimes we were blinded by the night
Here in time alone it all seems right
And I'm feeling wholly free
Sometimes I feel like
If we're gonna get what we need
Keeping your mind in an amber haze
But there's so much between you
And the natural land up on which you were raised
It's easy to turn your head
And not think about when it all comes down
If you're gonna be around
Maybe it's not for me to understand
Maybe destruction is part of the plan
Maybe I'll never get there
It sure makes me angry
To realize that I'm caught in a game
I used to love everybody
Now it's so hard to do through this pain
If I'll ever be the same
The winds of time set my mind at ease
With each new morning it's a good feeling to know
There is something to look forward to these days
Even now as we go our separate ways
Like the sun and the moon we give each other room
To shine and to glow and to grow and I know that I love you
Poetic phrases come to mind
Whenever I find injustice being done
What can one do except to be one
Growing to four million
I go through phases when I realize
It wouldn't be wise to try and bring it down
What should one do except just be around
Growing to five billion
Open your heart and let the love come shining through
And you will do what you need to do
To know just where the other you is coming from
It just amazes me that I can be
Part of the energy it takes to serve each other
And I wonder what am I gonna do
Simple things mean a lot to me
Some things only children can see
Simple things like horses running free
And easy acceptance of life
Simple things never compromise
All things have a rhythm I can't realize
I feel content in my freedom
And I feel my freedom is right
I never want to stop being a child
I want to see the flowers growing wild on the hillside
To see the sun rise in the morning
Simple things of the earth don't die
They just grow and change as time goes by
There are no questions without answers
I've found my answer to life is living
Look at them fancy wheels
The Great American Pastime
Is still the automobile
Is the only way to make time
On Main Street Saturday night
But all of them will get down
If the right thing comes around
Here comes Little Willie
If Willie's got a line on
It's got to be dynamite
You know you can trust him
You know the way to be
Going through to the second sea
The music inside us all
Fulfilled in its own existence
And let the time of spring to fall not be a distance
Brings on another day
I'm no older now than yesterday
Somebody touched my hand and said
I was a woman of taste
Then with a flutter of wings
Amid the clutter of things
I saw the Venusian Diamond through a sea of grace
And I will be your own
Then there appeared a serpent hanging
And fell into the wrong end of a telescope
I knew not to where I'd come
I could hear the Venusian Diamond and it
And I will be your own
With my limited vision
Why anybody has to lose a friend
Everybody has to follow their heart
But it can hurt so bad
I believed in something
I thought you did too
But I didn't know what you were going through
There's no wrong or right
Once I experienced the other end
I lost a friend or two
Doing what was true for me
Even though I know that time will make it right
I miss the way things used to be
All the reasons why people come and go
I guess if we can love it all transcends
There's enough to give
We've got our lives to live
Sometimes I feel like I've been living much too long
And I've wasted too much time
I think I've lost the inner harmony that flows through me
Like the shoreline that divides the sea and sand
I'm a surface ever changing
I get burdened by the things I just don't understand
And all the mountains left to climb
But then the morning sun comes shining through my window
And it's good to be alive
It's gonna be a golden day
If I can only learn the lesson of the seasons
Of a balance rearranging
Though they may not always come just when I want them to
Still they come and keep me high
And the morning sun comes shining through my window
And it's good to be alive
It's gonna be a golden day
If you want to get a real education
Come to the friendliest school in the nation
Rhythm is our way of communication
You won't ever want to take a vacation
He's gonna get down and boogie with you
Let me be your teacher
Why don't you take home a diploma from
We won't give you pomp and circumstance
All you're gonna need to do is dance
You might even find a new romance
Everybody here is graded A
The only school records are the ones we play
Let me be your teacher
Why don't you take home a diploma from
You fill me with love I can give
You fill me with life I can live
You fill me with song I can sing
And truth that makes the kingdoms ring
On love's music we fly
Through clouds of harmony
And down through the sky
Where people kiss each other's eyes
That looks like a Rocky Mountain spring
And the rainbow people build bridges of life
That blend our hearts
Wouldn't you like to come with me
On a regular old fashioned fantasy
Let the music come and get you along
Let your mind just wander
Do you wanna go for a ride
It's a miracle to just be alive
There's no magic or mystery
You've gotta give yourself a break occasionally
And let the music come and get you along
You can feel it in the air
Like a circle growing
You can tune right into it
If you know what you're looking for
If you want to be a part of it
Open the door to your heart and your mind
You can't help but find
Everybody's got the spirit
There's a train pulling in
To the nearest station
You can go if you want to
If you're gonna get on board
The music is soothing
The rhythm is grooving
People growing all the time in every way
Learning where they are in terms of every day
I have opened up my mind to things
Done things I've never done before
Taken a chance and seen just what
Nothing is the same any more
At times I feel a golden spirit coming through me
Thinking of my life and what it's given to me
I will live within that spirit ever knowing
I'm where I'm supposed to be
Of the force that's all around
There's a harmony of season and direction
This is surely sacred ground
Sweet life is everywhere as we stand in the clover
And through all that I've been blessed
I'm where I'm supposed to be
He can sing you into paradise or bring you to your knees.
A song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified.
The same as yours with every change you play.
It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul.
He can fill a room with sadness as he fills his horn with tears.
The same as yours with every change you play.
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're just time away
Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again could only do me good
Can't say much of anything that's new
If I could only work this life out my way
But you're so far away
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're so far away
I sure do hope the road don't come to own me
There's so many dreams I've yet to find
But you're so far away
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't help to know you're so far away
And sometimes the blues get a hold of you
All around the block people will talk
But I want to give it all that I got
Sure does appeal to me
You know we can get there easily
Just like a sailboat sailing on the sea
And most times you choose between the two
But I'll have some kids and make my plans
And I'll watch the seasons running away
Sure does appeal to me
You know we can get there easily
But I love you like no other
I've been watching everything you do
And I've been wishing only good for you
All you've got to do is just want it to
But I love you like no other
You have always been so good to me
And though you didn't always talk to me
And I don't believe you need
You know I love you like no other
Feeling the warmth as the flames grow higher
I think it's true that nothing
Is really new under the sun
Watching a new love grow
From old love's embers
Yesterday's gone but today remembers
Doesn't it seem to come down the same for everyone
Everything else illusion
Adding to the confusion of the way we connive
Tracing a line till we can define
The thing that allows us to feel
Childhood dreams like muddy waters
Flowing through me to my son and daughters
Everything I ever thought is confirmed as truth to me
Even as I see the way that I want to go now
Still I had wished I had known what I know now
Maybe I could have spared you
Giving your youth to me
Everything else illusion
Adding to the confusion of the way we connive
Tracing a line till we can define
The thing that allows us to feel
I feel the earth move under my feet
Whenever you're around
Mellow as the month of May
I feel the earth move under my feet
Whenever you're around
And you tenderly call my name
I know that my emotions
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
There'll be good times again for me and you
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
He seeks that sheltered nest
Like the sailor's lost horizon
He needs some place to rest
The songs that he's been singing
No longer make much sense
They've killed his confidence
She sails away upon a sea of song
When his tired voice is broken
His golden hope is gone
She makes a lost soul's simple longing
He was strong but he was taken
By the thought of his success
Those spotlight shadows how they lured him
And took him like all the rest
But that old dream don't look good now
No it don't seem quite the same
He needs to hear a tender word
Won't you sing him home again
She sails away upon a sea of songs
When his strength is slowly going
His pride is all but gone
She makes a foolish dreamer listen
Green fields and rolling hills
Room enough to do what we will
Are running though my mind
Of a place I left behind
I've been to Canaan and I wanna go back again
Though I'm content with myself
Sometimes I long to be somewhere else
I try to do what I can
But with our day to day demands
We all need a promised land
And it's been so long
I can't remember when
I've been to Canaan and I wanna go back again
With a fireplace burning to warm me
But I've been to Canaan and I wanna go back again
For a little confrontation.
He didn't think about the noose.
He couldn't take no more abuse
So he shot down the congregation.
You can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand.
Stood for law and order.
He called for the guard to come
And surround the border.
To clean up the streets
You can't talk to a man
When he don't wanna understand.
The account of the capture
With a shotgun in his hand.
A shotgun in his hand.
If you read the papers you may see
History in the making
You'll read what they say life is all about
They say it's there for the taking
If you want to know what's shaking
But don't tell me about the things you've heard
We have been unkind to one another
Tell me how many times has the golden rule
Been applied by man to his brother
I believe if I really looked at what's going on
I would lose faith I never could recover
So don't tell me about the things you've heard
Maybe I'm living with my head in the sand.
I just want to see people giving.
I want to believe in my fellow man.
Was a time I remember
Hope flashed and went dim
When assassins just happened
To do the right people in
And love was a slogan
And they told us they'd work it out
In the swing of changing times
A man cried out for his
And every politician said
He was telling us like it is
And they told us they'd work it out
I see the choking cities
I see them tearing up this earth
That their lives have little worth
And I know that the future
Depends on you and me
I hope we can work it out
I hope we can work it out
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
But your love was the key to my peace of mind
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm living for
Close to you you make me feel so alive
You know you make me feel
The rebel cry of desolation
To which we used to hearken
Echoes now in isolation
As the skies in fury darken
A thousand acts of desecration
Hundreds more continue
You're gonna fight them with all that's in you
I remember time gone by
When peace and hope and dreams were high
We followed inner visions and touched the sky
Now we who still believe won't let them die
Waters dammed to overflowing
Like tears brimming over in our eyes
Sometimes it's so hard to keep on going
When promises turn to lies
And put aside your ideals too
Soon you'll see only illusion
Don't care who's hurt
As long as it's not you
And is followed for a while
Doesn't matter what he encourages
Just as long as he's got style
Young ones conceived in a passion
Grown up they follow the mood in fashion
Why don't you move lightly
Why don't you move lightly
That's your heart you're dealing with
Why don't you move lightly
Pretty soon you're gonna know what you wanna know
Why don't you walk softly
You ought to walk softly
That's a hard and heavy foot
Why don't you walk softly
If you win the world and lose your soul
If there's something you're still after
Are you sure you're gonna like the way it'll make you feel
Another day is over and you're still not back
Quarter moon is rising up over my head
With stars for companions and clouds for a bed
Dreamlike I wander through my life without you
I just don't understand
Don't know every morning if the dawn's gray or gold
All I know is another night is over
And my bed is empty and cold
Can't set myself free
I hope you find peace of mind
I'm on my way to somewhere through tomorrow
Would you care to walk with me today
Nowhere in particular to go
And nothing to conceal
I may not have an awful lot to say
You can be anything you want to
And I don't know what lies beyond the crossroad
I got no past or future on my mind
Think they know all there is to know
One of my favorite places to go
I've traveled in vehicles over miles of country
Too fast to stop and look around
It's good to feel my feet back on the ground
It's quite a sight to see rednecks and longhairs
After years on the opposite sides of the fence
Working it out with good old common sense
From the shelter of your solitude you see her
Running circles round the emptiness within
And you wonder what it's been like to be her
As you feel yourself awakening
Though she fills her life between with new adventure
There's confusion in her eyes each time you meet
You don't think she's gonna last another winter
You can't believe you still want her
After all these years of knowing her so well
She's too insecure to ever really change
You've convinced yourself this time you'll be objective
There's no reason to believe it will be different
She's still playing games and running from herself
But you've always thought you love for her could save her
May you travel bright and cheery
The many roads ahead you'll have to blaze
Gonna be hard times to make you weary
It's a part of the passing of the days
With all the people in the middle
Selling things that self destruct and make us bleed
One day it's all gonna fall down
Then you'll find out you're all you really need
May you wonder through the changes
With the warmth of the sun behind the haze
When your lifestyle quickly rearranges
May you follow the passing of the days
We trade our money for magic words
Like Dumbo flying high in the nightly show
You think you can't fly without them
But someday when it happens you will know
May you travel bright and cheery
The many roads ahead you'll have to blaze
Gonna be hard times to make you weary
It's a part of the passing of the days
Something they call freedom of choice
That you should not live without
And it's me that's on the line
But I've been crazy for a long time
You take your action on weekends at a time
But you can make all week your own
You see security in the chrome American dream
With available extremes
But it's hard to make up your mind with a programmed brain
Eagle wants to fly again
Though she's been shot down
Though her wings still touch the ground
Soon she's gonna rise up
With a pure and joyful sound
Strong heart feels abandoned
He's been away from what he loves the best
But his spirit isn't broken
He feels content around the Eagle's nest
And you know whatever strong heart does
He never longs for what was
He lives each moment to the end
Eagle wants to fly again
Though she's been shot down
Though her wings still touch the ground
Soon she's gonna rise up
With a pure and joyful sound
Through it all she tends her young ones
Doing what she can to help them grow
Maybe they will fly away before her
And her only choice is just to let them go
Eagle sees her sister
Living free up on the mountain top
So she doubles her effort
Till you think that she is bound to drop
But Eagle has the courage
You can tell that she's been felled before
Since a time before my memory
He's been without a home
Once he lived on an open plain where wildlife grazed
And buffalo used to roam
Red was the sunrise on the dawn of his creation
Now where is the road that will lead him to his destination
It took so little time to destroy a way of life
They served his people well
Gifts that they gave in all good faith
Have been misused and shot to hell
In the future of my days ahead
I want to see it right
Never been the kind to stay at home
Even when I'm feeling down
So every night I go out on the town
But every night I find
It's not as easy as I thought it would be
To dance you out of my mind
I can't control my emotions
Ever since we said our goodbyes
Don't you know you can find me any old time
Now anything can happen in this day and age
Just take a look at me
My body keeps moving to the happy beat
While my spirit's in misery
You can't see it with the strobe lights flashing
But there's a whole different picture you'll see of me
When you get a look at my face
I can't control my emotions
Ever since we said our goodbyes
Don't you know you can find me any old time
Come on baby do the locomotion
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
Come on baby do the locomotion
My little baby sister can do it with ease
It's easier than learning your ABC's
You gotta swing your hips now
Come on baby jump up jump back
Now that you can do it let's make a chain now
Come on baby do the locomotion
Come on baby do the locomotion
Do it nice and easy now and don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
Move around the floor in a locomotion
Come on baby do the locomotion
Come on baby do the locomotion
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue
Though I know you're the kind of boy
Who only wants to run around
And then you'll want the love you threw away before
Hey girl I want you to know
I'm gonna miss you so much if you go
And hey girl I tell you no lie
Hey girl this can't be true
How am I supposed to exist without you
And hey girl now don't put me on
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone
Hey girl now sit yourself down
I'm not ashamed to get down on the ground
And then beg you to stay
I beg you please don't go away
High on a snow covered mountain
From her throne she looks down at the clowns
Who think youth can be found in a fountain
High on the wings of her rhythms
She will smile at the guys who come on with their eyes
But she'll never dance with them
And in smoke filled rooms of electric sound
A legend is built around... The Snow Queen
You may believe you're a winner
But with her you'll soon bite the dust
And discover you're just a beginner
You may not think you're a loser
You trip on your tongue
And it'll only amuse her
In the morning haze you are frozen there
Caught in the icy stare of The Snow Queen
No my friend she doesn't want what you're selling
And into the night you'll fade knowing you lost the game
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Now believe me when I tell you
But I can't break away from all of these chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
I wanna tell you pretty baby
But I can't break away from all these chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
When my friends told me you had someone new
I didn't believe a single word was true
I showed them all I had a faith in you
I just kept on saying
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies
My mama told me when rumors spread
There's truth somewhere and I should use my head
But I didn't listen to what she said
I kept right on saying
You're not like those other boys
Who play with hearts like they were toys
But I am sure it didn't mean a thing
And I'm so glad that I kept on saying
We go together just like summer and spring
They're all jealous of the love you bring
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies
Gonna get me a piece of the sky
I've been down so long
Bottom looked like up
Once I thought that second saves
Was enough to fill my cup
Now I offered all I got
And that ain't no way to live
Who got the least amount to give
And said you could have your pick
But when he laid the paper on me
And he showed me where to sign
Wasn't born to follow
No I'd rather go and journey
Where the diamond crescents flowing
And run across the valley
Beneath the sacred mountain
And wander through the forest
Where the trees have leaves of prisms
That make the light up into colors
That no one know the names of
And when it's time I'll go and lay
Beside the legendary fountain
Till I see her form reflected
In its clear and gentle waters
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our visions
Flow into one another
And I'll stay awhile and wonder
At the mist that they created
And lose myself within it
Cleanse my mind and body
And I know at that moment
As I stand at cathedral
Beneath the white cascading water
She may beg and she may plead
And she may argue with her logic
Mention all the things I'll lose
That really have no value
Come to understand my meaning
In the end she'll surely know
I think I'm going back
To the things I learned so well
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough
Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more electric trains
No more trees to climb
Thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out
A lot more than just my toys
Now there's much to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
A little bit of courage is all we lack
A little bit of courage is all we lack
Through all of the madness
And all of the sadness
Sending the love so it's
Spreading out endlessly
Now there are those moments
When life loses meaning
And we lose our faith in
The dreams we've been dreaming
When people seem mindless
And plain human kindness
Sending the love so it's
Spreading out endlessly
I know the shape we're in
But with all the confusion
I've reached the conclusion
There's only one place to begin
Sending the love so it's
The moon is full and I'm awake
And I don't know how much
Before I get too angry to be sad
Good ones few and far between
You've got to keep your guard up
If someone else is hard up
He'll try to steal your dreams away
Once I thought of compassion as
That's the golden rule
But I found to my regret
People I had never met
You've got to keep your guard up
If someone else is hard up
What kind of fool do you think I am
To believe you really give a damn
Just look behind the silver screen you've built around yourself
You will find you're just the same as anybody else
What kind of fool are you gonna be
What kind of chance are you willing to take
Are you willing to give just a little bit for your own sake
You hold my heart in your hand
You made me understand
The pain the earth is feeling
You know what love is worth
Your purpose on earth
And I can see the sun
Beneath the crescent moon you stand
You speak to the wind and
Unmistakably it answers
And just like two dancers
And I can see the sun
You wrap your love around me
And I know my soul has found me
By the way we blend again and again
The land is our destiny and
You have brought me home to it
Together we'll build our dream
I know that we can do it
I wrote you a letter the other day
And I told you I was happy for you
Now there was much more
But it's hard for me to get over
But if you read between the lines
You will know that I still love you
When we were together
You would ever be anything else
But a friend and a true love
But time has thrown its net
And I'm helpless to tell you
How much I miss you by my side
But if you read between the lines
You will know that I still love you
Do you remember smiling at me
But it's over now and I just can't see
How I'm gonna live without you
But if you read between the lines
You will know that I still love you
If you want to give your heart
Don't be afraid to try
Love is like a boomerang
It comes right back to you
You've got a need for company
Someone you know will be there
Don't let your bruised and battered soul deny it
My scars are plain to see
But love's been good to me
And I know it's because I was willing to try it
So if you want to love again
Don't hesitate any more
Love is like a boomerang
It comes right back to you
Mountains are there for you to climb
People are doing it all the time
You can make it to the top if you make your attempt a strong one
So if you want to give your heart
Don't be afraid to try
Love is like a boomerang
It comes right back to you
Comes right back to you
When I was young I used to see her
To hold on to what she's got
They call her Goat Annie
I still remember the stories
The townspeople told to each other
Just because she liked her goats
They said the devil was her brother
She never paid them no mind
She's a rare individual
Is all she'll ever need
One day the government decided
The land she lived on
They came with the papers
They said she had just thirty days
You could see them smirking
Ain't never done wrong to no one
Me or my goats or my shotgun
Next day they came with the lawmen
They decided to let her
Live her days out there
It doesn't happen very often
But there are still some people
When the sun goes down
Some stranger may knock
And it may be like knowing
Someone you never met before
Now it may be a common sensation
It may lead to sadness or elation
That you never had before
And it may be like knowing
Someone you never met before
The game's not been played
Until you discover your love
She's waiting for you
And don't live life lonely
Goes down on the city
And it may be like knowing
Someone you never met before
Using everybody at your beck and call
You could have it all
If you only knew who you really are
Does your little town exist
Or is it just too far from your reality
I know it can't be very easy
To be brought up treated royally
Who cater to you loyally
Don't it make you wonder
As you listen for the thunder
There's something in the quiet
Though I know you don't
You will never find your spirit
The coldness that you show me tells me you don't know me
And that leaves our love so little room for growing
Don't want to program making love
I like it real and with feeling
It's like I kind of get the feeling that I'm stealing
So you're gonna have to find another computer eyes to lie to
The Emperor's got no clothes on
Don't let the people hear the words he has to say
Speaking out in honesty
Speaking with the values we were taught as children
You can't hide from yourself
Lies take their toll on you
One small voice speaking out in honesty
One small voice speaking with the values we were taught as children
You can change the world
But you'd better be strong
One small voice can change the world
I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All my sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain
If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you so though
The heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain
Could never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I look for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
You'll never see me complain
Even the sword of love cannot penetrate you
Now I think I hate you
When I was younger I believed your lies
Your shield and armor that would not compromise
You won your war with a ghostly kiss
Whoever thought it would come to this
Maybe if I saw you shed a tear
You've got nothing to fear
To survive in the ruin
I think its time for me to turn away
You invented the world we're living in today
When you inherit the earth and all its gold
It's not my hand you will get to hold
Even the sword of love cannot penetrate you
Now I think I hate you
Decades pass in just one year
And your illusions disappear
And you fear the speeding time
You find a dream that you embrace
Look the other way and it's a race
Trying to keep pace with the speeding time
And it's not easy to laugh at your defeat
In this speeding time
Get your feet on solid ground
It's a nightmare you have found
The howling sound of speeding time
Decipher echoes down the halls
But don't you fall in the speeding time
Drifting back is no way to begin
In this speeding time
You never listened when the prophets said
Prepare yourself for times that lie ahead
Now that you know they didn't speak a lie
There's nothing for you to do except to try
Between falling in love and falling apart
I'm ready to cross the borderline
Nothing really holds a candle to love
I'm too close to the borderline
Every day can't be a fireworks show
And it starts to glow
You don't have to tell me
We're ready to cross the borderline
Between falling in love and falling apart
We're ready to cross the borderline
Ready to cross the borderline
Ready to cross the borderline
I've been waiting to find someone just like you
I knew when I saw you
I'd be someone who could bring out the best in you
I would be good for you
Though I don't know you well
You're so ready for love
It's a new moon tonight
And you're so ready for love
Hide your head in the sand
By the way you look at me
You're so ready for love
It's a new moon tonight
And you're so ready for love
How many people get the chance to love again
Though you might think that you can do without it
But if you pass and lose someone who's really right for you
There won't be a thing that you can do about it
Maybe I've been on too heavy for you
But I believe we can do it
By the way you look at me
You're so ready for love
It's a new moon tonight
Molly don't work in Dallas
But the river has to go
Barren pastures all around
Where did the mountain go
Where did the mountain go
Where did the mountain go
Your mother bears you no malice
But she will have her turn
No wonderland for Alice
I dance a little closer to you and watch you dance away
Hard selling what we both know tomorrow you may
Not be able to give away
And as I leave the stage
Dancing through my rage
Moving through the ballet
To watch the choreography
As we play out our fantasy
You pirouette too smoothly as you move around your ladies
And your fear of lonely nights
As you leap across the air
You're so perfectly aware
Of your audience in rapt attention
As you hang suspended there
You do have a tender side
As you've always been afraid to be
I have always wanted to be a girl like you
Long of leg and seeing the world the way you do
But you're in tiny golden chains
Somehow I think you know it don't make sense for you
To let your wings be held by someone
Who's too intense for you
You are such a sweet and sensual spirit
There's a joy within him singing
Still the child within remains
And though he knows that you have pains to talk about
He sees your soul as you walk about
And doesn't dare to let himself get near it
Your life is just beginning
Your consciousness begun
Like a sleepy child awakening
As you reach out for me
With confidence still to come
Can you teach me to be free
Of my fear of being struck down by the pendulum
As you weave a web of love with azure flowers
The early morning hours
Bring to you the misty light of dawn
To hold you closer to him
If you only knew your powers
You can save him if you try
Come on Alabaster Lady
And let yourself just fly
Chills run through my bones
Tides of life are ebbing out
Between the cobblestones
The streets are on fire
With the burning sunrise
And over the water I look in vain
For love in someone's eyes
The stories that they tell
Winter colored morning
Reflecting the mood I'm in
Despair is all around
I long for sweet oblivion
To take me from my pain
Maybe bring me dreams of hope and faith
Lovers with their arms entwined
Silhouettes against the light
A warm bed is waiting as they head home
After staying up all night
For them the city is magic
That's all they've ever known
I wish I could find the magic
But I'm scared and I'm feeling so alone
So you think you got the weight
Of the world on your shoulders
And it's getting too hard to bear
You feel like you're getting older and older
And nobody seems to care
Ain't that the way it is any more
Makes you keep on wondering
Don't it make you wonder now
What are you living for
You can give it another try
You can make of it what you will
You can look at the downside or take your chances
And try to make it uphill
Now you can't keep living inside your head
In a prison cell all your own
You don't have to do it all alone
You can give it another try
Why don't you take another look around
You can stop and taste the honey
You can give it another try
Out into the light of day
Everyone's out in the afternoon
Turning their faces up to the sun like a spotlight
I look around and I see all the signs
I know you're gonna take me down to the darkness
I know you're gonna take me down to the darkness
I'm afraid of the dark
I'm afraid of the dark
Through my hazy confusion
Seared into my memory
Now as I stand on the edge of the precipice
Looking down into the black abyss
I know I'll be lost with just one kiss
Even as the tongues of fire lick at me from below
I know you're gonna take me down
I know you're gonna take me down to the darkness
I know you're gonna take me down to the darkness
I want you to take me down to the darkness
I want to see the longing in your eyes
I want it to be the way it used to be
I want to feel the passion in your touch
I want to feel the burning love I need so much
I want you to hold me like you used to do
You used to walk with me on the street of dreams
I remember you telling me
You said nothing is what is seems
Thoughts of you in someone else's arms
In someone else's bed
Explode inside my head
I want to see the fire back in your eyes
I want it to be the way it used to be
A candle's burning in my window
And it's burning just for you
I had some big plans for tomorrow
But you had something else to do
You came to me right out of nowhere
You gave me shelter in your eyes
And though you let the walls come caving in
When the cold wind blew
I can't stop thinking about you
You let me walk into your dream world
You gave me things I couldn't steal
And in the wee hours of the morning
I still believe the dream was real
Why did you show me all your colors
When you knew that I was blind
Still I keep looking for the reasons
That'll see me through
I can't stop thinking about you
I can't stop thinking about you
I can't stop thinking about you
There are voices in my house
I'll hit the town tonight
The party lights won't shine tonight
You used to be as a child
Full of hope and wonder
Your mind was free and running wild
Now the sound of thunder
Has got you trapped in a corner hiding out
You're running in a rat maze
You better think about the legacy
That you want to leave behind
Bought and sold to the bottom line
That ain't the way it's gotta be
You can leave a better world than you find
But you can't put it out of your mind
Don't it make your heart bleed
Passing through the meadowland
Wheel of fortune jackpot is what it looks like
Rev it up to five grand
But as you barrel down the turnpike
You better think about the legacy
That you're gonna leave behind
Things are getting wasted out of hand
People stealing each other blind
You can leave a better world than you find
But you can't put it out of your mind
It isn't easy when you think your voice
Doesn't matter to anyone
Maybe you believe there's nothing you can do
To perpetuate the destruction
You better think about the legacy
That you want to leave behind
Sold to the bottom line
But you can't put it out of your mind
Whenever you think you've got it made
Everything changes on you
Nothing is stranger than the truth
And how it comes to you
In this life we are living
And through all our tribulations
We reach out for each other
Whenever you think you're in control
Everything turns around
One day you're flying
Next day you're on the ground
You never know what's gonna happen
And sometimes in quiet desperation
You realize it's never gonna be the way it was
Whenever you think you've got it all
There's a wall in front of you
The flashing neon excites my blood
Breathing in the carnival air
That old street of dreams has got my head spinning
Being there at the pleasure fair
I'm no stranger to danger
He's been my lifelong friend
I can feel the pulse of the city
Who knows how it will end
And the sun won't rise till five
And I don't care if I'm spending my money
At least I feel alive
Suburban village has gone to sleep
But I'm just waking up
The night holds a promise I intend to keep
To fill my loving cup
I know it's a long shot
But tonight I'm gonna take a chance
I can feel the rhythm of the city
It's my turn to dance
And the sun won't rise till five
I don't care if I'm spending my money
At least I feel alive
I'm gonna keep on moving to the beat of the city
Until the break of day
The lantern moon hung high and gold
In the cold November sky
The locust sang a midnight song
And starlight wind was a sigh
And you moved me with no hand
Like the moon moves the sea
What I wouldn't give for the love that used to be
The icy roofs below me now
Shelter all the souls within
From the thought of what could have been
Why does laughter remembered
Always lead me to tears
Why do you do this to yourself
You ought to leave the dust on the shelf
There must be someone else in the dark
I ache in a place so deep
If you walked in on me right now
Why did you let me go
Brings your number to my mind
Another piece of yesterday
That I should be leaving behind
Will I make it to the morning
Without hearing your voice
Or will I surrender to my
Why do you do this to yourself
You ought to leave the dust on the shelf
There must be someone else in the dark
Someone who believes in you
When there's a dark storm your horizon
And you think you can't get through it
Just put your hand in my hand
And I'll show you how to do it
When your future looks uncertain
You can count on me to be there
And when your heart and soul are hurting
Just look and you'll see me there
I'll give you what you need
A love that's always true
Is some who believes in you
It's time to come alive
Your moment has arrived
I'll bring out the best in you
Looking down from our celestial view
So when you're searching for that rainbow
I will help you find it
And when a mountain stands before you
I will help you climb it
Just follow where I lead
I'll give you what you need
And I'll tell you something else
You'll start believing in yourself
It's an easy thing to do
When you've got someone who
I'm someone who believes
You've got someone who
My world comes tumbling down
You'll go home again without me
Where will I go tomorrow
It doesn't matter if you want me to stay
Or should I keep on walking away
It feels so good with you
It feels so right with you
But I will bring you sorrow if I stay
I would lay down my life for you
I would lay down my life for you
I would lay down my life for you
I would lay down my life for you
When going on made no real sense at all
Now that my back is against the wall
How will you get through tomorrow
And we'll be together forever
Bound by the way we made each other feel
And I will lay down my life for you
I will lay down my life for you
Yes it feels so right with you
I will lay down my life for you
I will lay down my life for you
I will lay down my life
Everybody's got a little child inside
Still looking for love
Everything we do is in search of it
Everything we say or think of
And every time we reach for somebody
We're reaching out for love
Everybody's looking for love
Everybody is looking for love
When someone says a kind word
It's music to your ears
Yet somewhere inside you're wondering
If you really deserve to let go of your fears
To escape the loneliness and the tears
That you've had for years
Everybody's looking for love
Everybody is looking for love
But you know you gotta
Maybe you're looking for security
You're gonna miss the love you wish you had
Love will be worth the wait
Everybody's looking for love
Everybody is looking for love
But you know you gotta
We met along the back streets where we would not be seen
Until the night you left me standing in the rain
I had the midnight sun with you
Now I'm standing in the rain
Another woman answered when I called you in the morning
The sound of her voice came without a warning
I guess there are some promises you just can't keep
I'm still wandering down those back streets
But with a different point of view
Why did you leave me standing
And the memory cuts like a knife
Didn't we find the ecstasy
Didn't we share the daylight
When you walked into my life
All the promises still unbroken
And think about all the words between us
That never needed to be spoken
We are the lucky ones
Some people never get to do
I will always think of you
Didn't we come together
Didn't we live together
Didn't we cry together
Didn't we play together
Didn't we love together
And together we lit up the world
I miss the day we met and all that followed after
Sometimes I wish I could always be with you
The way we used to do
I will always think of you
I will always be with you
Like a ghost of the future hovering dark and dreamy
You fade in and out of the mist
I feel you just beyond a star
Do you know how much you are all I ever wanted
Is it too much too soon
Am I foolishly dreaming
Just baying at the moon
Playing impossible visions like an elementary tune
How I wish that I could realize my heart
Know everything you see is not quite what it seems
Take everything you have to give
All you gotta do is say you will
Go for the vision in your mind
You are the owner of the game
Nothing will ever be the same once you have played it
You know you're gonna win if you just say you will
Is where angels ride the sunset and heaven lies below
So dream of the day when you will fly
And let the wings of your destiny carry you through the sky
Take everything you have to give
Vera comes home on Sunday morning after hanging with the boys all night
And that makes everything all right
She vaguely remembers going out in the parking lot
With the stone mason's son
I've cried so many tears over man's unkindness to man
A pack of jokers get their jollies beating up on a black king
There's outrage in the city for a while
But do you think it'll really change anything
And let the games commence
We gotta take our power back
And use it in ways that make sense
I was trying to get from here to there
Looking for an elevation that would get me a little higher
The man was apologetic as he turned his head to say
I wish I knew a way I could forget you
But another situation put me to the test
Had fallen on the track and no one even got depressed
Or even guessed he wasn't putting on an act
Someone said he'd drunk too much
It was also duly noted that he happened to be black
There was a serious lack of anything right at all here
The very least I could have done was call a cop
And put some coins I had found
What is going on here
Will I ever know the truth
How do to deal with the time stealing away your daddy's youth
Story after story of disaster barely missed
And anyone can be kissed by lady fortune
So I gathered up my skirt and tucked my wallet in
Grabbed my bag and the sling I carried my girl child in
She could see a happy outcome in the patterns on the wall
Holding it together with barely any motion
Like so many motes of dust
My dreams keep stirring in me
Running red on the streets below me
While passionate strangers whisper desire
All I know is I'm on fire
I need just one thing I can believe in
Just one thing I can believe in
Hiding in the shadows
I want to stand in the light
Trust is unknown to me
I've been betrayed by the night so long
I can never belong to anyone any more
Why does everybody think they know me
Nobody knows what's deep in my soul
I need just one thing I can believe in
Give me just one thing
I wanted to believe that love was the one thing
I come out of the darkness
The moon in my fantasy smiles down on me
I am a child running wild and free
But then the fight for survival
Takes me out of my illusion
Trapped in a rhythm I don't want to repeat
The taste of freedom is so close and sweet
I need just one thing I can believe in
I gotta find one thing
Just one thing I can believe in
I need one thing I can believe in
Let me find one thing
She lives in the land of the used to be
She tries so hard just to stay in touch
A half cup of coffee steaming in her hand
Too bad things didn't turn out quite the way she planned
She had hold of the brass ring but it came back sand
Do you feel love tonight
Do you feel love tonight
Yesterday I ran into an old friend
Standing on a corner in a cold sweat
So I took him walking down on Deal Street
He told me all about the fear when the night winds blow
Hey you don't need to hold on to wrongs of long ago
Do you feel love tonight
Do you feel love tonight
Do you feel love tonight
You write your life story in your dreams at night
And hope your life turns out that way
In your racy lacy underwear you long for love
But love eludes you every day
All the old suspicions well up in your mind
But you got the power to get out of the line
Do you feel love tonight
I used to watch all the couples going by
Feeling left out and so alone
But now I feel so much a part of them
Because I've got a man of my own
It's never too late to fall in love again
And I just love everything that you do
When I needed the comfort of a strong man's arms
You chased away my blues
Remember the first time when we made love
It's never too late to fall in love again
To sit there remembering when
No matter how much pain and heartache you've known
Never too late to love again
It's never too late to fall in love again
It's never too late to fall in love again
It's never too late to fall in love again
It's never too late to fall in love again
I just love every little thing that you do
Downtown anywhere in the USA
Put your money on a number anyone can play
Come on and tell us all about what happened to you today
After a hard day's work I guarantee
There just isn't anywhere better to be
If you're unable to find good company
You can always sit down and watch the color TV
And if you're feeling just a little bit lonely
Don't sit at home just hoping
Come on down to where the spirits flow so free
You know that door is always open
When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space
On the roof it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below can't bother me
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I get away from the hustling crowds
And all that rat race noise down in the street
On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
At night the stars put on a show for free
Right smack dab in the middle of town
So if this world starts getting you down
For a little confrontation.
He didn't think about the noose.
He couldn't take no more abuse
So he shot down the congregation.
You can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand.
Stood for law and order.
He called for the guard to come
And surround the border.
To clean up the streets
You can't talk to a man
When he don't wanna understand.
The account of the capture
With a shotgun in his hand.
A shotgun in his hand.
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're just time away
Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again could only do me good
Can't say much of anything that's new
If I could only work this life out my way
But you're so far away
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're so far away
I sure do hope the road don't come to own me
There's so many dreams I've yet to find
But you're so far away
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't help to know you're so far away
You've got to get up every morning
With a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
That you're beautiful as you feel
I've got nothing to do but watch the passersby
Mirrored in their faces I see frustration growing
You've got to get up every morning
With a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
That you're beautiful as you feel
I have often asked myself for reason for sadness
In a world where tears are just a lullaby
You've got to get up every morning
With a smile in your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
But your love was the key to my peace of mind
Cause you make me feel
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm living for
Close to you you make me feel so alive
You know you make me feel
Everybody's got a little child inside
Still looking for love
Everything we do is in search of it
Everything we say or think of
And every time we reach for somebody
We're reaching out for love
Everybody's looking for love
Everybody is looking for love
When someone says a kind word
It's music to your ears
Yet somewhere inside you're wondering
If you really deserve to let go of your fears
To escape the loneliness and the tears
That you've had for years
Everybody's looking for love
Everybody is looking for love
But you know you gotta
Maybe you're looking for security
You're gonna miss the love you wish you had
Love will be worth the wait
Everybody's looking for love
Everybody is looking for love
But you know you gotta
Of love is in your eyes
You say that I'm the only one
And I won't ask again
He can sing you into paradise or bring you to your knees.
A song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified.
The same as yours with every change you play.
It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul.
He can fill a room with sadness as he fills his horn with tears.
The same as yours with every change you play.
Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
There'll be good times again for me and you
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Now believe me when I tell you
But I can't break away from all of these chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
I wanna tell you pretty baby
But I can't break away from all these chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
I feel the earth move under my feet
Whenever you're around
Mellow as the month of May
I feel the earth move under my feet
Whenever you're around
And you tenderly call my name
I know that my emotions
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
When you're down and troubled
And you need some love and care
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Now ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
And take your soul if you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Come on baby do the locomotion
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
Come on baby do the locomotion
My little baby sister can do it with ease
It's easier than learning your ABC's
You gotta swing your hips now
Come on baby jump up jump back
Now that you can do it let's make a chain now
Come on baby do the locomotion
Come on baby do the locomotion
Do it nice and easy now and don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
Move around the floor in a locomotion
Come on baby do the locomotion
Come on baby do the locomotion
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue
When you're down and troubled
And you need some love and care
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Now ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
And take your soul if you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Never been the kind to stay at home
Even when I'm feeling down
So every night I go out on the town
But every night I find
It's not as easy as I thought it would be
To dance you out of my mind
I can't control my emotions
Ever since we said our goodbyes
Don't you know you can find me any old time
Now anything can happen in this day and age
Just take a look at me
My body keeps moving to the happy beat
While my spirit's in misery
You can't see it with the strobe lights flashing
But there's a whole different picture you'll see of me
When you get a look at my face
I can't control my emotions
Ever since we said our goodbyes
Don't you know you can find me any old time
Come on baby do the locomotion
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
Come on baby do the locomotion
My little baby sister can do it with ease
It's easier than learning your ABC's
You gotta swing your hips now
Come on baby jump up jump back
Now that you can do it let's make a chain now
Come on baby do the locomotion
Come on baby do the locomotion
Do it nice and easy now and don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
Move around the floor in a locomotion
Come on baby do the locomotion
Come on baby do the locomotion
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue
Though I know you're the kind of boy
Who only wants to run around
And then you'll want the love you threw away before
Hey girl I want you to know
I'm gonna miss you so much if you go
And hey girl I tell you no lie
Hey girl this can't be true
How am I supposed to exist without you
And hey girl now don't put me on
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone
Hey girl now sit yourself down
I'm not ashamed to get down on the ground
And then beg you to stay
I beg you please don't go away
High on a snow covered mountain
From her throne she looks down at the clowns
Who think youth can be found in a fountain
High on the wings of her rhythms
She will smile at the guys who come on with their eyes
But she'll never dance with them
And in smoke filled rooms of electric sound
A legend is built around... The Snow Queen
You may believe you're a winner
But with her you'll soon bite the dust
And discover you're just a beginner
You may not think you're a loser
You trip on your tongue
And it'll only amuse her
In the morning haze you are frozen there
Caught in the icy stare of The Snow Queen
No my friend she doesn't want what you're selling
And into the night you'll fade knowing you lost the game
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Now believe me when I tell you
But I can't break away from all of these chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
I wanna tell you pretty baby
But I can't break away from all these chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
When my friends told me you had someone new
I didn't believe a single word was true
I showed them all I had a faith in you
I just kept on saying
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies
My mama told me when rumors spread
There's truth somewhere and I should use my head
But I didn't listen to what she said
I kept right on saying
You're not like those other boys
Who play with hearts like they were toys
But I am sure it didn't mean a thing
And I'm so glad that I kept on saying
We go together just like summer and spring
They're all jealous of the love you bring
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies
Gonna get me a piece of the sky
I've been down so long
Bottom looked like up
Once I thought that second saves
Was enough to fill my cup
Now I offered all I got
And that ain't no way to live
Who got the least amount to give
And said you could have your pick
But when he laid the paper on me
And he showed me where to sign
Wasn't born to follow
No I'd rather go and journey
Where the diamond crescents flowing
And run across the valley
Beneath the sacred mountain
And wander through the forest
Where the trees have leaves of prisms
That make the light up into colors
That no one know the names of
And when it's time I'll go and lay
Beside the legendary fountain
Till I see her form reflected
In its clear and gentle waters
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our visions
Flow into one another
And I'll stay awhile and wonder
At the mist that they created
And lose myself within it
Cleanse my mind and body
And I know at that moment
As I stand at cathedral
Beneath the white cascading water
She may beg and she may plead
And she may argue with her logic
Mention all the things I'll lose
That really have no value
Come to understand my meaning
In the end she'll surely know
I think I'm going back
To the things I learned so well
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough
Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more electric trains
No more trees to climb
Thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out
A lot more than just my toys
Now there's much to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
A little bit of courage is all we lack
A little bit of courage is all we lack
Downtown anywhere in the USA
Put your money on a number anyone can play
Come on and tell us all about what happened to you today
After a hard day's work I guarantee
There just isn't anywhere better to be
If you're unable to find good company
You can always sit down and watch the color TV
And if you're feeling just a little bit lonely
Don't sit at home just hoping
Come on down to where the spirits flow so free
You know that door is always open
Do the things you believe in
And know that you aren't alone
We all have doubts and fears
Know throughout every season
You are the name of love
And you'll keep on feeling at home
Throughout the coming years
Change is for certain
Each day opening the curtain
Through your sorrow and grieving
Don't forget the name of love
It goes on without any end
Birth and life and death make a circle
To see the light ever lasting
Live in the name of love
Sometimes I feel like I've been living much too long
And I've wasted too much time
I think I've lost the inner harmony that flows through me
Like the shoreline that divides the sea and sand
I'm a surface ever changing
I get burdened by the things I just don't understand
And all the mountains left to climb
But then the morning sun comes shining through my window
And it's good to be alive
It's gonna be a golden day
If I can only learn the lesson of the seasons
Of a balance rearranging
Though they may not always come just when I want them to
Still they come and keep me high
And the morning sun comes shining through my window
And it's good to be alive
It's gonna be a golden day
Simple things mean a lot to me
Some things only children can see
Simple things like horses running free
And easy acceptance of life
Simple things never compromise
All things have a rhythm I can't realize
I feel content in my freedom
And I feel my freedom is right
I never want to stop being a child
I want to see the flowers growing wild on the hillside
To see the sun rise in the morning
Simple things of the earth don't die
They just grow and change as time goes by
There are no questions without answers
I've found my answer to life is living
The rebel cry of desolation
To which we used to hearken
Echoes now in isolation
As the skies in fury darken
A thousand acts of desecration
Hundreds more continue
You're gonna fight them with all that's in you
I remember time gone by
When peace and hope and dreams were high
We followed inner visions and touched the sky
Now we who still believe won't let them die
Waters dammed to overflowing
Like tears brimming over in our eyes
Sometimes it's so hard to keep on going
When promises turn to lies
And put aside your ideals too
Soon you'll see only illusion
Don't care who's hurt
As long as it's not you
And is followed for a while
Doesn't matter what he encourages
Just as long as he's got style
Young ones conceived in a passion
Grown up they follow the mood in fashion
From the shelter of your solitude you see her
Running circles round the emptiness within
And you wonder what it's been like to be her
As you feel yourself awakening
Though she fills her life between with new adventure
There's confusion in her eyes each time you meet
You don't think she's gonna last another winter
You can't believe you still want her
After all these years of knowing her so well
She's too insecure to ever really change
You've convinced yourself this time you'll be objective
There's no reason to believe it will be different
She's still playing games and running from herself
But you've always thought you love for her could save her
May you travel bright and cheery
The many roads ahead you'll have to blaze
Gonna be hard times to make you weary
It's a part of the passing of the days
With all the people in the middle
Selling things that self destruct and make us bleed
One day it's all gonna fall down
Then you'll find out you're all you really need
May you wonder through the changes
With the warmth of the sun behind the haze
When your lifestyle quickly rearranges
May you follow the passing of the days
We trade our money for magic words
Like Dumbo flying high in the nightly show
You think you can't fly without them
But someday when it happens you will know
May you travel bright and cheery
The many roads ahead you'll have to blaze
Gonna be hard times to make you weary
It's a part of the passing of the days
Here we are in time alone
No one else's feelings but our own
Seems to me that we have always known
What love was meant to be
Separately we stood before
Life was good but we knew there should
Time alone could open up the door
And you came through for me
No sign of the changes we have come through
No mind of the strangers who think they
Now as one we are the a light
Though sometimes we were blinded by the night
Here in time alone it all seems right
And I'm feeling wholly free
Look at them fancy wheels
The Great American Pastime
Is still the automobile
Is the only way to make time
On Main Street Saturday night
But all of them will get down
If the right thing comes around
Here comes Little Willie
If Willie's got a line on
It's got to be dynamite
You know you can trust him
I have opened up my mind to things
Done things I've never done before
Taken a chance and seen just what
Nothing is the same any more
At times I feel a golden spirit coming through me
Thinking of my life and what it's given to me
I will live within that spirit ever knowing
I'm where I'm supposed to be
Of the force that's all around
There's a harmony of season and direction
This is surely sacred ground
Sweet life is everywhere as we stand in the clover
And through all that I've been blessed
I'm where I'm supposed to be
Gonna get me a piece of the sky
I've been down so long
Bottom looked like up
Once I thought that second saves
Was enough to fill my cup
Now I offered all I got
And that ain't no way to live
Who got the least amount to give
And said you could have your pick
But when he laid the paper on me
And he showed me where to sign

Beneath the white cascading water
She may beg and she may plead
And she may argue with her logic
Mention all the things I'll lose
That really have no value
Come to understand my meaning
In the end she'll surely know
When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space
On the roof it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below can't bother me
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I get away from the hustling crowds
And all that rat race noise down in the street
On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
At night the stars put on a show for free
Right smack dab in the middle of town
So if this world starts getting you down
Although you see the world different than me
Sometimes I can touch upon the wonders that you see
And all the new colors and pictures you've designed
So glad you are a child of mine
You're the one who taught me you don't have to look behind
So glad you are a child of mine
Nobody's gonna kill your dreams or tell you how to live your life
There'll always be people who make it hard for a while
But you'll change their heads when they see you smile
The times you were born in may not have been the best
But you can make the times to come better than the rest
I know you will be honest if you can't always be kind
I feel the earth move under my feet
Whenever you're around
Mellow as the month of May
I feel the earth move under my feet
Whenever you're around
And you tenderly call my name
I know that my emotions
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're just time away
Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again could only do me good
Can't say much of anything that's new
If I could only work this life out my way
But you're so far away
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're so far away
I sure do hope the road don't come to own me
There's so many dreams I've yet to find
But you're so far away
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't help to know you're so far away
Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
There'll be good times again for me and you
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
Sometimes I wonder if I'm ever gonna make it home again
It's so far and out of sight
I really need someone to talk to and nobody else
Knows how to comfort me tonight
Chills my soul right to the marrow
Chills my soul right to the marrow
You've got to get up every morning
With a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
That you're beautiful as you feel
I've got nothing to do but watch the passersby
Mirrored in their faces I see frustration growing
You've got to get up every morning
With a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
That you're beautiful as you feel
I have often asked myself for reason for sadness
In a world where tears are just a lullaby
You've got to get up every morning
With a smile in your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
Is a place that I know
Where I can find shelter
From a hunger and cold
That's where I'm bound
I know when I get there
The first thing I'll see
Is the sun shining golden
Shining right down on me
Then trouble's gonna lose me
Worry leave me behind
And I'll stand up proudly
In true peace of mind
Is a place I have seen
In a garden of wisdom
From some long ago dream
To the land where the honey runs
That's where I'm bound
When you're down and troubled
And you need some love and care
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Now ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
And take your soul if you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Wanting you the way I do
I only wanna be with you
And I would go to the ends of the earth
Cause darling to me that's what you're worth
If you're out on the road
Feeling lonely and so cold
All you have to do is call my name
I always wanted a real home
With flowers on the windowsill
But if you wanna live in New York City
I never thought I could get satisfaction
But if anyone could keep me happy
You're the one who can
I'm gonna follow where you lead
I'm gonna follow where you lead
I'm gonna follow where you lead
I'm gonna follow where you lead
Of love is in your eyes
You say that I'm the only one
And I won't ask again
For a little confrontation.
He didn't think about the noose.
He couldn't take no more abuse
So he shot down the congregation.
You can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand.
Stood for law and order.
He called for the guard to come
And surround the border.
To clean up the streets
You can't talk to a man
When he don't wanna understand.
The account of the capture
With a shotgun in his hand.
A shotgun in his hand.
My life has been a tapestry
An everlasting vision
Once amid the soft silver
A drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth
Around his leathered hide
He moved with some uncertainty
Just what he was there for
Or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something
Golden hanging from a tree
He sat down on a river rock
And turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen
Into someone's wicked spell
Though I didn't know him well.
There suddenly appeared
A figure gray and ghostly
Beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness
I've seen him dressed in black.
He's come to take me back.
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
But your love was the key to my peace of mind
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm living for
Close to you you make me feel so alive
You know you make me feel
Music is playing inside my head
Over and over and over again
But the music keeps playing
And won't let the cold get me down.
Pictures are forming inside my brain
Soon with the colors they'll rain together and grow
But the music keeps playing
And won't let the world get me down.
Music is playing inside
Music is playing inside
Music is playing inside
But I love you like no other
I've been watching everything you do
And I've been wishing only good for you
All you've got to do is just want it to
But I love you like no other
You have always been so good to me
And though you didn't always talk to me
And I don't believe you need
You know I love you like no other
And sometimes the blues get a hold of you
All around the block people will talk
But I want to give it all that I got
Sure does appeal to me
You know we can get there easily
Just like a sailboat sailing on the sea
And most times you choose between the two
But I'll have some kids and make my plans
And I'll watch the seasons running away
Sure does appeal to me
You know we can get there easily
A fence around my kind.
Not leastwise peace of mind.
Is just another sign.
Sometimes when I think that things
I see a fella standing
Lower down on the ladder than me.
Long as I got my soul
I'm on the good end of the deal
It's going to take some time this time
To get myself in shape.
I really missed the gate.
And I'll find some harmony.
And I can't make demands.
I'll learn how to bend.
And it's going to take some time this time.
No matter what I've planned.
I'll learn how to bend.
And I'm on the road again
Bitter with the sweet
About being someplace at some time
You've got to take the bitter with the sweet
You think you're not having fun
And you wonder what you're doing
Playing the games you play
You've got to take the bitter with the sweet
A friend of mine once told me
He said everything good in life
You've got to pay for
Though it seems the blues will never end
And I can tell you that it's true
It's a feeling that can't be beat
And you've got to do it
Goodbye don't mean I'm gone
Don't it seem like the time goes on
And here we are still carrying on
Reaching out for one another
Like a telephone call
From an old friend or a brother
And you are there to share this
Goodbye don't mean I'm gone
I know how alone you are
When it's so hard to be so far
From the ones who mean the most to you
Have them close to you
I hope you know you haven't been forsaken
Goodbye don't mean I'm gone
I'll never be what you think you see in me
If I can help you deal with what you see as real
That makes me glad to have known you
Missing you the way I do
You know I'd like to see more of you
But it's all I can do to be a mother
I've a pen in the other
You know my love is always there for the taking
At this time in my life very conscious of who I am
I know that who I am doesn't matter
All the chatter that goes on between
As we talked around what we really mean
Really makes me wonder
At this time in my life
A feeling I can't control
Is creeping up inside my soul and growing
Wouldn't knowing help me to work it out
I can't be afraid of thunder
At this time in my life
At this time in my life let me stop
Let me take control of myself and be me
I can see me in a few years
Trying to see where reality has gone
I won't let it take me under
At this time in my life
I won't let it take me under
Green fields and rolling hills
Room enough to do what we will
Are running though my mind
Of a place I left behind
I've been to Canaan and I wanna go back again
Though I'm content with myself
Sometimes I long to be somewhere else
I try to do what I can
But with our day to day demands
We all need a promised land
And it's been so long
I can't remember when
I've been to Canaan and I wanna go back again
With a fireplace burning to warm me
But I've been to Canaan and I wanna go back again
That love's so hard to find
All the ties that bind
The times when I can hold you
In my heart and in my mind
Are the times when I can really know you
And leave the rest behind
Go on and make believe if you want to
It's a real good sign
And stay with me if you like to
Needing a connecting line
You tie up with some other people you meet
And the day begins to shine
All the ties that bind
The day begins to shine
In my heart and in my mind
All the ties that bind
If you read the papers you may see
History in the making
You'll read what they say life is all about
They say it's there for the taking
If you want to know what's shaking
But don't tell me about the things you've heard
We have been unkind to one another
Tell me how many times has the golden rule
Been applied by man to his brother
I believe if I really looked at what's going on
I would lose faith I never could recover
So don't tell me about the things you've heard
Maybe I'm living with my head in the sand.
I just want to see people giving.
I want to believe in my fellow man.
He can sing you into paradise or bring you to your knees.
A song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified.
The same as yours with every change you play.
It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul.
He can fill a room with sadness as he fills his horn with tears.
The same as yours with every change you play.
By Carole King and David Palmer
I know my daddy's with me right to the end
I believe in salvation.
I don't doubt what I've found
My baby calls me late Friday night
He sounds so crazy but he feels so right
I've been coming unwound
He seeks that sheltered nest
Like the sailor's lost horizon
He needs some place to rest
The songs that he's been singing
No longer make much sense
They've killed his confidence
She sails away upon a sea of song
When his tired voice is broken
His golden hope is gone
She makes a lost soul's simple longing
He was strong but he was taken
By the thought of his success
Those spotlight shadows how they lured him
And took him like all the rest
But that old dream don't look good now
No it don't seem quite the same
He needs to hear a tender word
Won't you sing him home again
She sails away upon a sea of songs
When his strength is slowly going
His pride is all but gone
She makes a foolish dreamer listen
You better believe me
Tea for Two and Two for Tea
There's a space between us
You've been there for me
But now I feel a boundary has been drawn
I can see from all you do
That you still care for me
I know the feeling hasn't gone
But there's a space between us
A place that I can't go
Unless you step across and meet me halfway
We've been friends for much too long
And the feeling's much too strong
Reach out and make the space between us go away
I know a little bit of space between two friends
But once in a while we need to touch
The way that people should
Cause you know I've been there
But I've been working on a way to love
And still be free to care
And I know just what you're thinking
Was a time I used to be just where you are
But since I've found my freedom
And I've finally let it sink in
The distance isn't very far
There's a space between us
A place that I can't go
Unless you step across and meet me halfway
We've been friends for much too long
And the feeling's much too strong
Reach out and make the space between us go away
Feeling the warmth as the flames grow higher
I think it's true that nothing
Is really new under the sun
Watching a new love grow
From old love's embers
Yesterday's gone but today remembers
Doesn't it seem to come down the same for everyone
Everything else illusion
Adding to the confusion of the way we connive
Tracing a line till we can define
The thing that allows us to feel
Childhood dreams like muddy waters
Flowing through me to my son and daughters
Everything I ever thought is confirmed as truth to me
Even as I see the way that I want to go now
Still I had wished I had known what I know now
Maybe I could have spared you
Giving your youth to me
Everything else illusion
Adding to the confusion of the way we connive
Tracing a line till we can define
The thing that allows us to feel
When you're down and troubled
And you need some love and care
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Now ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
And take your soul if you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
I've loved you for so long
I never dreamed you'd put me in a song
And I live in Tennessee
I never hoped that you'd remember me
My pulse skipped a beat
My heart felt so heavy
Like I had too much to eat
Then you took me walking in the moonlight
I had too much molasses
And your lips stuck to mine
There's nothing left to do
The weather here has been as nice as it can be
Although it doesn't really matter much to me
For all the fun I'll have while you're so far away
It might as well rain until September
I don't need sunny skies for thing I like to do
As far as I'm concerned each day's a rainy day
So It might as well rain until September
My friends look forward to their picnics on the beach
Yes everybody loves the summertime
But you know darling while your arms are out of reach
The summer isn't any friend of mine
I'm only living for the day you're home to stay
So It might as well rain until September
If I think I'm gonna have a chocolate sundae
And when I get to the door of the ice cream store
Sitting down on the sidewalk
I feel like I'm gonna cry
You can call me silly but I don't think I am
I'm disappointed disappointed
I didn't get what I wanted
I might get over it someday
But for now I think I'll stay
Disappointed that's all
Shelly's coming over for a play date and I can't wait
But just before the doorbell rings
The telephone does and it brings
Shelly's mom says she's not coming
She's come down with the flu
We were gonna have some fun but now there's
I didn't get what I wanted
I might get over it someday
But for now I think I'll stay
Disappointed that's all
Woke up yesterday and it was snowing
I lay in bed and realized I was a little bit surprised
Because the place that I was going
Wasn't circus it was school
Instead of being angry I was happy I was cool
This time I got what I wanted
I didn't know it at first
Then I jumped up with a burst
I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All my sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain
If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you so though
The heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain
Could never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I look for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
You'll never see me complain
Never feels the least bit sorry when he treats me cruel
When the boy you love so much turns out to be so bad
When the boy you love so much turns out to be so bad
And though it really hurts me so
There's something that I've gotta say
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
Just let your love surround her
Paint a rainbow all around her
Don't let her see a cloudy sky
Once upon a time that little girl was mine
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
That's a question I'm still unable to answer
How many lies can you can you count when you just can't sleep at
That's a question I'm still unable to answer
There's just no end to all the broken promises that I recall
I was a fool to fall for you
It hurts to know you played a game and went and had yourself a ball
And through it all made me blue
That's a question I'm still unable to answer
That's a question I'm still unable to answer
If you want to give your heart
Don't be afraid to try
Love is like a boomerang
It comes right back to you
You've got a need for company
Someone you know will be there
Don't let your bruised and battered soul deny it
My scars are plain to see
But love's been good to me
And I know it's because I was willing to try it
So if you want to love again
Don't hesitate any more
Love is like a boomerang
It comes right back to you
Mountains are there for you to climb
People are doing it all the time
You can make it to the top if you make your attempt a strong one
So if you want to give your heart
Don't be afraid to try
Love is like a boomerang
It comes right back to you
Comes right back to you
They're always writing songs about a summer love
That never seems to last beyond the fall
But I've a different reason for crying this season
The reason that can hurt you most of all
I didn't have any summer romance
Nobody bothered to break my heart in two
While others were fooled by the sweet words someone vowed
I was the one who made company a crowd
I didn't walk down the beach in a trance
Or listen to little white lies that sounded true
And no one could be as blue as I was in the fall
No one could be as blue as I was in the fall
You gotta give me some
Now I'm not a greedy girl
I don't need the world
Now I don't expect you to guarantee
Your faith and devotion to only me
I'm aware you got a lot of wild oats to sow
But baby when I need you
You gotta give me some
Now I'm not a jealous child
I know a man likes to feel that he's been around
Before he decides to settle down
Some day you're gonna feel that way too
You gotta give me some
Now I'm not a greedy girl
I don't need the world
I tried to hang on for as long as I could
But now I can see that it just ain't no good
Our love it has wasted
Right down to the core
We don't have anymore
You've got to get off a road to nowhere
You've got to get off a road to nowhere
Well I tried and I tried to make things work out right
But I guess we're two people who can't help but fight
Your eyes they are open
We both need our freedom
Don't you think it's about time
I'm trying to get off this road to nowhere
I'm trying to get off this road to nowhere
Thank you for the good times we've had in the past
But we both know enough to know good times don't last
Baby you're just no good for me
And I'm no good for you
We both know what to do
We've got to get off this road to nowhere
It's time to get off this road to nowhere
You've got to get off this road to nowhere
You gotta give me some
Now I'm not a greedy girl
I don't need the world
Now I don't expect you to guarantee
Your faith and devotion to only me
I'm aware you got a lot of wild oats to sow
But baby when I need you
You gotta give me some
Now I'm not a jealous child
I know a man likes to feel that he's been around
Before he decides to settle down
Some day you're gonna feel that way too
You gotta give me some
Now I'm not a greedy girl
I don't need the world
Till the stars are in the sky
And every night when we can be together
Time just seems to hurry by
You made the world the way you thought it should be
Everything just feels so fine
Takes away that man of mine
I feel the earth move under my feet
Whenever you're around
Mellow as the month of May
I feel the earth move under my feet
Whenever you're around
And you tenderly call my name
I know that my emotions
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
Sometimes I wonder if I'm ever gonna make it home again
It's so far and out of sight
I really need someone to talk to and nobody else
Knows how to comfort me tonight
Chills my soul right to the marrow
Chills my soul right to the marrow
Sweeter than a honeycomb
And that you still love me after all this time
You bring music to my soul
Sweeter and longer and stronger
With each and every passing day
Because it's still so good after all this time
That you could make a tiger tame
Fill a desert full of rain
Bring me joy when I'm in pain
And even on the coldest winter day
For the warmth and the light and the love you give me
To me it's like an early spring
Although you see the world
Sometimes I can touch upon
The wonders that you see
And pictures you've designed
So glad you are a child of mine
So glad you are a child of mine
You don't need direction
You know which way to go
And I don't wanna hold you back
I just wanna watch you grow
You don't have to look behind
So glad you are a child of mine
Nobody's gonna steal your dreams
Or tell you how to live your life
But you'll change their heads when they see you smile
The times you were born in
But you can make the times to come
I know you will be honest
If you can't always be kind
So glad you are a child of mine
So glad you are a child of mine
As long as you've got to travel
First time out is a heavy feeling
White clouds under my feet
Sailing along like a south wind
Of peace and love and war
I still don't have an answers
But I don't get high anymore
As long as you've got to travel
And some folks gotta be still
Don't let it get you there's joy in either
So don't what you will
Just you and me and easy
As long as you've got to travel
Your toy balloon has sailed in the sky
But now it must fall to the ground
Now your sad eyes reveal
Just how badly you feel
The view from the cliffs must have been exciting
And up to the peaks you were bound
Now you're stranded alone
And the path is unknown
And there is no easy way down
When you're left on your own
When each road you take
And there's no one to break your fall
And lead you back home
Where our fantasy world can be found
But you must know in the end
When it's time to descend
There is no easy way down
You know you're gonna find
Whispering wind came uninvited
Looking for somewhere else to go
Here is a lamp I've left unlighted
Memory's flame is soon ignited
Lighting my lamp with amber glow
Quietly friends are reunited
Who just can't be happy
And be glad you can feel enough to cry
Bringing me brand new seeds to sow
Now that they've been a long time planted
If it had been as I intended
I wouldn't have the peace I know
Loving the people I've befriended
Singing a song of long ago
Loving the people I've befriended
High on a snow covered mountain
From her throne she looks down at the clowns
Who think youth can be found in a fountain
High on the wings of her rhythms
She will smile at the guys who come on with their eyes
But she'll never dance with them
And in smoke filled rooms of electric sound
A legend is built around... The Snow Queen
You may believe you're a winner
But with her you'll soon bite the dust
And discover you're just a beginner
You may not think you're a loser
You trip on your tongue
And it'll only amuse her
In the morning haze you are frozen there
Caught in the icy stare of The Snow Queen
No my friend she doesn't want what you're selling
And into the night you'll fade knowing you lost the game
For a little confrontation.
He didn't think about the noose.
He couldn't take no more abuse
So he shot down the congregation.
You can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand.
Stood for law and order.
He called for the guard to come
And surround the border.
To clean up the streets
You can't talk to a man
When he don't wanna understand.
The account of the capture
With a shotgun in his hand.
A shotgun in his hand.
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're just time away
Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again could only do me good
Can't say much of anything that's new
If I could only work this life out my way
But you're so far away
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're so far away
I sure do hope the road don't come to own me
There's so many dreams I've yet to find
But you're so far away
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't help to know you're so far away
Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
There'll be good times again for me and you
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
Was a time I remember
Hope flashed and went dim
When assassins just happened
To do the right people in
And love was a slogan
And they told us they'd work it out
In the swing of changing times
A man cried out for his
And every politician said
He was telling us like it is
And they told us they'd work it out
I see the choking cities
I see them tearing up this earth
That their lives have little worth
And I know that the future
Depends on you and me
I hope we can work it out
I hope we can work it out
Is a place that I know
Where I can find shelter
From a hunger and cold
That's where I'm bound
I know when I get there
The first thing I'll see
Is the sun shining golden
Shining right down on me
Then trouble's gonna lose me
Worry leave me behind
And I'll stand up proudly
In true peace of mind
Is a place I have seen
In a garden of wisdom
From some long ago dream
To the land where the honey runs
That's where I'm bound
You've got to get up every morning
With a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
That you're beautiful as you feel
I've got nothing to do but watch the passersby
Mirrored in their faces I see frustration growing
You've got to get up every morning
With a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
That you're beautiful as you feel
I have often asked myself for reason for sadness
In a world where tears are just a lullaby
You've got to get up every morning
With a smile in your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
When you're down and troubled
And you need some love and care
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Now ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
And take your soul if you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
But your love was the key to my peace of mind
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm living for
Close to you you make me feel so alive
You know you make me feel
High on a snow covered mountain
From her throne she looks down at the clowns
Who think youth can be found in a fountain
High on the wings of her rhythms
She will smile at the guys who come on with their eyes
But she'll never dance with them
And in smoke filled rooms of electric sound
A legend is built around... The Snow Queen
You may believe you're a winner
But with her you'll soon bite the dust
And discover you're just a beginner
You may not think you're a loser
You trip on your tongue
And it'll only amuse her
In the morning haze you are frozen there
Caught in the icy stare of The Snow Queen
No my friend she doesn't want what you're selling
And into the night you'll fade knowing you lost the game
How come you wanna leave me here
You say you got to get on along
And tell me you'll send for the rest
Is it something that I said
Or is it just your style that after a while
You've got to get up and get
How come you wanna leave me here
To work it out all on my own
Is there something else I should know
You may think it's strange
I never noticed the change
That made you wanna get up and go
He offered me the property
Show me around the pastures of plenty
Deliver me from the rivers of none
I'm about to be drowned
And my cup is so empty
Just let me know when my time is come
The bills were all for me
It's not that I mind owing up
Take me on down to the pastures of plenty
Deliver me from the rivers of none
I'm about to be drowned
And my cup is so empty
Just let me know when my time is come
The sun is setting slowly
Descending to the west
I'm prepared if the end is near
But which descent is best
Show me around the pastures of plenty
Deliver me from the rivers of none
I'm about to be drowned
And my cup is so empty
Just let me know when my time is come
Show me around the pastures of plenty
Deliver me from the rivers of none
I'm about to be drowned
And my cup is so empty
With the music of life
My soul is out of tune
And I feel like I'm growing old
My love I just couldn't compare
And the key to my happiness
Now I'm a man without a dream
I've got a heart that has no home
All my senses are numb
Losing you I've become
A man without a dream
Instead of striving to reach my goals in life
For just an illusion I traded love that was real
Now my eyes cannot see and my heart cannot feel
Now I'm a man without a dream
I've got a heart that has no home
All my senses are numb
Losing you I've become
A man without a dream
Sometimes I think I'm a prisoner of fate
Doomed to find out things a little too late
And so I must play this broken man's role
And bring back my soul
Now I'm a man without a dream
I've got a heart that has no home
All my senses are numb
Losing you I've become
Out in the woods and I'm lost again
Stranded in the wilderness with no sense of direction
I do have a prayer but I don't stand a chance
Down in the swamp I'm stuck in the sand
Thinking while I'm sinking there must be some connection
I'll twist the future lock but in the final trance
Who takes the role for granted
But people go and lose control
And try to take advantage
Out on the street with my doubts and my plan
I've thought it through and I've come to one conclusion
I'll make the best of everything and leave the rest to chance
You told me that you had to go
You said you could not stay here
That being here just made you sad
And you miss the pretty things you had
So what am I to tell you
And what's that secret sorrow that you're carrying
You said you were not born to win
But I don't think you mean it
That you think you'd better live alone
And gather people one by one
Will you turn and face my window
And what's that secret sorrow that you're carrying
As the day begins to fade
Into seeing faces on the wall
Old memories that you recall
And you're afraid you'll lose them all
And the promises they made you
And what's that secret sorrow that you're carrying
If the thoughts in my head could reach a great distance
And somehow get into your mind
They'd tell you much more than all the words I could speak
From now till the end of time
Do you like the one your beauty's been sold to
How does it feel when he holds you
As you reap the sad harvest of wanting too much
Determined you still feel alive
Now and then looking back to all you've forsaken
Nothing to do but survive
Do you like the one your beauty's been sold to
How does it feel when he holds you
You're coming on strong now
You think you're the one
You think you're the one that can change all the seasons
But you're giving me reasons not to believe it
I can hear everything you say
You come on so sweetly
You understand me completely
And I don't believe it
Taking it lightly but it's not very likely
Looking for you and the things that you do
You've got all the equipment and you know
You're aware of the fact that the boys call you foxy
You say that you're sincere
You come on so sweetly
You understand me completely
But I don't believe it
And I don't believe it
And all the funny people who were with me
Taking with them yesterday
And other things I could do without
Didn't you smile at me
Didn't you laugh at me
When you first knew I wanted you
And I've been thinking what you thought about
All my time belongs to you
Waking up and finding me
I'm where I want to be
If this is all I ever know
I'll never have a reason to complain
Didn't you smile at me
Didn't you laugh at me
The inner sun begins to shine
And soon you'll stop believing in the rain
All my time belongs to you
There was trouble in my mind tonight
Something inside didn't feel quite right
Then I saw your face in the moonlight and I was right beside you
Don't need words that we used to use
It goes deeper then the words we choose
You can't loose I wanna spread the news you got a love inside you
Some days it's hard to know what your feeling
I've been down that road before
I can't stop believing
Love makes the world go round
As long as you're a part of me
Last winter when the snow fall hit
Cold city it was hard to commit
You were out there looking for the perfect fit and I was right beside you
Nothing real comes over night
You weren't sure if it felt right
But sometimes a love can move your life if you let it guide you
Baby you've got to take love where you can find it
Just walk right through that door
I can't stop believing
Love makes the world go round
Gonna make it happen together
I can't stop believing
Love makes the world go round
The sun is shining but not on me
What's the use in making plans
But there's a voice down deep inside me telling me what to say
Don't you know that you can do anything
You can take anything and make it your own
Don't you know that you can do anything
And you don't have to do it alone
Searching for the girl I was
When I was sure and strong
When everything was easier
And I could do no wrong
If I could only believe in myself
I know I could find a way
Don't you know that you can do anything
You can take anything and make it your own
Don't you know that you can do anything
And you don't have to do it alone
Sorry tears in my eyes
Got me down in confusion and doubt
I'm no different than anyone working it out
We're all working it out
Don't you know that you can do anything
You can take anything and make it your own
Don't you know that you can do anything
I was high and low and everything in between
I made a deal with the devil for an empty IOU
You are the reason I wake up every day
And sleep through the night
In the middle of the night
No more running around spinning my wheel
You came out of my dream and made it real
You are the reason I wake up every day
And sleep through the night
In the middle of the night
I'm going down because I want you
You are the reason I wake up every day
And sleep through the night
I didn't want to go the way I'd gone before
So we could just play around
We wouldn't get serious or mysterious
When it's done it would just be done
You read me like a book
You took me over and over again
And you turned my head around
I found I didn't know what I thought I knew
I was caught up in you so fast
I want to make every moment last
Play the game you said you'd never play
I don't know if it's hot in Texas
And I don't know if it's cold in Hell
I don't know if God is watching
I just know that I love you
Trade my shoes for a simple soul
Throw away your burnt sienna
Sticks and stones get gone in a hurry
And if everybody had someone to care about
I don't care who's in the World Series
Or who does what in their own bedroom
News is blues and it doesn't really matter
When my friends told me you had someone new
I didn't believe a single word was true
I showed them all I had a faith in you
I just kept on saying
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies
My mama told me when rumors spread
There's truth somewhere and I should use my head
But I didn't listen to what she said
I kept right on saying
You're not like those other boys
Who play with hearts like they were toys
But I am sure it didn't mean a thing
And I'm so glad that I kept on saying
We go together just like summer and spring
They're all jealous of the love you bring
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies
Do you know that you know me like nobody else
All of my secrets and lies
Do you know that you made me believe in myself
Made me believe I could fly
All the things that you say
That I wait for each day
You're almost too good to be true
A stranger out of the blue
That I gave my heart up to
Well you just never know when
When love is about to begin
Something about someone reaching out
And letting someone in
And I'm glad I was there
We both had nothing to do
A stranger out of the blue
That I gave my heart up to
One day we'll find out
Why you were sent to me
It must be the way it was meant to be
A stranger out of the blue
That I gave my heart up to
Yesterday was a perfect day
In your eyes I was number one
And you were all the world to me
But you have another life
You're going to somewhere I don't belong
I can't think about Monday
I can't think about watching you walk away
I only want to be with you
I just want to be with you
I can't think about anything else but Sunday
I only want to be with you
I can't think about Monday without you
Waiting for a reason why
I know that it's over
But I don't want to hear you say goodbye
I can't think about watching you walk away
I only want to be with you
I just want to be with you
I can't think about anything else but Sunday
I only want to be with you
I can't think about Monday without you
I can't think about watching you walk away
I only want to be with you
I just want to be with you
I can't think about anything else but Sunday
I only want to be with you
Why do we isolate each other
All the walls we build between us
Make it so hard to be together
How can we tear at one another
When the thing we have in common
So why can't we reach across the line
Here on two sides of the truth
We've a middle ground in common
We have an uncommon love
So why can't we reach across the line
When will we ever learn
That the thing we have in common
We have an uncommon love
You don't have to wear the weight of the
World on your shoulders
You keep on giving everyone
So much more than your share
But you need someone you can hold on to
I will comfort you when your hope has disappeared
When you're down and out and you're in despair
All I want to do is let down my guard
Laugh like a child and play out in the yard
I want to feel safe again
Wish I could not feel the cold wind blow
I want to feel safe again
If only I could believe everything will soon be
Like all the fairy tales I've read
But I feel so lost and naked
And I wake up with the shape of a dream
All I want to do is let down my guard
I want to feel safe again
I want to feel safe again
I go through the motions of being with people
I know we speak every night
It feels like an ocean of time we're apart
I know that I've said it before
But this time when I come home
This time's the last time that I'm gonna go
Just close your eyes and imagine me home again
This time I mean to stay
I promise you this time I'll do whatever it takes
To stay right by your side
Gotta keep our emotions under control
It won't be easy to do
I mean every word I say
This time I mean to stay
Celebrate your day in style
Tonight I want to see you smile
The best is yet to come
Happy Birthday to you
The good things I could say about you are infinite
But I will only take a minute
To say the world is a better place with you in it
You know just how to be
I'm glad you're you with me
Every time I ever reach out for you
You never let me down
Any time you're ever in need of a friend
I will always be around
You are everything that's good
You are everything that matters
I would give you the world if I could
You will always be a part of me and all that I go through
May all your dreams come true
I love you and it's Christmas
And I don't know what to do
That I can't give to you
It makes me sad to think of you
Going without this year
While others all around you
Celebrate with Christmas cheer
There is so much that you wish for
That I wish that I could buy
If only I could be the one
To fill your stocking high
I wanna give you everything
But all that I can do
Is give you love for Christmas
To last the whole year through
Maybe next year with a miracle
Of that you can be sure
I'm so grateful for the small things
Every Christmas card I read
In the morning when I see you smile
You're all the gift I need
I wanna give you everything
But all that I can give
Is give you love for Christmas
I will give you love for Christmas
I will give you love for Christmas
Loving you the way I do
I know we're gonna make it through
And I would go to the ends of the earth
Anywhere that you tell me to
I will follow where you lead
If you're out on the road
Feeling lonely and so cold
All you have to do is call my name
And I'll be there on the next train
Anywhere that you tell me to
I will follow where you lead
I always wanted a real home with flowers on the window sill
Anywhere that you tell me to
Anywhere that you tell me to
Getting off the freeway
Shaking off a bad day
Got to change the feeling
And it doesn't matter how
Pulling in the driveway
I can't wait to hold you
And it doesn't matter now
I go to kiss you on the shoulder
You've got to tell me what you're thinking
We've got to put our hearts together
Standing in the kitchen
Just passed the doorway
I reach out to touch you
But you just turn away
I wanna make you happy
And I'll do it your way
We can't go on this way
Everyday we're both a little older
You've got to tell me what you're thinking
We've got to put our hearts together
Take a look at these two hearts
Everyday we're both a little older
You've got to tell me what you're thinking
We've got to put our hearts together
There was trouble in my mind tonight
Something inside didn't feel quite right

All I want to do is let down my guard
I want to feel safe again
I want to feel safe again
Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
There'll be good times again for me and you
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
And sometimes the blues get a hold of you
All around the block people will talk
But I want to give it all that I got
Sure does appeal to me
You know we can get there easily
Just like a sailboat sailing on the sea
And most times you choose between the two
But I'll have some kids and make my plans
And I'll watch the seasons running away
Sure does appeal to me
You know we can get there easily
He can sing you into paradise or bring you to your knees.
A song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified.
The same as yours with every change you play.
It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul.
He can fill a room with sadness as he fills his horn with tears.
The same as yours with every change you play.
I feel the earth move under my feet
Whenever you're around
Mellow as the month of May
I feel the earth move under my feet
Whenever you're around
And you tenderly call my name
I know that my emotions
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
When my friends told me you had someone new
I didn't believe a single word was true
I showed them all I had a faith in you

And I'm so glad that I kept on saying
We go together just like summer and spring
They're all jealous of the love you bring
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies
Of love is in your eyes
You say that I'm the only one
And I won't ask again
When you're down and troubled
And you need some love and care
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Now ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
And take your soul if you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
But your love was the key to my peace of mind
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm living for
Close to you you make me feel so alive
You know you make me feel
But I love you like no other
I've been watching everything you do
And I've been wishing only good for you
All you've got to do is just want it to
But I love you like no other
You have always been so good to me
And though you didn't always talk to me
And I don't believe you need
You know I love you like no other
Downtown anywhere in the USA
Put your money on a number anyone can play
Come on and tell us all about what happened to you today
After a hard day's work I guarantee
There just isn't anywhere better to be
If you're unable to find good company
You can always sit down and watch the color TV
And if you're feeling just a little bit lonely
Don't sit at home just hoping
Come on down to where the spirits flow so free
You know that door is always open
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're just time away
Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again could only do me good
Can't say much of anything that's new
If I could only work this life out my way
But you're so far away
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're so far away
I sure do hope the road don't come to own me
There's so many dreams I've yet to find
But you're so far away
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't help to know you're so far away
It's going to take some time this time
To get myself in shape.
I really missed the gate.
And I'll find some harmony.
And I can't make demands.
I'll learn how to bend.
And it's going to take some time this time.
No matter what I've planned.
I'll learn how to bend.
And I'm on the road again
He seeks that sheltered nest
Like the sailor's lost horizon
He needs some place to rest
The songs that he's been singing
No longer make much sense
They've killed his confidence
She sails away upon a sea of song
When his tired voice is broken
His golden hope is gone
She makes a lost soul's simple longing
He was strong but he was taken
By the thought of his success
Those spotlight shadows how they lured him
And took him like all the rest
But that old dream don't look good now
No it don't seem quite the same
He needs to hear a tender word
Won't you sing him home again
She sails away upon a sea of songs
When his strength is slowly going
His pride is all but gone
She makes a foolish dreamer listen
All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
Anytime my little world is blue
I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be
Some kind of wonderful
I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness
Is so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
Music is playing inside my head
Over and over and over again
But the music keeps playing
And won't let the cold get me down.
Pictures are forming inside my brain
Soon with the colors they'll rain together and grow
But the music keeps playing
And won't let the world get me down.
Music is playing inside
Music is playing inside
Music is playing inside
Green fields and rolling hills
Room enough to do what we will
Are running though my mind
Of a place I left behind
I've been to Canaan and I wanna go back again
Though I'm content with myself
Sometimes I long to be somewhere else
I try to do what I can
But with our day to day demands
We all need a promised land
And it's been so long
I can't remember when
I've been to Canaan and I wanna go back again
With a fireplace burning to warm me
But I've been to Canaan and I wanna go back again
Feeling the warmth as the flames grow higher
I think it's true that nothing
Is really new under the sun
Watching a new love grow
From old love's embers
Yesterday's gone but today remembers
Doesn't it seem to come down the same for everyone
Everything else illusion
Adding to the confusion of the way we connive
Tracing a line till we can define
The thing that allows us to feel
Childhood dreams like muddy waters
Flowing through me to my son and daughters
Everything I ever thought is confirmed as truth to me
Even as I see the way that I want to go now
Still I had wished I had known what I know now
Maybe I could have spared you
Giving your youth to me
Everything else illusion
Adding to the confusion of the way we connive
Tracing a line till we can define
The thing that allows us to feel
As long as you've got to travel
First time out is a heavy feeling
White clouds under my feet
Sailing along like a south wind
Of peace and love and war
I still don't have an answers
But I don't get high anymore
As long as you've got to travel
And some folks gotta be still
Don't let it get you there's joy in either
So don't what you will
Just you and me and easy
As long as you've got to travel
I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All my sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain
If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you so though
The heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain
Could never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I look for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
You'll never see me complain
The weather here has been as nice as it can be
Although it doesn't really matter much to me
For all the fun I'll have while you're so far away
It might as well rain until September
I don't need sunny skies for thing I like to do
As far as I'm concerned each day's a rainy day
So It might as well rain until September
My friends look forward to their picnics on the beach
Yes everybody loves the summertime
But you know darling while your arms are out of reach
The summer isn't any friend of mine
I'm only living for the day you're home to stay
So It might as well rain until September
Welcome to my living room
Not a June bride or the December groom
We'll be playing at a reasonable volume here
I'm gonna play some songs for you
And there's so many I'd like to do
But I'll try to do all I can in the time they give me
And make this night about songwriting
Sing and play some favorite tunes...
Looking out my window
Peace in the valley just don't come
Though I know that man's my brother
The hour is getting later
It's time we had begun
But the race must still be run
Take care of little jealousies
And talk that kills for fun
And hold your heart in readiness
It's so easy to come undone
But I think I saw a brand new light
Coming over the horizon
Brighter than all the others
And it says all men are brothers under the skin
Brothers under the skin
Looking out my window
Peace in the valley just don't come
And that I'm the selfish one
And I look at other people
And I love the ones I can
Still I think I saw a brand new light
Coming over the horizon
Brighter than all the others
And it says all men are brothers under the skin
Brothers under the skin
There was trouble in my mind tonight
Something inside didn't feel quite right
Then I saw your face in the moonlight and I was right beside you
Don't need words that we used to use
It goes deeper then the words we choose
You can't loose I wanna spread the news you got a love inside you
Some days it's hard to know what your feeling
I've been down that road before
I can't stop believing
Love makes the world go round
As long as you're a part of me
Last winter when the snow fall hit
Cold city it was hard to commit
You were out there looking for the perfect fit and I was right beside you
Nothing real comes over night
You weren't sure if it felt right
But sometimes a love can move your life if you let it guide you
Baby you've got to take love where you can find it
Just walk right through that door
I can't stop believing
Love makes the world go round
Gonna make it happen together
I can't stop believing
Love makes the world go round
And the memory cuts like a knife
Didn't we find the ecstasy
Didn't we share the daylight
When you walked into my life
All the promises still unbroken
And think about all the words between us
That never needed to be spoken
We are the lucky ones
Some people never get to do
I will always think of you
Didn't we come together
Didn't we live together
Didn't we cry together
Didn't we play together
Didn't we love together
And together we lit up the world
I miss the day we met and all that followed after
Sometimes I wish I could always be with you
The way we used to do
I will always think of you
I will always be with you
Wanting you the way I do
I only wanna be with you
And I would go to the ends of the earth
Cause darling to me that's what you're worth
If you're out on the road
Feeling lonely and so cold
All you have to do is call my name
I always wanted a real home
With flowers on the windowsill
But if you wanna live in New York City
I never thought I could get satisfaction
But if anyone could keep me happy
You're the one who can
I'm gonna follow where you lead
I'm gonna follow where you lead
I'm gonna follow where you lead
I'm gonna follow where you lead
My world comes tumbling down
You'll go home again without me
Where will I go tomorrow
It doesn't matter if you want me to stay
Or should I keep on walking away
It feels so good with you
It feels so right with you
But I will bring you sorrow if I stay
I would lay down my life for you
I would lay down my life for you
I would lay down my life for you
I would lay down my life for you
When going on made no real sense at all
Now that my back is against the wall
How will you get through tomorrow
And we'll be together forever
Bound by the way we made each other feel
And I will lay down my life for you
I will lay down my life for you
Yes it feels so right with you
I will lay down my life for you
I will lay down my life for you
I will lay down my life
He can sing you into paradise or bring you to your knees.
A song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified.
The same as yours with every change you play.
It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul.
He can fill a room with sadness as he fills his horn with tears.
The same as yours with every change you play.
For a little confrontation.
He didn't think about the noose.
He couldn't take no more abuse
So he shot down the congregation.
You can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand.
Stood for law and order.
He called for the guard to come
And surround the border.
To clean up the streets
You can't talk to a man
When he don't wanna understand.
The account of the capture
With a shotgun in his hand.
A shotgun in his hand.
Like a ghost of the future hovering dark and dreamy
You fade in and out of the mist
I feel you just beyond a star
Do you know how much you are all I ever wanted
Is it too much too soon
Am I foolishly dreaming
Just baying at the moon
Playing impossible visions like an elementary tune
How I wish that I could realize my heart
And though it really hurts me so
There's something that I've gotta say
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
The weather here has been as nice as it can be
Although it doesn't really matter much to me
For all the fun I'll have while you're so far away
It might as well rain until September
You're much too hard to resist.
Hey girl now sit yourself down
I'm not ashamed to get down on the ground
And then beg you to stay
I beg you please don't go away
And you will know our love was meant to be
Of love is in your eyes
You say that I'm the only one
Meets the morning sun
And I won't ask again
And all that's left is loving you forever
Now all that's left is loving you forever
A spark that sparks one time
Like when we are together
And all that's left is loving you forever
Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
There'll be good times again for me and you
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're just time away
Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again could only do me good
Can't say much of anything that's new
If I could only work this life out my way
But you're so far away
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're so far away
I sure do hope the road don't come to own me
There's so many dreams I've yet to find
But you're so far away
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't help to know you're so far away
And sometimes the blues get a hold of you
All around the block people will talk
But I want to give it all that I got
Sure does appeal to me
You know we can get there easily
Just like a sailboat sailing on the sea
And most times you choose between the two
But I'll have some kids and make my plans
And I'll watch the seasons running away
Sure does appeal to me
You know we can get there easily
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Now believe me when I tell you
But I can't break away from all of these chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
I wanna tell you pretty baby
But I can't break away from all these chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
The local rock group down the street
Is trying hard to learn their song
Serenade the weekend squire
Who just came out to mow his lawn
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Charcoal burning everywhere
Rows of houses that are all the same
And no one seems to care
Because her roses are in bloom
He's got a TV in every room
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Here in status symbol land
Mothers complain about how hard life is
And the kids just don't understand
Creature comfort goals
They only numb my soul and make it hard for me to see
My thoughts all seem to stray to places far away
I need a change of scenery
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Charcoal burning everywhere
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Here in status symbol land
Being at war with each other
So why do we complicate our lives so much
By being at war with each other
Why do we seem to vote to dig more holes
It's such a waste of a planet
There must be a reason that I can't see
Maybe somebody else knows better than me
Everyone else is a sister or brother
So we've got to look around again and stop
I feel the earth move under my feet
Whenever you're around
Mellow as the month of May
I feel the earth move under my feet
Whenever you're around
And you tenderly call my name
I know that my emotions
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the earth move under my feet
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
But your love was the key to my peace of mind
Cause you make me feel
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm living for
Close to you you make me feel so alive
You know you make me feel
When you're down and troubled
And you need some love and care
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Now ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
And take your soul if you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Come on baby do the locomotion
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
Come on baby do the locomotion
My little baby sister can do it with ease
It's easier than learning your ABC's
You gotta swing your hips now
Come on baby jump up jump back
Now that you can do it let's make a chain now
Come on baby do the locomotion
Come on baby do the locomotion
Do it nice and easy now and don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
Move around the floor in a locomotion
Come on baby do the locomotion
Come on baby do the locomotion
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Door bells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into Springs
These are a few of my favorite things
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad.

Ring ting tingling too
Outside the snow is falling
For a sleigh ride together with you.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land.
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
For a sleigh ride together with you.
There's a birthday party
At the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs
At the fireplace while we watch
There's a happy feeling
When they pass around the chocolate
It'll nearly be like a picture print
These wonderful things are the things
Ring ting tingling too
Outside the snow is falling
For a sleigh ride together with you.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Snow cones in the sun and palm trees swaying
But we got some coconuts and rum for toasting
Don't need a snowman we'll build castles in the sand
I'm in a Christmas Paradise
No need to hurry we don't have to worry there's no where else to be
But the starry sky and the Christmas lights when the sun sets on the sea
I'm in a Christmas Paradise
You and me in Christmas Paradise
You and me in Christmas Paradise
I'm in Christmas Paradise with you
You and me in Christmas Paradise
You and me in Christmas Paradise
It's Christmas time and I'm in Paradise
We won't miss the snow at all
Every day will be like a holiday with my baby
When my baby comes home
She's been alone such a long time
Every day will be like a holiday with my baby
When my baby comes home
See everybody on this holiday
I know this feeling somewhere never gonna go away
Every day will be like a holiday with my baby
Let your heart be light
Our troubles will be out of sight
Our troubles will be miles away.
Happy golden days of yore.
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more.
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.
The snow is snowing and the wind is blowing
For I've got my love to keep me warm
I can't remember a worse December
I can't remember a worse December
Christmas time in the middle of a city
Seeking its salvation
With every string of lights
That suddenly appears
Children stare with new found wonder
No one dares to break the trance
Every wish is carefully numbered
And God has granted all a second chance
And as we mark the old year's passing
And suddenly there's goodwill everywhere
There's Christmas in the air
We still wait for you
And now the time has come
When all the world is one
And as we mark the old year's passing
And suddenly there's goodwill everywhere
There's Christmas in the air
There comes a time when we're on our own
Some times in life such a thing must be
But such a thing should not be known
And now the time has come
And now the time has come
And now the time has come
And now the time has come
And now the time has come
And all the world is one
And as we mark the old year's passing
And suddenly there's goodwill everywhere
There's Christmas in the air
The final letter that she read
Was from a younger man
It came with a journal
That was all written by hand
He had done something so wrong in life
That he no longer wished to live
But on this night he had a dream
And found that God forgives
If we truly regret how others we have hunt
So he took the message from this night
Said the night man to the little lamb
Do you see what I see
Do you see what I see
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
Do you hear what I hear
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea
Said the shepherd boy the mighty king
Do you know what I know
Do you know what I know
Let us bring him silver a gold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Said the king to the people everywhere
Sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together
The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you
Lights twinkle all around
But your eyes outshine the town
The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
This Christmas will be
The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
Hang all the mistletoe
I'm going to get to know you better
A very special Christmas for me
Hang all the mistletoe
I'm going to get to know you better
Everybody makes a dream this time of year
From now on it's gonna be good for you
All your friends and family
It's a time to remember your blessings
It's a time to remember your goals
All the people in your life
Be they new friends or old
And it could be the time of your life
Keep everything they gave you
You walk with them each and everyday
And I know sometimes the road isn't easy
And we've said something we'd never wished to say
Once a few rounds you loved and lost
You pick yourself up and take a chance again
And it could be the time of your life
And we'll sway along with the band
May all your dreams come true
And it could be the time of your life
Everybody makes a dream this time of year
From now on it's gonna be good for you
All your friends and family
It's a time to remember your blessings
It's a time to remember your goals
All the people in your life
Be they new friends or old
And it could be the time of your life
Keep everything they gave you
You walk with them each and everyday
And I know sometimes the road isn't easy
And we've said something we'd never wished to say
Once a few rounds you loved and lost
You pick yourself up and take a chance again
And it could be the time of your life
And we'll sway along with the band
May all your dreams come true
And it could be the time of your life
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
But you're the key to my peace of mind
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel like
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
And if I make you happy I don't need to do more
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel like
You make me feel so good inside
And I just wanna be close to you
You make me feel so alive
You make me feel like
I tried to hang on for as long as I could
But now I can see that it just ain't no good
Our love it has wasted
Right down to the core
We don't have anymore
You've got to get off a road to nowhere
You've got to get off a road to nowhere
Well I tried and I tried to make things work out right
But I guess we're two people who can't help but fight
Your eyes they are open
We both need our freedom
Don't you think it's about time
I'm trying to get off this road to nowhere
I'm trying to get off this road to nowhere
Thank you for the good times we've had in the past
But we both know enough to know good times don't last
Baby you're just no good for me
And I'm no good for you
We both know what to do
We've got to get off this road to nowhere
It's time to get off this road to nowhere
You've got to get off this road to nowhere
Never feels the least bit sorry when he treats me cruel
When the boy you love so much turns out to be so bad
When the boy you love so much turns out to be so bad
Funny how I feel more myself with you
Than anybody else that I ever knew
You've become a memory I can't erase
You could have been anyone at all
A stranger falling out of the blue
I'm so glad it was you
Suddenly a miracle came to me
Safe within your arms I can say what's true
Nothing in the world I would keep from you
You could have been anyone at all
An old friend calling out of the blue
I'm so glad it was you
Words can hurt you if you let them
People say them and forget them
But your words make me feel like I can fly
You could have been anyone at all
And that's what catches me when I fall
I'm so glad it was you
You could have been anyone at all
An old friend falling out of the blue
I'm so glad it was you
You could have been anyone at all
To think of how I call you up
To talk about all the little things
You listened to all I dreamed of
The good old fashioned kind.
You who kept me strong
I wonder how I could've been so blind
Loved me like a friend
And I'm in love for the last time.
I got a second chance.
We might have spent the years ahead
Believing love had passed
I found a love to last a lifetime
And time will make it last.
You who kept me strong
I don't know how I could've been so blind.
Loved me like a friend
And I'm in love for the last time
I've loved you for so long
You'd put me in a song.
I never hoped that you'd remember me.
My heart felt so heavy
Like I had too much to eat.
I had too much molasses
And your lips stuck to mine.
He said if I play them I will surely die.
There's nothing left to do.
Never been the kind to stay at home
Even when I'm feeling down
So every night I go out on the town
But every night I find
It's not as easy as I thought it would be
To dance you out of my mind
I can't control my emotions
Ever since we said our goodbyes
Now anything can happen in this day and age
Just take a look at me
My body keeps moving to the happy beat
While my spirit's in misery
You can't see it with the strobe lights flashing
But there's a whole different picture you'll see of me
When you get a look at my face
I can't control my emotions
Ever since we said our goodbyes
Your love was the key to my peace of mind
And when my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
You make me feel so good inside
I'm not supposed to be alone with you.
But our lips must never meet.
You're much too hard to resist.
It'll never work out.
You're much too hard to resist.
Before I beg you to stay.
He loves her when she's sleeping
And all the dreams she's keeping
Makes me wanna sing it to you a new found treasure
They had the good kind of love.
A little bit of loving and a kissing and a hugging
That's how they fell in love
She's the kind of girl who's not too shy
And I can tell I'm her kind of guy
She danced close to me like I hoped she would
We only danced for a minute or two
But then she stuck close to me the whole night through
I walked her home and she held my hand
So I asked to see her next week and she told me I could
What would I do if I didn't have you
To wake up to each day
Who'd take my troubles and put them in bubbles
And make them burst away
And where would I find the innocence
That tells me it's okay
If I didn't have you to wake up to each day
Your father's going to be a little bit jealous
When the boys come around to call
And when you don't come home on time
He'll be pacing up and down the hall
But that's just a part of growing up
What could I do anyway
If I didn't have you to wake up to each day
Should I teach you discipline
You'll learn it from within
I know that every mother thinks her child
But you've got a smile that can't be refused
It even brightens up the sun
I wish I could make time stand still and
But that's something even Old Methuselah wasn't able to do
I hope you come around to see me
If I didn't have you to wake up to each day
It's going to take some time this time
To get myself in shape
I really fell out of line this time
I really missed the gate
The birds on the telephone line
And I won't be so blind next time
And I'll find some harmony
But it's going to take some time this time
And I can't make demands
But like the young trees in the wintertime
I'll learn how to bend
After all the tears we've spent
So it's one more round for experience
And I'm on the road again
And it's going to take some time this time
It's going to take some time this time
No matter what I've planned
And like the young trees in the wintertime
I'll learn how to bend
After all the tears we've spent
So it's one more round for experience
And I'm on the road again
There's just one little dream I've got to make come true
Let me hold on to the good thing I've found
Let me hold on to the good thing I've found
That old pot of gold ain't so easy to find
Please don't leave me
I don't remember just exactly how it started
It doesn't make a bit of sense to me
Why should two people in love have to be
Like little children who don't know wrong from right
Like little children who just can't help but fight
Why should two grown people have to act
There's no storm that you and I can't weather
If we just take the time to talk it out together
And we both do things that aren't wise
Like little children who don't know wrong from right
Like little children who just can't help but fight
Why should two grown people have to act
Now I'm not saying you've got to do
Everything that I say
But you've got to realize
Let's forget about the past and look to the new horizon
Being happy together is the goal we'll keep our eyes on
Like little children who don't know wrong from right
Like little children who just can't help but fight
I remember one young sister with rainbows in her eyes
Standing on the corner with the afternoon's supply
Then she asked if I could tell her where they
Like a night this side of dying
Her day's inside the dropper on the shelf
When she hears her lifeline crying
Not a thing you say can stop her
When she just can't stop herself
The best of friends sold brothers for a
Dime of quinine dreams
Like a night this side of dying
Her day's inside the dropper on the shelf
Like the shelter she's been buying
Not a thing I've got can save her
When she just can't save herself
The days are marching forward
They fly like a hummingbird
The year is almost over
Time is all these things and worse
Let us sing before our time runs out
These things are never changing
But Monday I blink and it's Friday
I wish we could slow it down
Another week starting over
Seconds to minutes to hours
Here's what I've found
Time is all these things and worse
Let us sing before our time runs out
Time is all these things and worse
All I want is a quiet place to live
Where I can enjoy the fruits of my labor
And not have to cry out loud
In my mind I can see it crystal clear
Sharing my dreams with the people around me
And I'm just a part of the crowd
What will become of us
What about the children
What will they do to us next time around
What will the answer be
What will it mean to me
When are they gonna see we're underground
And all I want is a quiet place to live
Where I can be free in a world of my making
What they decided to give
You better believe me
I'm afraid there's no two ways about it
Now you say you need my love
But you'll just have to learn to live without it
Don't try to understand it
It never works the way you planned it
When you meant the world to me
That's the time you said you didn't want me
You played around in front of me
You did everything you could to taunt me
Don't try to analyze it
And when it dies you can't disguise it
You've made your bed and now you'll have to lie in it
There's no denying it's a shame
But there's really no one else that you can blame
Don't try to understand it
I'm on my way to somewhere through tomorrow
Would you care to walk with me today
Nowhere in particular to go
And nothing to conceal
Walk with me I'll be your companion
I may not have an awful lot to say
You can be anything you want to
And anytime you want to walk away it's okay
Chances come fortunes go
And I don't know what lies beyond the crossroad
I got no past or future on my mind
Through all my reflections one thing is plain to see
You've put these distances between us
While making love seem so unkind
I'll get over you in time
There's nothing here to hold you now
I've tried to justify your thinking
I've given in and been denied
The only thing you leave is compromise
I'll get over you in time
There's nothing here to hold you now
We left those dreams so far behind
Things get so confusing when you do
I feel so damn defeated when we're through
I'll get over you in time
There's nothing here to hold you now
I just can't fight your willful mind
But the feelings in my soul
My heart overflows with
Emotions I just can't control
There's someone you are going to
Let me be yours until tomorrow
Let me be yours until tomorrow
Give me one night of your life
Just be mine till the dawn
Tomorrow the real world
Will come crashing down on me
I know I must lose you
And that's the way it has to be
Let me be yours until tomorrow
Let me be yours until tomorrow
Give me one night of your life
Till the dawn's intrusion
Ends this sweet illusion
All I ask is one night
Till the morning sunlight
Here in my arms and baby
Let me be yours until tomorrow
You wont even notice that I'm passing through
My voice is a whisper that you hardly hear
But my perfume you remember
Do I belong to anyone or anywhere
Oh will I ever get to the end of my journey
All I know for sure is were all made
Made of the same flesh and blood
Just happens to be made in Europe
Makes me recall a memory I close my eyes
And Grand Canal turns into a Swedish lake
Seems to do wonders for my fantasy
I seem to recall Paris You and me
Oh that hand in Barcelona
Oh will I ever get to the end of my journey
All I know for sure is were all made
Made of the same flesh and blood
Just happens to be made in Europe
Will I ever get to the end of my journey
All I know for sure is were all made
Made of the same flesh and blood
Oh will I ever get to the end of my journey
All I know for sure is were all made
Made of the same flesh and blood
Made of the same flesh and blood
To hit me in the face
But can't you see that I'm only alone
So you're going to town
Have to open my mouth
And empty the contents onto the floor
But I'm never supposed to
Than I'm only several inches from the door
You say as I'm tying my shoes
Your hands nervous mess up
As they were tying your shoes
And you slipped up and have to start new
Well I would never say hurry up to you
But I won't open my mouth
Because that's just something that I wouldn't do
You've got to open your mouth
As your heading to town
And empty the contents onto the floor
But if I'm never supposed to
As you would take it out
And dreaming of the last time I saw your face
When it disappeared from the staircase
You were so pleased with yourself
But I tried I tried to kiss your cheek
When we hugged goodbye
And I tried but the lack of height
Made me kiss your neck instead
After the street signs got hazy
I stumbled the streets I was fading
Trying to act like I wasn't steep like I wasn't steep
Through your open door
But I opened them before you did
Our backs against the glass
Its hard to act like I'm asleep
I'm falling I'm falling
I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling
I'm falling out of you
I'm falling out of you
Watching over daddy's farm
From your spot in the old oak tree
In your spot that overlooks
All the flowing grains of grass and harmonies
He's gonna make it on the scene
A new Mercedes with a financed lease
While he's chasing down his dreams
A little late under those faithful trees
But little sally's stressed
Because she can't quite reach the dresser drawers or cabinets
In your spot that overlooks
She sees a thick rain and an overflowing crick
The wind is knocking at her door
But she's too little for that latching job to work
And out the door she flies
But the wind won't stain her eyes or the collars of her dress
Just in a different way
Over the Atlantic bay
She helps the sun each day
The rain on the sill has started dripping again
And you are fast asleep by ten
And now I am alone in a world of disgrace
To search for my poor mothers face in it all
And now I think six months ago I'd have climbed down his stairs
To find him in his underwear
And I'd have climbed in his bed with the blankets over our heads
Just you and me in our short sleeves
And side by side is where we decided that
You look so different with your wings
As long as you refuse to move
Just keep working it out
These babes are yours for now
In giving you the strongest bones of all of them
Just keep working it out
This is what I keep saying
To keep my shoulders strong
Hum the opening and back and forth we sway to the beat
And our raw cheeks they will melt
This is what I keep saying
To keep my shoulders strong
To keep my shoulders strong
To keep my shoulders strong
I am looking across the water where the mountains eat the trees
When the cool breeze goes
When the monster crows
When the bottom drops out
And all the big boys know
How we fighting types like to make a song hit
Make it hit hard and the blow
When the bottom drops out
When the cool breeze goes
When the monster crows
So bind up the French doors
And lace your leather tight
The eagle's nest tonight
So bind up the French doors
And lace your leather tight
The eagle's nest tonight
And I am a golden gate
My hands are married yet
But my brother sings in his sleep
Cradles a field of grain
Where my father sweats
My daughters worth is more
So bind up the French doors
And lace your leather tight
The eagle's nest tonight
So bind up the French doors
And lace your leather tight
The eagle's nest tonight
So bind up the French doors
And lace your leather tight
The eagle's nest tonight
So bind up the French doors
And lace your leather tight
The eagle's nest tonight
Little boys been coming around here
Singing in circles around my head
Singing in circles around my legs
Upright but angled at their jutted out feet
A calculate mind from the age of nine
Scholarships with the oversights
If you listen close and you hear just right
A sister's words can chew
Through a phone line buzz or little boys that cuss
And our lady girl who loved the world
But bit a jackrabbit in half
If only they were not so fast
So just remember that
So just remember that
And we are five feet tall and only skin
Tied to tired bones by veins
You are only yours to claim
You are only yours to claim
You desert me after you string me along
Little denim boy blue
I refuse to give up on you this time
They ought not to use their women like toys
I been working and treating you good
I keep trying until you hold me right
Little denim boy blue
I refuse to give up on you this time
I keep trying until you hold me right
Hoping that someday you might
I keep trying till you hold me right
Little denim boy blue
For those whose eyes would see
Render them in faith to me
For all those seeking peace
In my arms your strife shall cease
And place in me the agony you bear
The perfect love I bring
Where hollow princes and shallow kings
Perform their tricks while justice swings
And may I remind you once again
Of the spectacle about to begin
Now forming at the darkest
Don't forget to take your place in line
Leave your mind behind
And join the precession of the people
By the people and for the people
Your own wonderful parade
Your wonderful parade
Moving through the towns that rise and then they fade
Over streets that pass the houses where you've stayed
Your wonderful parade
Your daily masquerade
Paper masks that hide the faces you have made
Crumbled down upon foundations you've laid
Your daily masquerade
Meet your wife at cocktail time
Your marvelous charade
Blindness is a part of every game you played
Your marvelous parade
Meet your wife at cocktail time
Your marvelous charade
Never could be worth the prices that you've paid
Blindness is a part of every game you played
Someday rested from hours of sleeping
We'll stay safely behind what we're keeping
You'll seem warmer than I had remembered you
Lying so close I'll be able to feel you breathe
One day when I am able to love you
I'll come back from wherever I've been to
I'll see you looking the same as you always have
So I'll start to live
Someday always brings
The good life you knew
Please say that you'll be waiting when someday comes
Please say that you'll be waiting when someday comes
Love is but a song we sing
And fear's the way we die
You can make the mountains ring
Or hear the angels cry
Though the dove is on the wing
You need not know why
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Love one another right now
Some will come and some will go
This will surely pass
When the one who left us here
Returns for us at last
We are but a moment's sunlight
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Love one another right now
If you hear the song we sing
You hold the key to love and fear
It's in your trembling hand
One key unlocks them both you know
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Love one another right now
Love one another right now
All of my life I have been waiting for just one boy
And all of my life I have been waiting for all the joy
Of having someone that I can call my own
Who'll come to my side when I am all alone
And I've found a whole new world has opened for me
A world filled with joy
A world filled with all your love eternally
For you say you're mine
You'll love me all the time
And all of my life you will be my own
I just want someone that I can call my own
Who'll come to my side when I am all alone
And I've found a whole new world has opened for me
A world filled with joy
A world filled with all your love eternally
For you say you're mine
And you'll love me all the time
I guess you know what it's all about
All the answers seem so clear to you
You know just exactly what you want to do
And never allow a feeling of doubt
I guess you see where your road can lead
And all the pain that you have in store
For now you have chosen to lock every door
And find on your own what you think you need
I'll still be calling your name
And if I try to show you how
Tomorrow is never like yesterday
Would you change your mind and see things my way
I'll still be calling your name
I'll still be calling your name
I'll still be calling your name
I think I'm going to be sad
The boy that's driving me mad
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
He said that living with me
He would never be free
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
Don't know why he's riding so high
I think I'm going to be sad
The boy that's driving me mad
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
Think I'm going to be sad
Think I'm going to be sad
Think I'm going to be sad
Think I'm going to be sad
Think I'm going to be sad
Don't be afraid to love and get love returned
Don't be afraid to tell everyone you've learned
That love is a groovy thing
It knows how to make you sing
And it fills up your life with
Don't be afraid to give all you got to give
One of these days you'll find that's the way to live
And living is what we all were put on this earth to do
So come on and live and be happy
Don't be afraid to love
Love is a groovy thing
It knows how to make you sing
And it fills up your life with
Don't be afraid to give all you got to give
One of these days you'll find that's the way to live
And living is what we all were put on this earth to do
Getting away from all the things that need doing
Lazily here to lose the afternoon
It's as close to getting up as I can go
Taking the chance to free myself from my worries
Cover them well enough and no one sees
Then the only thing to do is try to cover them again
To be somebody's slave for a dime
I've got plenty of mountains I'm looking to find
It's as close to getting up as I can go
Pleasing myself is all that really needs doing
Everything else begins but never ends
To be somebody's slave for a dime
I've got plenty of mountains I'm looking to find
To be somebody's slave for a dime
I've got plenty of mountains I'm looking to find
Yesterday I thought you'd stay
I thought you'd see things my way
But now I see my hope's may be dead
I should have known when you said
I was the one you wanted
Wanting meant nothing more than today
And hope you return some day
Ever since you've gone away
Every road that I follow
Leaves me with no tomorrow
I need someone to show me the way
And hope you return some day
That you could mean what you just said
Think of what you are
How very far you are from being real
You'd really leave him
Notice how her image saddens
How lonely she's become
Just once I'd like to see her happy
Before the winter comes
The open sky is not your home
Reality is here among the stones
Thorns among the roses
Among the thorns here
Notice how her image saddens
How lonely she's become
Just once I'd like to see her happy
Before the winter comes
I wish her only good times
Just singing and a dreaming of what's in my mind
Before I can take home what's rightfully mine
Joining and listening and talking in rhymes
Stopping the feeling to wait for the times
The line isn't black if you know that it's green
Through the song we sing
We've only just begun to live
White lace and promises
A kiss for luck and we're on our way
Before the rising sun we fly
So many roads to choose
We start out walking and learn to run
Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talking it over just the two of us
And when the evening comes we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talking it over just the two of us
And when the evening comes we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
How it makes life complete
You can talk all you want
Make it sound good and sweet
But the words have an empty ring
And they don't really mean a thing
Without love you are not to be found
You are not to be found
For love is surrender
You must surrender if you care
You must surrender if you dare
And the wars will all end
But you can't cover up the past
Just pretending will never last
Without love you are nothing at all
You are nothing at all
For love is surrender
You must surrender if you care
You must surrender if you dare
For love is surrender
You must surrender if you care
You must surrender if you dare
Maybe it's just the constant rhythm of the sea
Maybe it's just that I have never been the kind
Who can pass a lucky penny by
Maybe it's you who brought the caring I forgot
Isn't it nice to talk about the special way
Rising on the shore the ocean came
Walks along the waves of velveteen
His only thought was love for me
Couldn't we stay and watch the splashing rocks we throw
Only a fool would want to leave the paradise
That I find whenever you're around
Isn't it nice to talk about the special way
Rising on the shore the ocean came
Walks along the waves of velveteen
Couldn't we stay and watch the splashing rocks we throw
Only a fool would want to leave the paradise
That I find whenever you're around
If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied
Straight faced while I cried
And still I'd look to find a reason to believe
Makes it hard to live without somebody else
If you'd took the time to change my mind
I'd find a way to leave the past behind
Knowing that you lied
Straight faced while I cried
And still I'd look to find a reason to believe
Makes it hard to live without somebody else
If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied
Straight faced while I cried
And still I'd look to find a reason to believe
Makes it hard to live without somebody else
And I you do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
And every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I need you like I've never done before
And I you do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
And I you do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Why do birds suddenly appear
Just like me they long to be
Why do stars fall down from the sky
Just like me they long to be
On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
And starlight in your eyes of blue
Just like me they long to be
On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
And starlight in your eyes of blue
Just like me they long to be
It's not the way you smile
That touches my heart
It's not the way you kiss
I sit alone at home I cry over you
What they say about you
They say you've never
It doesn't matter what they say
I'm going to love you any old way
I sit alone at home I cry over you
What do you get when you fall in love
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble
That's what you get for all your trouble
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again
What do you get when you kiss a guy
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
After you do he'll never phone you
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again
Don't tell me what is all about
That is why I'm here to remind you
What do you get when you fall in love
You get enough tears to fill an ocean
That's what you get for your devotion
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again
Don't tell me what is all about
That is why I'm here to remind you
What do you get when you fall in love
You only get lies and pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
I'll never fall in love again
Burned to October brown
Led to December's frozen ground
The seasons stumbled round
Our drifting lives are bound
To a falling crescent noon
A vale of tears to earth
No one sees a quiet mountain bird
Dressed in a brand new day
The sun is on its way
To a falling crescent noon
In a fairy tale forest
Answer that is waiting to be heard
Born like the breaking day
All our green Septembers burn away
Slowly we'll fade into
The sea of midnight blue
For there is something I've got to say
And please don't let it scare you away
I have seen you go through a day
You're everything a robot lives for
Walk in at nine and roll out the door at five
You reflect the company image
You maintain their rules to live by
Now that you're wearing a coat and tie
You've blown your life just playing a game
Where no one wins but everyone stays the same
You reflect the company image
You maintain their rules to live by
Now that you're wearing a coat and tie
You've blown your life just playing a game
Where no one wins but everyone stays the same
Please play your game
I ran away from you and left you crying
And though I'm back to stay you think I'm lying
But I've changed my ways and my wandering days are through
And through it all I kept on loving you
I'm home for good and I will never leave you
You must believe me and I will never leave you
But through it all I kept on loving you
I'm home for good and I will never leave you
You must believe me and I will never leave you
I'm home for good and I will never leave you
You must believe me and I will never leave you
I'm home for good and I will never leave you
You must believe me and I will never leave you
The moon that rose now descended
And the love one shared now had ended
And soon the day would come
And when the day had come
The light that fell at dawn was cold
The warmth of you had gone
A taste of loneliness
Cut through the earliness
And oh the wind sang of you
Leaving a cloud of sadness in my head
And though I'm buried in
A sad song of the morning wind
I know the day would bring
Another song for me to sing
But when the day had come
The light fell at dawn was cold
Talking to myself and feeling old
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
What I've got they used to call the blues
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
Nice to know somebody loves me
Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do
Run and find the one who loves me
What I feel has come and gone before
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do
Run and find the one who loves me
What I feel has come and gone before
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
Began just the same as other days
But ended up different in many ways
Love is in my world since Saturday
But somehow it didn't seem the same
The sadness of Friday had somehow changed
To the happy sounds of
I whistle to bluebirds
I tried to tell them how you brought me sunshine
My head's filled with new words
That sing to the sounds of the day after Friday
The flowers of love she gave to me
The touches of laughter and harmony
To the happy sounds of
My head's full of new words
Sing to the sounds of the day after Friday
The flowers of love she gave to me
The touches of laughter and harmony
To the happy sounds of
If you should find yourself alone
Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
When this whole world's turned upside down
Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
For love and understanding
To find a quiet place
For silent understanding
Come to me when things go wrong
And there's no love to light the way
Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
I've got to find a place to hideaway
Far from the shadows of my mind
Oh how I long to find a place to hide away
I hear you whisper and I must obey
Blindly I follow where you lead
I run through the mist of the wine
But night and the music remind me instead
The world once was mine
I'll save my pennies for a rainy day
For how I long to find a place to hide away
But night and the music remind me instead
The world once was mine
I'll save my pennies for a rainy day
Strangers in many ways
We've got a lifetime to share
And as we go from day to day
I'll feel you close to me
But time alone will tell
Let's take a lifetime to say
For only time will tell us so
Strangers in many ways
Let's take a lifetime to say
For only time will tell us so
I fell in love with you
Before the second show
It sounds so sweet and clear
But you're not really here
And I can hardly wait
And play your sad guitar
But with all the junk you wear it's hard to tell
To get your hair to look like that
I don't need a horoscope
To tell me where you're at
Your family's probably given up on you
Since you began to follow groups
Of long haired rock and rollers
I can hear your mother
Crying for her daughter
It doesn't matter after all
You're so sure instant love is all you need
I've seen your face at least a thousand times
You're always standing there behind
The stages at the concerts
To be with someone after
It isn't easy for a girl
When she can't decide if love is wrong or right
I hope I live to see a change
One love in my young life
Took me somewhere I had never been
In the shelter of his brightly woven love song
So long I have wanted love to be
Sitting just this near to me
Now my waiting heart is free
Few are the choices we are given
The sands of time pass quickly by
One dream of my young life
Now stands holding out his hand to me
Now I can't help but believe
That my whole life will be
Few are the choices we are given
The sands of time pass quickly by
One dream of my young life
Now stands holding out his hand to me
Now I can't help but believe
That my whole life will be
Let's take a lifetime to say
For only time will tell us so
Go while the going is good
Knowing when to leave may be the smartest thing anyone can learn
Fly while your still have your wings
Knowing when to leave won't ever let you reach the point of no return
I still have my dreams
Day after day as I wait for the man I need
Night after night as I wish for a love that can be
No one can tell where their wishes and hopes will lead
Somehow I feel there is happiness waiting for me
Walks in your life you just better be sure it's right
Eyes on the door never let it get out of sight
Just be prepared when the time has come you run away
Sail when the wind starts to blow
But like a fool I don't know
And make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
If you should find you miss
Love we used to share
Love we used to share
Just go back to the places
Oh how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me
When there is always something there to remind me
Don't tell me what it's all about
Out of those chains those chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you
You only get lies and pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again
If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry each time we meet
That you don't see the tears
I just can't get over losing you
So if I should seem broken and blue
That's all that I have left
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye
I've been away so long
I may go wrong and lose my way
I'm going back to find
Some peace of mind in San Jose
Put a hundred down and buy a car
Weeks turn into years
And all the stars there never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas
I've got lots of friends in San Jose
Can't wait to get back to San Jose
Sometimes not often enough
We reflect upon the good things
And I think about those people
Who mean so much to me
And for so many years have made me
And I count the times I have forgotten
I've been so many places in my life and time
I've acted out my love on stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you
I know your image of me is what I hope to be
There's no one more important to me
You taught me precious secrets
Of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you
You taught me precious secrets
Of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you
Such a feeling's coming over me
There is wonder in most everything I see
Not a cloud in the sky
Got the sun in my eyes
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream
Everything I want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear
It's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen
I'm on the top of the world
Looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found
Ever since you've been around
Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's telling me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees
And the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me
There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be
Just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here
I'm on the top of the world
Looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found
Ever since you've been around
I'm on the top of the world
Looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found
Ever since you've been around
Ever had a love as sweet as my love
For nowhere in the world
All my love I give gladly to you
All your love you give gladly to me
We go on hurting each other
We go on hurting each other
Making each other cry
Without ever knowing why
Closer than the leaves
Than the simple letters A and B are
All my life I could love only you
All your life you could love only me
We go on hurting each other
We go on hurting each other
Making each other cry
Without ever knowing why
Got to stop hurting each other
Making each other cry
Breaking each other's heart
Tearing each other apart
Got to stop hurting each other
Making each other cry
Breaking each other's heart
Tearing each other apart
It's going to take some time this time
To get myself in shape
I really fell out of line this time
I really missed the gate
And I won't be so blind next time
And I'll find some harmony
But it's going to take some time this time
And I can't make demands
But like the young trees in the wintertime
I'll learn how to bend
After all the tears we've spent
So it's one more round for experience
And I'm on the road again
And it's going to take some time this time
It's going to take some time this time
No matter what I've planned
But like the young trees in the wintertime
I'll learn how to bend
After all the tears we've spent
So it's one more round for experience
And I'm on the road again
I'll say goodbye to love
No one ever cared if I should live or die
Time and time again the chance for love has passed me by
And all I know of love is how to live without it
I just can't seem to find it
So I've made my mind up I must live my life alone
I'd say goodbye to love
There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine
Surely time will lose its bitter memories
And I'll find that there is someone to believe in and to live for
Something I could live for
All the years of useless search have finally reached an end
Loneliness and empty days will be my only friend
What lies in the future is a mystery to us all
No one can predict the wheel of fortune as it falls
There may come a time when I will see that I've been wrong
But for now this is my song
And it's goodbye to love
I'll say goodbye to love
Bless the beasts and the children
For in this world they have no voice
Bless the beasts and the children
For the world can never be
When the darkness surrounds them
Let it shine all around them
Bless the beasts and the children
Give them shelter from the storm
When the darkness surrounds them
Let it shine all around them
Bless the beasts and the children
Give them shelter from the storm
Everybody always asks me
How I got to play so fine
It really did take some time
And a case of real bad knees
While the other guys were out playing with the football
I was home banging on the keys
I hope you like what I do
And I'll try and sing right too
I guess I'm really very lucky
That I've got this thing to play
And awful allergies that made me sneeze
And now the other guys are out playing with their girlfriends
And I was still banging on the keys
I hope you like what I do
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to who will always care
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you and you'll always smile
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
Touch me and I end up singing
Trouble seems to up and disappear
You touch me with the love you're bringing
I can't really lose when you're near
One look at you and I know that I could learn to live without the rest
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
Listen to the song he sings
As her heavy eyelids fall
He's taking her to where the dolls rule the world
And in that land of make believe
Is where he'll leave her sleeping
Softly warm in a crystal lullaby
He's weaving her a paper castle
Where dancing clowns with tassels made of fur
Welcome her into their world
That lives inside the dreams of every little girl
She's guarded by a brave tin soldier
Sitting on her shoulder
Taken there in a crystal lullaby
Sometimes when I listen to
The velvet song that fills a summer afternoon
Something deep within me sighs
And wishes for the peaceful skies of long ago
That wrapped my cares in silver air
And carried them away
Leaving me and a crystal lullaby
That wrapped my cares in silver air
And carried them away
I've been on this lonely road so long
I remember the last time the signs pointed home
Rented cars and empty motel rooms
Lead you everywhere but home
Crowds of people shouting how they love the show
The endless crowds of faces
Just keep on wearing a smile
The countless times and places
I wonder if these feelings ever change
How many times I'll lift this load
Come tomorrow I'll be gone again
Roads of sorrows coming to an end for me
The endless crowds of faces
Just keep on wearing a smile
The countless times and places
I wonder if these feelings ever change
How many times I'll lift this load
Come tomorrow I'll be gone again
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you
Now when it rains I don't feel cold
Now that I have your hand to hold
The winds might blow through me but I don't care
There's no harm in thunder if you are there
Now when we touch my feelings fly
Now when I'm smiling I know why
You light up my world like the morning sun
Your so deep within me we're almost one
All the fears that I have start to fade
I was always afraid love might forget me
That love might let me down
Then look who I found
The winds might blow through me but I don't care
There's no harm in thunder if you are there
Now when I wake there's someone home
I'll never face the nights alone
You gave me the courage I need to win
To open my heart and to let you in
And I really never knew how
Sing of good things not bad
Sing of happy not sad
Make it simple to last your whole life long
Don't worry that it's not good enough
For anyone else to hear
Let the world sing along
Sing of love there could be
Sing for you and for me
Make it simple to last your whole life long
Don't worry that it's not good enough
For anyone else to hear
Looking for the right words to say
Searching but not finding understanding anyway
We're lost in this masquerade
Both afraid to say we're just too far away
From being close together from the start
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play
Thoughts of leaving disappear each time I see your eyes
And no matter how hard I try
To understand the reason why we carry on this way
We're lost in this masquerade
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play
Thoughts of leaving disappear each time I see your eyes
And no matter how hard I try
To understand the reason why we carry on this way
We're lost in a masquerade
We're lost in a masquerade
A kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
And he'll catch all the fish in the bayou
Here I am just sitting around
With an old piano in a vacant room
And the same old feelings come again
I though I grew but here I am again
I should have seen the train be passing through
And I can't make music
To take me away this time
I know it's an old cliché to say I feel I'm going to die
And I hear it's going out to cry
So I'm going to say some kind words to you
I'd like to wish you luck and hope
That life will be with someone else
Just like I thought it would be with me
And I can't make music
To take me away this time
And I can't make rhyme
When I was young I'd listen to the radio
Waiting for my favorite songs
When they played I'd sing along
Those were such happy times and not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again just like a long lost friend
All the songs I loved so well
When they get to the part where he's breaking her heart
It can really make me cry
It's yesterday once more
Looking back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
It was songs of love that I would sing to them
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away
All my best memories come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry
It's yesterday once more
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now
Seems she forgot all about the library
Like she told her old man now
And with the radio blasting goes cruising
Just as fast as she can now
Was getting wise to you now
And since he took your set of keys you've been
Thinking that your fun is all through now
Got a lot of things to do now
It ended when I lost your love
I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything is the same as it was
How life goes on the way it does
It ended when you said goodbye
I met him on a Monday and my heart stood still
Somebody told me that his name was Bill
And when he walked me home
And when he walked me home
The street was deserted late Friday night
We were bugging each other while we sat out the light
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green
You should have heard the whine from my screaming machine
I flew past La Bream down to Crescent Heights
And all the Jag could see were my six taillights
And then I saw the Jag slide into the curve
I know I'll never forget that horrible sight
You're an angel to me
How I tingle when he passes by
Every time he says hello
My heart begins to fly
He's got something that I can't resist
But he doesn't even know that I exist
I dream of him and me
And how it's going to be
Call me up for a date
But I just sit and wait
I'd rather concentrate
And I pray that some day he'll love me
And together we will see
How lovely heaven will be
And together we will see
They say that you're a run around lover
Though you say it isn't so
But if you put me down for another
And a thousand eyes can't help but see
If you aren't true to me
So remember when you tell those little white lies
That the night has a thousand eyes
One of these days you're going to be sorry
And you'll find out without really trying
Each time that my kisses stray
That the night has a thousand eyes
And a thousand eyes will see me through
And no matter what I do
I could never disguise all those little white lies
So remember when you tell those little white lies
And we'll have everything
Falling in love can bring
That I'm too young to know
If we just wait a while
Think love and wear a smile
Our dreams have magic
Because we'll always stay
And then you'll know our love was meant to be
Those arms I long for will open wide
And you'll be proud to have me right by your side
Morning opens quietly
A shadow vision over me
Hidden by the windowpane
And all my sadness gone charade
Patterns of another day
Rolling down the alleyway
It's calling all my dreams away
After long enough of being alone
Everyone must face their share of loneliness
In my own time nobody knew
The pain I was going through
And waiting was all my heart could do
Hope was all I had until you came
Maybe you can't see how much you mean to me
You were the dawn breaking the night
The promise of morning light
Filing the world surrounding me
Things will be all right
Free as a song singing forever
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave
The past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
I have found my home here in your arms
Nowhere else on earth I'd really rather be
The best is about to be
And so much is left for us to see
Things will be all right
Free as a song singing forever
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave
The past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave
The past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave
You've been out riding fences
But I know that you've got your reasons
These things that are pleasing
You can hurt you somehow
You know the Queen of Hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
But you only want the one that you can't get
Your pain and your hunger
They're driving you home
That's just some people talking
You're a prisoner walking
Through this world all alone
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losing all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes
Come down from your fences
But there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you
There must be some word today
For just a card or just a letter
So many days you passed me by
You didn't stop to make me feel better
As we eye the blue horizon's bend
Earth and sky appear to meet and end
But it's merely an illusion
Like your heart and mine there is no sweet conclusion
No matter how near you'll be
You'll never belong to me
That I'm locked in the bend
For dreams are just like wine
And I am drunk with mine
My heart is a sad affair
There's so much disillusion there
Although we are oceans apart
I can't make you open your heart
That I'm locked in the bend
For dreams are just like wine
And I am drunk with mine
My heart is a sad affair
There's so much disillusion there
Although we are oceans apart
I can't make you open your heart
Who lost his love through his indifference
Until it died within his silence
And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again
And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire
A little hope goes up in smoke
Who would command the hand he's playing
And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again
And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire
And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him takes him down
While life goes on around him everywhere
I've played the game of love before
Too young to know how hard the fall could be
I never thought I'd try again
Somehow you brought the gambler out in me
You can deal me in this time around
Even though the odds are high we'll play them down
You may be a chance I need to take
And the hand I'm holding says it's no mistake
Happy is the way I'm feeling
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changing
Falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
If this is luck then let it ride
If it's the stars they're surely on my side
I've never been so satisfied
By love before for all the times I've tried
These beginnings could mean more
Than the brief affair I bargained for
Little did I know when we began
That my time had come to win a hand
Happy is the way I'm feeling
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changing
Falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
Please forgive me if I seem
To be walking through a waking dream
Laughter never came so easily
There's a freedom here that's new to me
Happy is the way I'm feeling
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changing
Falling in love with you
I have something to tell you
And I know it won't be easy
I've been thinking these past few days
It might be time to leave
You're like a stranger
Always hard to believe
I'm caught between goodbye and I love you
Never knowing quite where I stand
I'm caught between goodbye and I love you
So constantly stranded
I can't understand it
This double life you've handed me
Is like the devil and the deep blue sea
If we go on much longer
If my doubts grow any stronger
Then I may have to let you go
Just to keep love alive
I'm caught between goodbye and I love you
Never knowing quite where I stand
I'm caught between goodbye and I love you
So constantly stranded
I can't understand it
This double life you've handed me
On the first night that we met
Together we've been happy
I have very few regrets
The ordinary problems
Have not been hard to face
But lately little changes
Have been slowly taking place
You're always finding something
Is wrong in what I do
But you can't rearrange my life
Because it pleases you
You've got to love me for what I am
Don't love me for what you intend
Or hope that I will be
And if you're only using me
You're really not in love
I won't pretend to keep you
What I am I have to be
The picture of perfection
For all your expectations
Love can never be designed
We either take each other
For everything we are
Or leave the life we've made behind
And make another start
You've got to love me for what I am
Don't love me for what you intend
Or hope that I will be
And if you're only using me
You're really not in love
And if you're only using me
You're really not in love
You're really not in love
Lying under barren skies
The light escaping from my eyes
Walking down the avenue
I'm followed by the afterglow
Weary to be home again
Among the faces of my friends
Candles burning by the sea
Are waiting for me patiently
There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
You can hear the sound of lovers in love
And nobody else in sight
There's nobody else and I'm feeling good
Just holding you tight
So listen very carefully
Get closer now and you will see
The only sound that you will hear
Is when I whisper in your ear
There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
People just like us are falling in love
So listen very carefully
Get closer now and you will see
The only sound that you will hear
Is when I whisper in your ear
There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
You are the one who makes me happy
Yours is the voice that wakes me mornings
And sends me out into the day
You are the crowd that sits quiet listening to me
And all the mad sense I make
You are one of the few things
And since it's all true
Sorry if sometimes I look past you
There's no one beyond your eyes
Inside my head the wheels are turning
And sometimes I'm not so wise
Just like the old love song goes
You are one of the few things
And since it's all true
Just like the old love song goes
You are one of the few things
And since it's all true
Looking at you I'm almost home again
Something in you puts me at ease
You know I've been in love before
But though I've been in love before
You know how rainy weather
Gets me down when I'm alone
You got to be a friend today
Would chase the winter away
Being with you I'm like a child again
Your eyes can see clearer than mine
No one ever made me quite so aware
No one ever took the time
The time it took surprises me
As if my life began again
You know how rainy weather
Gets me down when I'm alone
You got to be a friend today
Would chase the winter away
I was born on a farm out in Iowa
A flaming youth I was bound I would fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play
Corn fed chords appeal to me
I like rustic harmony
Hold a note and change the key
Not according to the rules
That you learn in music schools
But the folks just dance like fools
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestra
Got together a new kind of orchestra
You know I can't smile without you
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't walk
I'm finding it hard even to talk
And I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
And you must know what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you
You came along just like a song
You brightened my day
Who'd believe you were part of a dream
That only seemed light years away
And you know I can't smile without you
I can't smile without you
And you must know what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you
Some people say the happiness way
Is something that's hard to find
Into the new leaving the old behind me
And I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
And you must know what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you
Into the new leaving the old behind me
And I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
And you must know what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you
And you must know what I'm going through
The hardest thing I've ever done is keep believing
There's someone in this crazy world for me
The way that people come and go through temporary lives
My chance could come and I might never know
It took a while for me to learn that nothing comes for free
The price I've paid is high enough for me
I know I need to be in love
I know I've wasted too much time
I know why I asked perfection of a quite imperfect world
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find
So here I am with pockets full of good intentions
But none of them will comfort me tonight
I know I need to be in love
I know I've wasted too much time
I know why I asked perfection of a quite imperfect world
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find
I know I need to be in love
I know I've wasted too much time
I know why I asked perfection of a quite imperfect world
I'm going way down south
And though I'm really far away
And no one need really know
One more time for the good times
That far outweigh the bad
One more time for the good times
When love was all we had
I'm going way down south
To Baton Rouge tonight
And turn out all the lights
And all the images dance by
Of folks and friends who lie
Back home where things are slow
One more time for the good times
That far outweigh the bad
One more time for the good times
When love was all we had
I'm a California label from the top of my head
See a lot of open sky when the sun goes down
There's a hot lot of loving when you come around
All those letters mailed
We are riding in a boat to sail
Brian Wilson songs are never left behind
All those letters mailed
We are riding in a boat to sail
I have always been a dreamer
Followed visions of my own
To the lines of a song
And make then my home
I believe in happy endings
Though I've only known a few
For as rare as they are
Like a bright falling star
All the world can seem so friendless
And the road ahead so endless
And the dream so far away
When I'm almost to surrender
Then I stop and I remember
I have you to save my day
Has me reaching out too far
When I fell you were there
With you hand in the air
You knew from the start
After all you've done to save me
Through the love you freely gave me
Every step along the way
People ask what keeps me going
And in truth it comes from knowing
I have you to save my day
Feeling helpless when I held you
Wishing words would come to tell you
Breaking up is hard to do
Don't take your love away from me
Don't you leave my heart in misery
If you go then I'll be blue
Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
Think of all that we been through
Breaking up is hard to do
They say that breaking up is hard to do
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up I wish that we were making up again
Can't we give our love another try
Can't we give our love another try
Don't you ever invite your boyfriend here
I like to be here alone
You just answer the door and feed the deer
And fight the telephone
Got to learn these words and I know you will
Or I'll send you right back to Guayaquil
You got to froth and foam
Got to send away the mad puppeteer
Who seems to think this is home
I want you to speak the English right
I want you to smile and be polite
Don't let them steal my chrome
Long as you leave me alone
I just want you to try and remember one thing
If somebody knocks or the telephone rings
Like sailing on a sailing ship to nowhere
Love took over my heart like an ocean breeze
As seagulls fly I knew that I was losing
Love was washed away with the drifting tide
Oh it's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song
It's got you laying up nights
Waiting for the music to start
It's such a dirty old shame
When you've got to take the blame for a love song
Because the best love songs
Are written with a broken heart
Now the tears in my eyes are ever blinding
The future that lies before me I cannot see
Although tomorrow I know the sun is rising
Lighting up the world for everyone but not for me
Oh it's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song
It's got you laying up nights
Waiting for the music to start
It's such a dirty old shame
When you've got to take the blame for a love song
Because the best love songs
Are written with a broken heart
Oh it's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song
It's got you laying up nights
Waiting for the music to start
It's such a dirty old shame
When you've got to take the blame for a love song
Because the best love songs
Are written with a broken heart
Oh it's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song
It's got you laying up nights
Waiting for the music to start
It's such a dirty old shame
When you've got to take the blame for a love song
Because the best love songs
And though I'm wide awake I know my dream is coming true
And oh I just fall in love again
Just one touch and then it happens every time
The way I hold you and the night just seems to fly
Easy for you to take me to a star
Heaven is that moment when I look into your eyes
And oh I just fall in love again
Just one touch and then it happens every time
And oh I just fall in love again
Just one touch and then it happens every time
Fighting against our common enemies
Foreign domination of our industries
Reaching for our common goals
Let the world know that our great nation is awakening
Beats in the humble bodies
As a mere observer of this tasteless phenomenon
One has to admire the stage management
There again perhaps I'm more than a mere observer
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
Don't keep your distance
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
Don't keep your distance
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do
You're always in my heart
From early in the morning till it's dark
When I wake up in the morning and I see you there
I always whisper a little prayer
I got to know that you love me
And that you'll always be there
I got to know that you care
And I got to feel your arms around me
And you'll always be there
I got to know that you care
If my times are bringing me down
You're the only one that I want around
And if I'm all strung out
You're the only one who can straighten me out
I got to know that you love me
And that you'll always be there
I got to know that you care
And I got to feel your arms around me
And you'll always be there
I got to know that you care
I got to know that you love me
And that you'll always be there
I got to know that you care
And I got to feel your arms around me
And you'll always be there
I got to know that you care
You're always in my heart
From early in the morning till it's dark
It's never really lived but it's never really died
It's never really made it but it's tried
God knows I've tried so many times
It's never really lived but it's never really died
It's never really made it but it's tried
The other side of me just caught a flight
Let us put man and woman together
And see which one is smarter
Some say man but I say no
The woman got the man like a puppet show
The men are leading the women astray
But I say that the women today
Are smarter than men in every way
Little boy sat down and cried
An old man passing asked him why
He said I can't do what the big boys do
Old man sat down and he cried too
The men are leading the women astray
But I say that the women today
Are smarter than men in every way
Please close your eyes and concentrate
With every thought you think
Upon the recitation we're about to sing
Calling occupants of interplanetary craft
Calling occupants of interplanetary craft
Calling occupants of interplanetary craft
You've been observing our Earth
And we'd like to make
Calling occupants of interplanetary craft
We've been observing your Earth
And one night we'll make
Only our love we will teach them
Our Earth may never survive
Oh won't you give us a sign
That we've reached you
With your mind you have ability to form
And transmit thought energy far beyond the norm
To send the message we declare World Contact Day
Calling occupants of interplanetary craft
Calling occupants of interplanetary craft
Shall ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the son of God appears
Christmas future is far away
Christmas past is past
Christmas present is here today
Bringing joy that will last
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
From now on our troubles
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
Hang your shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
Hang your shining star upon the highest bough
Candles gleaming inside
Painted candy canes on the tree
He's filled his sleigh with things
Things for you and for me
It's that time of year
When the world falls in love
Every song you hear seems to say
And this song of mine
It's that time of year
When the world falls in love
Every song you hear seems to say
And this song of mine
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
For a sleigh ride together with you
Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
For a sleigh ride together with you
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Just holding your hand
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
We're snuggled up together
Like birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
For a sleigh ride together with you
There's a Christmas party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
As they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
For a sleigh ride together with you
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
For a sleigh ride together with you
It's Christmas time and time for a carol
Time to sing about the little King
To fill the bowl and roll out the barrel
Have ourselves a fling
We greet a friend or welcome a stranger
And celebrate the child in the manger
Born on Christmas day
Good cheer for you and for me
With pleasure and glee to share
Oh we're so happy to be together
And it falls like snow
Take a look about and say
Merry Christmas to one and all
It's Christmas time and time for a carol
Time to sing about the little King
To fill the bowl and roll out the barrel
Have ourselves a fling
We greet a friend or welcome a stranger
And celebrate the child in the manger
Born on Christmas day
Good cheer for you and for me
With pleasure and glee to share
Oh we're so happy to be
Together on yuletide square
And it falls like snow
Take a look about and say
Soon the snowflakes will fall
And tomorrow you'll see
Waiting under the tree
Pleasant dreams through the night
Soon you'll hear the bells ring
Time for dreams to come true
As the world wakes you dream
Christmas future is far away
Christmas past is past
Christmas present is here today
Bringing joy that will last
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
From now on our troubles
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
Hang your shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
Hang your shining star upon the highest bough
So you better watch out
Santa Claus is coming to town
And checking it twice
Who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
And checking it twice
Who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Santa Claus is coming to town
All through the year we've waited
Waited through spring and fall
To hear silver bells ringing
See wintertime bringing
The happiest season of all
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Will help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Merry Christmas to you
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Shepherd quake at the sight
Glorious dream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Bells in bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Oh what fun it is to ride
Oh the first snowfall of the winter
Was a day that we all waited for
When it drifted to and fro
It was near seven feet or more
Oh the first snowfall of the winter
What a joy for a boy to behold
In each house you'll find a sleigh
That was waiting for this day
And of course down the road a hill
For each Jack and Jill
Every winter breeze that scurries
Sets the snowflakes up in flurries
It's the good old sentimental season when
Folks put runners on their surreys
And forget about their worries
When a man becomes a boy once again
Oh the first snowfall of the winter
Jingle bells bring us spells ever dear
It was snowing all the day
And it showed no signs of stopping
Every kid with eyes of popping
Will soon be belly whopping on his ear
On the first snowfall of the winter
Oh that first snowfall of the year
The first snow of the year
Is just about the best snow
Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
It doesn't show a single sign of stopping
And I've got some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
We finally kiss goodnight
How I hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
But as long as you love me so
Greeting cards have all been sent
The Christmas rush is through
But I still have one wish to make
A special one for you
But I can dream and in my dreams
There's always something new
But every day is a holiday
The lights on my tree
To see you and to say
That I wish you merry Christmas
I've just one wish on this Christmas Eve
I wish I were with you
To see you and to say
That I wish you merry Christmas
I've just one wish on this Christmas Eve
I wish I were with you
I wish I were with you
I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back
I'll be home for Christmas
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
I'll be home for Christmas
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
Hear him crying in the manger
Only swaddle for his garment
With his holy mother Mary
And on earth peace to all men
Hear the joyful angels singing
In the lane snow is glistening
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is a new bird
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
But you can do the job while you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
The plans that we've made
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear
It's Christmas time in the city
The orange and palm trees sway
There's never been such a day
But it's December the twenty fourth
And I'm longing to be up north
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a White Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
As a child I was known for make believing
All alone I created fantasies
But my heart helped me hold the memories
As I walk through the world I find around me
Like a child's eyes on a Christmas night
It's a new day for those good old dreams
One by one it seems they're coming true
Here's the morning that my heart had seen
Here's the morning that just had to come through
Same old stage but what a change of scene
No more dark horizons only blue
It's a new day for those good old dreams
All my life I've dreamed of loving you
You're a spark of a long forgotten fire
You're a touch of a slowly growing wind
You're a taste of the ever changing seasons
Telling me there are some things that don't end
We have left all the darkness far behind us
You hear it once again and it carries you away
It's a new day for those good old dreams
One by one it seems they're coming true
Here's the morning that my heart had seen
Here's the morning that just had to come through
Same old stage but what a change of scene
No more dark horizons only blue
It's a new day for those good old dreams
All my life I've dreamed of you
It's a new day for those good old dreams
You've been so quiet lately
Sometimes I wonder has the cat got your tongue
You seem to be a thousand miles away
That it's going to be that time again
When you have the need for someone else
I know you better than you know yourself
Sometimes it takes the strength of a woman
To understand the weakness of her man
It's going to take the strength of this woman
To keep fighting for the loving of her man
And it isn't new to you no more
Waiting for you to find your way back home
Sometimes it takes the strength of a woman
To understand the weakness of her man
It's going to take the strength of this woman
To keep fighting for the loving of her man
I know how hard you tried to hide this all from me
But if you keep a silent heart I can't give you what you need
So hold me close and hold me tight
Let's say goodnight and never say goodbye
Sometimes it takes the strength of a woman
To understand the weakness of her man
It's going to take the strength of this woman
To keep fighting for the loving of her man
Sometimes it takes the strength of a woman
To understand the weakness of her man
It's going to take the strength of this woman
You know it doesn't seem that long ago
That I had your love and let it go
And I really let you down I know
I guess it took a while for me to see
What it is you really mean to me
I've been as big a fool as I can be
I want you back in my life again
I don't want to be your remember when
I want you back in my life again
Let's go back to the place where it all began
I've lived long enough with your memory
Now I know that I need you here with me
There was a time I thought I had it made
But I didn't see the price I had paid
That the price gets higher every day
You're the only one who knows my heart
So let's take it right back to the start
And I won't have to play the part
I want you back in my life again
I don't want to be your remember when
I want you back in my life again
Let's go back to the place where it all began
I've lived long enough with your memory
I want you back in my life again
You're the only one who knows my heart
So let's take it right back to the start
And I won't have to play the part
I want you back in my life again
I don't want to be your remember when
I want you back in my life again
Let's go back to the place where it all began
I've lived long enough with your memory
Now I know that I want you
I know that I need you back in my life
I want you back in my life
When you've got what it takes you've got nothing to hide
You've got miles of feelings and acres of pride
When you know who you are then you live what you feel
You give what you can and it's good when you've really
Got it and when you've got it
Let them know inside you've got it
Let it shine like a fine tomorrow
What a difference it makes
When you've got what it takes
What a difference it makes
When you're sure of your heart then you give it away
And love is a promise you keep every day
You know it and when you know it
You begin to believe you'll do more than survive
That the best part of being is being alive
You feel it and when you feel it
Let them know inside you've got it
Let it shine like a fine tomorrow
When a difference it makes
When you've got what it takes
What a difference it makes
When a difference it makes
When you've got what it takes
What a difference it makes
When a difference it makes
When you've got what it takes
What a difference it makes
Somebody's been lying
Somebody's been calling me
Telling me he still loves me
But not the way I thought it would be
He's making fun of me
And laughing at my dreams
And I know that he keeps
He's telling me to just hold on
But he's not here to lean on
It isn't easy letting go of what we had
And I guess I'm just scared
And I still believe him though
I'd be wiser to go on my own way
Somebody's been lying
And I know you're telling me
Only the things you want to
I guess I lie as much as you do
It seems so funny letting go of yesterday
Guess we're much too afraid
And we're much too alone
When you say that you will reach into the sky
And steal a star so you can put it on my finger
When you say that every time that we make love
Will be the first time we've made love and every act of love
Blind faith makes me follow you
I'd live in a cave if you wanted to
Just ask me and I'll marry you
You don't have to sell me
When you swear your love will keep on growing strong
And that forever isn't long enough to love me
Blind faith makes me follow you
I'd live in a cave if you wanted to
Just ask me and I'll marry you
You don't have to sell me
When you say you'll fill my body with your soul
And love will grow into a freckled little girl
We want to hold each other
Just let our hearts beat together
When we're close like this
And let me steal a kiss
Come on and touch me when we're dancing
You know you've got that loving touch
Oh touch me when we're dancing
I want to feel you when I'm falling in love
And it feels so right
My heart is saying it to me
I've waited for so long
So let your love flow through me
Just to be this close
You've got me up so high
I could fly coast to coast
Come on and touch me when we're dancing
You know you've got that loving touch
Oh touch me when we're dancing
I want to feel you when I'm falling in love
Touch me when we're dancing
You know you've got that loving touch
Oh touch me when we're dancing
I want to feel you when I'm falling in love
Touch me when we're dancing
You know you've got that loving touch
Oh touch me when we're dancing
Where's the word for the sadness
Where's the poetry in the pain
Where the tears have fallen
Where's the method to this madness
As we create this suffering
And we do each other in
And he can't go on a living a memory
Mulling it over endlessly
And he can't go on trying to live a lie
I know it's over but I may never know why
There's no face in the locket
There's no place for the past
I'll put it back in my pocket
It was never meant to last
And he can't go on a living a memory
Mulling it over endlessly
And he can't go on trying to live a lie
I know it's over but I may never know why
There's no word for the sadness
There's no poetry in the pain
Where the tears have fallen
You can have this dance with me
And whisper in my ear
Sweet words that I love to hear
I'd like to get to know you
I'd like to make you mine
Sitting here so patiently
And have this dance with me
You can call me up and have a date any old time
I'd like to get to know you
I'd like to make you mine
You can call me up and have a date any old time
I'd like to get to know you
I'd like to make you mine
You can call me up and have a date any old time
It was more fun to be children
We just took life as it happened
Wink of an eye and it's over
What a surprise to discover
We were people ourselves
No answer ever came to me
I didn't sleep at all last night
But what my heart says I will give you
Because you are in love
Your eyes begin to open
As if you had awoken from a sleep
Because you are in love
And lose your concentration
When someone drops his name
You're back in his arms as always
Your daydreams work out that way
It's all just a trick your mind plays
That you loves him so
Because we are in love
We reach for our tomorrows
And know we won't be lonely
In laughter and in sorrows
There is the place we'll keep our hope forever
There is the place we'll keep our hope forever
Now when it rains I don't feel cold
Now that I have your hand to hold
The winds might blow through me but I don't care
There's no harm in thunder if you are there
Now when we touch my feelings fly
Now when I'm smiling I know why
You light up my world like the morning sun
Your so deep within me we're almost one
All the fears that I have start to fade
I was always afraid love might forget me
That love might let me down
Then look who I found
The winds might blow through me but I don't care
There's no harm in thunder if you are there
Now when I wake there's someone home
I'll never face the nights alone
You gave me the courage I need to win
To open my heart and to let you in
And I really never knew how
Here I am feeling confined
Neon lights are making me blind
I need time out in the sunshine
Maybe I should get away
Take myself a holiday
No more calls begging my time
No more walls for me to climb
I can't wait to feel the sunshine
Someone's got to take my place
Running in the human race
Sailing on the tide in the morning
How I love that salty air
Sailing to the wide horizon
Let the fresh winds guide us there
Maybe if you feel like it too
You might like to make the run
To my beautiful island in the sun
Over there people are slow
Low key life is all that they know
Lying around high on the sunshine
Sleepy beaches everywhere
Anyone is welcome there
Could be days or maybe a year
I'm going to be free in the sunshine
Sailing on the tide in the morning
How I love that salty air
Sailing to the wide horizon
Let the fresh winds guide us there
Maybe if you feel like it too
You might like to make the run
To my beautiful island in the sun
Sailing to the wide horizon
Let the fresh winds guide us there
Maybe if you feel like it too
You might like to make the run
If I never had another
Never hold another lover
All the rest are second best compared to you
If I never know another
After what we've known together
I've already had my sweetest dreams come true
In these eyes that adore you
Believing that she might be seeing love
Won't you listen to this heart
If they'll only shine their lucky starlight down on me
Make it bright enough for only you to see
Believing that she might be seeing love
Won't you listen to this heart
If they'll only shine their lucky starlight down on me
Make it bright enough for only you to see
We tried our hand at love before
We've been around the game enough to know the score
But then is then and now is now
And now is all that matters anyhow
Make believe it's your first time
Leave your sadness behind
Make believe it's your first time
And I'll make believe it's mine
Make believe it's your first time
Leave your sadness behind
Make believe it's your first time
And I'll make believe it's mine
So close your eyes and hug me close
Let our hearts pretend
That love is ours to share tonight
And it might never end
Make believe it's your first time
Leave your sadness behind
Make believe it's your first time
And I'll make believe it's mine
Make believe it's your first time
Lately I can hardly see the sun
But nothing in your eyes seems to hold me
Truth or consequences
Someone said that time would ease the pain
Of two lives love has torn apart
But I believe whoever wrote that song
Never had a broken heart
And no one likes to be the first to know
Someone has to answer
And keeping on like this is torture
You know is twice as bad for sure
Someone said that time would ease the pain
Of two lives love has torn apart
But I believe whoever wrote that song
Never had a broken heart
And I love you more than ever
Someone said that time would ease the pain
Of two lives love has torn apart
But I believe whoever wrote that song
Never had a broken heart
Someone said that time would ease the pain
Of two lives love has torn apart
But I believe whoever wrote that song
At the end of a song there's no one
After the last note is played
Only the memory stays
Then even that fades away
And there is nothing so hard
As convincing your heart
That you should start singing again
At the end of a song there's no one
After the last note is played
Only the memory stays
Then even that fades away
And there's is nothing so hard
As convincing your heart
That you should start singing again
I always think with my heart
Seems I was born for the part
It's a lesson to be learned
And a page I should have turned
I shouldn't cry but I do
Like an ordinary fool
When his ordinary dreams fall through
How many times have I mistaken
And how many times have I mistaken
When a road I've walked before
Ends alone at my front door
I shouldn't cry but I do
Like an ordinary fool
When his ordinary dreams fall through
When a road I've walked before
Ends alone at my front door
I shouldn't cry but I do
Like an ordinary fool
Playing it safe so long
You lost your inspiration
Clinging to things that turn out wrong
Won't help a situation
Making me pay for the unhappy times
Maybe the moon night make you change your mind
Give yourself a bit of some prime time love
You're looking in the face of prime time love
I know she left you cold
That's why you need protection
Buying the lies that you were sold
Keeps you from true affection
Why waste your nights on trying to find
Give yourself a bit of some prime time love
You're looking in the face of prime time love
Give yourself a bit of some prime time love
You're looking in the face of prime time love
This one's from the heart
Give yourself a bit of some prime time love
You're looking in the face of prime time love
Give yourself a bit of some prime time love
Just take some loneliness
And add a tear or two
Throw in some emptiness
Mix till you're bluer than blue
Keep it all under cover
Next to your broken dreams when you're through
Then you'll know how I
Makes you want to die
Your baby doesn't love you any more
You try to make believe
It doesn't bother you
For your own sake believe
You'll make it through
Just make a vow every morning
That today you will change your point of view
That you play in vain
When your baby doesn't love you any more
Your baby doesn't love you any more
And there's nothing that you can do
When your baby doesn't love you any more
Your baby doesn't love you any more
Your baby doesn't love you any more
Would be quite semantically true
But make believe passion
Has fallen from fashion's milieu
Why we're a little confused
It's asking for trouble
Just watching the six o'clock news
There's a need for them now
When the world has us down
Fantasy's reality's childhood
We can still make the stars
We can still break the bars
We have built here on earth
Better for you and me
Blame blind yesterday
For taking dreams away
Fantasy's reality's childhood
We can still make the stars
We can still break the bars
We have built here on earth
Better for you and me
Blame blind yesterday
For taking dreams away
It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold
To touch their harps of gold
While the merry bells keep ringing
May your every wish come true
May the calendar keep bringing
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
We will lend a coat of fur
See the fur to keep you warm
O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains
Carols being sung by the tree
Window's candlelight shining bright
For the whole world to see
Children's eyes of sweet expectations
Wondering what each present will hold
Lying in their beds and impatient
On long Christmas Eves of old
It used to be that all the family
Would gather for this one night
It used to be that special feeling
Shared together knowing
Memories that last through the years
For no matter how far away you roam
When you long for the sunshine of a friendly gaze
I met a man who lives in Tennessee and he was heading for
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie
If you want to be happy in a million ways
I met a man who lives in Tennessee and he was heading for
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie
If you want to be happy in a million ways
Lift up your voice and send a prayer above
Help me rejoice and fill that prayer with love
Now I know my life has been all wrong
Lift up your voice and help a sinner be strong
Said the night wind to the little lamb
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Said the king to the people everywhere
He will bring us goodness and light
As I praise thy birth bend down thy ear
Over a stable a star shone so bright
Guiding three wise men who rode through the night
So you better watch out
Santa Claus is coming to town
And checking it twice
Who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
And checking it twice
Who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Santa Claus is coming to town
Maybe it's much too early in the game
Ah but I thought I'd ask you just the same
What are you doing New Year's
Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight
When it's exactly twelve o'clock that night
Welcoming in the New Year
Maybe I'm crazy to suppose
I'd ever be the one you chose
Out of a thousand invitations
Ah but in case I stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
What are you doing New Year's
Maybe I'm crazy to suppose
I'd ever be the one you chose
Out of a thousand invitations
Ah but in case I stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
What are you doing New Year's
I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
And in despair I bowed my head
For hate s strong and mocks the song
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doth he sleep
You know I can't explain what's going down
My head keeps spinning round
And that's all right with me
The way that love should be
That helps me through the day
I'll always feel this way
Into that wonderland where only lovers go
I got that strange sensation deep inside
That only you can satisfy
And that's all right with me
The way that love should be
That helps me through the day
I'll always feel this way
So give me loving like I've never know before
And that's all right with me
The way that love should be
That helps me through the day
I'll always feel this way
And that's all right with me
The way that love should be
That helps me through the day
Lying on a bed of leaves
Watching clouds up through the trees
You said our love was more than time
The trees are bare and nights are long
I can't get warm since you've been gone
I can't stop singing sad songs
You said you'd take me through the years
Like falling leaves on windy days
Flutter past then they fly away
I though I knew you oh so well
I need to feel you in the night
I need to your smile so warm and bright
I wish my mind could let you go
You said you'd take me through the years
You said you'd take me through the years
You said you'd take me through the years
I can see the outline of her shadow traced in the air
Sometimes I see her bended over your shoulder
I think what lies has she told you
And I see a smile light up your face
You like what she says
But I play dumb instead
She's the uninvited guest
Who lives in our house
She's the other woman
And I'm running second best
To the uninvited guest
And it's breaking my heart
You don't know how I know
If it all was in the open you'd deny that it it's so
It's not happening to others
It's happening to you and me
And the pain is intense
I should leave you but I love you
Though it doesn't make sense
She's the uninvited guest
Who lives in our house
She's the other woman
And I'm running second best
To the uninvited guest
And it's breaking my heart
I should leave you but I love you
Though it doesn't make sense
She's the uninvited guest
Who lives in our house
She's the other woman
And I'm running second best
To the uninvited guest
And it's breaking my heart
Drifting through the dreams we used to share
Thinking about the times we spent in love without a care
And wishing you were there
And you need someone next to you to hold you tight
Just call me and I'll be there by your side
Seemed like what we had was growing strong
Never even crossed our minds that love would soon be gone
I guess that we were wrong
And you need someone next to you to hold you tight
Just call me and I'll be there by your side
And you need someone next to you to hold you tight
Just call me and I'll be there by your side
Maybe I'm just living in the past
But when I meet the right one I know that I'll be true
My first love will be my last
When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I fall in love with you
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Serenade me by the light of the moon
Let's sing and dance as lovers do
When the morning light shines down on me
As the stars go sailing by
We can count them you and I
We can make a wish when one falls from the sky
And my only wish would be
That forever I would see
You moving through the darkness smiling that way at me
Kiss me the way you did last night
Kiss me the way you did last night
Tonight until the morning light
Celebrate love while the feeling is new
It's a moment that was meant for me and you
If tomorrow never comes I won't care
I'll just love you tonight and all we share
Kiss me the way you did last night
Kiss me the way you did last night
Tonight until the morning light
Kiss me the way you did last night
Kiss me the way you did last night
Kiss me the way you did last night
Tonight until the morning light
Kiss me the way you did last night
Kiss me the way you did last night
I'd love to think what your smile is leading to
I feel your eyes starting a fire all over me
Remember when loving took all night
Remember the feeling of doing it right
You've been gone too long
Now it's going to be all right
We'll take all night again tonight
I think you know that missing you took all my time
Loneliness never ran so deep till then
Now here we are lost in a feeling of feeling good
Remember when loving took all night
Remember the feeling of doing it right
You've been gone too long
Now it's going to be all right
You're the one I always dream of
Every line of your face
Is sketched so plain inside my heart
You've grown so deep inside of me
You're everything I feel and see
You're the one I love
I can feel when you're beside me
Suddenly becomes so clear
My heart has overtaken me
With feelings you awake in me
You're the one I love
Only you could move me enough
To believe in love one more time
All I need to know for tomorrow
If our friends all around
Find it hard to understand us
The other one so very well
And that's what I've been looking for
So I keep coming back for more
You're the one I love
Looking out upon the city lights
And the stars above the ocean
Got my ticket for the midnight plane
And it's not easy to leave again
Took my clothes and put them in the bag
Try not to think just yet of leaving
Looking out into the city night
And it's not easy to leave again
Each time Honolulu city lights
Stir up memories in me
Each night Honolulu city lights
You are my island sunset
You are my island dream
Put on my shoes and light a cigarette
Wondering which of my friends will be here
Standing with their leis around my neck
It's not easy to leave again
Each time Honolulu city lights
Stir up memories in me
Each night Honolulu city lights
Take a little time for some romance
Whispering the words I want to hear
It's been a long night
Now my head is on your shoulder and it's so right
Your sweet and gentle kisses on these closing eyes
Tonight I will be dreaming of you
When I saw you for the first time
I never thought that this could be
I never thought you'd come my way
I never thought I'd hear you say
Now it's a slow dance
When I saw you for the first time
I never thought that this could be
I never thought you'd come my way
I never thought I'd hear you say
Seems that I've been waiting for it so long
Waiting for this moment and someone like you
To make all my dreams come true
I wouldn't have the TV in the bedroom
I wouldn't have this teardrop in my eye
I wouldn't need the radio to be my lullaby
I wouldn't need the sun to light the morning
If I could have your love to light my night
I'd never for a second keep our love from burning bright
If I had you in my life
I wouldn't be the fool I've been
I'd never let the loving end
So say that you believe in second chances
And say you'll let me be with you tonight
If you'll take my hand I'll show you just how love could be so right
I wouldn't be the fool I've been
I'd never let the loving end
If you'll take my hand I'll show you just how love could be so right
I wouldn't be the fool I've been
I'd never let the loving end
Sit there and count your fingers
Sit there and count your little fingers
Unlucky little girl blue
Sit there and count the raindrops
All you can count on is the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue
Your hope is getting slender
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy
When I was very young the world was younger than I
As merry as a carousel
The circus tent was strong with every star in the sky
Above the ring I loved so well
Now the young world has grown old
Gone are the tinsel and gold
Your hope is getting slender
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy
The day would never end
The road would never bend
A man ain't got a friend
Would never see a plow
Would be deserted now
But he's no good no how
I got my trouble and woe
What makes the rain to fall
What makes that grass so tall
There ain't no love at all
I fell in love with you
Before the second show
It sounds so sweet and clear
But you're not really here
And I can hardly wait
And play your sad guitar
Talking to myself and feeling old
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
What I've got they used to call the blues
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
Nice to know somebody loves me
Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do
Run and find the one who loves me
What I feel has come and gone before
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do
Run and find the one who loves me
What I feel has come and gone before
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
You don't know what you're missing
He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Save it all till somebody else lends you a hand
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
I got daisies in green pastures
You won't find him around my door
Calling out around the world
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the streets
They're dancing in Chicago
There'll be music everywhere
And dancing in the streets
Oh it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
Everywhere around the world
They're dancing in the street
They're dancing in the street
They're dancing in the street
I hear singing and there's no one there
I smell blossoms and the trees are bare
All day long I seem to walk on air
I keep tossing in my sleep at night
And what's more I've lost my appetite
Stars that used to twinkle in the skies
It is not so surprising
That you feel very strange but nice
I know just what's the matter
Because I've been there once or twice
Put your head on my shoulder
You need someone who's older
A rubdown with a velvet glove
There is nothing you can take
To relieve that pleasant ache
I hear singing and there's no one there
I smell blossoms and the trees are bare
All day long I seem to walk on air
It is not so surprising
That you feel very strange but nice
I know just what's the matter
Because I've been there once or twice
Stars that used to twinkle in the skies
Stars that used to twinkle in the skies
Looking for the right words to say
Searching but not finding understanding anyway
We're lost in this masquerade
Both afraid to say we're just too far away
From being close together from the start
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play
Thoughts of leaving disappear each time I see your eyes
And no matter how hard I try
To understand the reason why we carry on this way
We're lost in this masquerade
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play
Thoughts of leaving disappear each time I see your eyes
And no matter how hard I try
To understand the reason why we carry on this way
We're lost in a masquerade
We're lost in a masquerade
You're my funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
In every lovely summer's day
In every thing that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
The world will always welcome lovers
Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much any more
I don't get around much
I don't get around much
I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
You know that we were meant to be
More than just friends
I let a song go out of my heart
When the morning sunrise
Before your very eyes
And all the sounds of life
You hear a song of hope
And feel the promise of
A brand new kind of world
Come let me help you see
The way to leave yesterday behind
We should be together
When we're this close
To work it out somehow
We found a dream to share
Just let my song of love
And feel the promise of
A brand new kind of world
The way to leave yesterday behind
The way to leave yesterday behind
When I was young I'd listen to the radio
Waiting for my favorite songs
When they played I'd sing along
Those were such happy times and not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again just like a long lost friend
All the songs I loved so well
When they get to the part where he's breaking her heart
It can really make me cry
It's yesterday once more
Looking back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
It was songs of love that I would sing to them
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away
All my best memories come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry
It's yesterday once more
When two hearts are caring
Memories we've been sharing
I'll never forget the moment we kissed
The night of the hayride
I wish you'd forget that you ever heard
Sing of good things not bad
Sing of happy not sad
Make it simple to last your whole life long
Don't worry that it's not good enough
For anyone else to hear
Let the world sing along
Sing of love there could be
Sing for you and for me
Make it simple to last your whole life long
Don't worry that it's not good enough
For anyone else to hear
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day
Just in case you feel you want to hold her
Why do birds suddenly appear
Just like me they long to be
Why do stars fall down from the sky
Just like me they long to be
On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
And starlight in your eyes of blue
Just like me they long to be
On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
And starlight in your eyes of blue
Just like me they long to be
Tell the sun to leave the sky
Ask a baby not to cry
I would sell my very soul
For to live without your love
We've only just begun to live
White lace and promises
A kiss for luck and we're on our way
Before the rising sun we fly
So many roads to choose
We start out walking and learn to run
Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talking it over just the two of us
And when the evening comes we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talking it over just the two of us
And when the evening comes we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
But I don't let the evening get me down
Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Don't let the moon break your heart
In the daylight it dies
Don't let the stars get in your eyes
For some day I'll return
And you know you're the only one I'll ever love
All the leaves are brown
On such a winter's day
Stopped into a church
I passed along the way
You know the preacher digs the cold
He knows I'm going to stay
On such a winter's day
All the leaves are brown
On such a winter's day
On such a winter's day
Why are there so many songs about rainbows
And rainbows have nothing to hide
Who said that wishes would be heard and answered
Look what it's done so far
What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing
I've heard them calling my name
The voice might be one and the same
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be
Someday we'll find it
The Rainbow Connection
Sing of good things not bad
Sing of happy not sad
Make it simple to last your whole life long
Don't worry that it's not good enough
For anyone else to hear
Let the world sing along
Sing of love there could be
Sing for you and for me
Make it simple to last your whole life long
Don't worry that it's not good enough
For anyone else to hear
Why do birds suddenly appear
Just like me they long to be
Why do stars fall down from the sky
Just like me they long to be
On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
And starlight in your eyes of blue
Just like me they long to be
On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
And starlight in your eyes of blue
Just like me they long to be
Strangers in many ways
We've got a lifetime to share
And as we go from day to day
I'll feel you close to me
But time alone will tell
Let's take a lifetime to say
For only time will tell us so
Strangers in many ways
Let's take a lifetime to say
For only time will tell us so
I think I'm going to be sad
The boy that's driving me mad
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
He said that living with me
He would never be free
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
Don't know why he's riding so high
I think I'm going to be sad
The boy that's driving me mad
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
Think I'm going to be sad
Think I'm going to be sad
Think I'm going to be sad
Think I'm going to be sad
Think I'm going to be sad
After long enough of being alone
Everyone must face their share of loneliness
In my own time nobody knew
The pain I was going through
And waiting was all my heart could do
Hope was all I had until you came
Maybe you can't see how much you mean to me
You were the dawn breaking the night
The promise of morning light
Filing the world surrounding me
Things will be all right
Free as a song singing forever
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave
The past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
I have found my home here in your arms
Nowhere else on earth I'd really rather be
The best is about to be
And so much is left for us to see
Things will be all right
Free as a song singing forever
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave
The past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave
The past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to who will always care
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you and you'll always smile
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
Touch me and I end up singing
Trouble seems to up and disappear
You touch me with the love you're bringing
I can't really lose when you're near
One look at you and I know that I could learn to live without the rest
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
I'll say goodbye to love
No one ever cared if I should live or die
Time and time again the chance for love has passed me by
And all I know of love is how to live without it
I just can't seem to find it
So I've made my mind up I must live my life alone
I'd say goodbye to love
There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine
Surely time will lose its bitter memories
And I'll find that there is someone to believe in and to live for
Something I could live for
All the years of useless search have finally reached an end
Loneliness and empty days will be my only friend
What lies in the future is a mystery to us all
No one can predict the wheel of fortune as it falls
There may come a time when I will see that I've been wrong
But for now this is my song
And it's goodbye to love
I'll say goodbye to love
And when he smiles he makes the sun shine
He wouldn't think to make it rain
Happiness runs in the family
And he's a boy from the good old earth and the high tree forest
And he's just about the happiest boy that I ever knew
And when he smiles he makes me sigh
He doesn't have a point of view
Happiness runs in the family
And he's a boy from the good old earth and the high tree forest
And he's just about the happiest boy that I ever knew
And when he smiles he makes the sun shine
And warms the day with morning dew
Happiness runs in the family
And he's a boy from the good old earth and the high tree forest
And he's just about the happiest boy that I ever knew
If I tell a joke you've probably heard it before
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
So I say thank you for the music
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
I wanna sing it out to everybody
Time won't stand by forever if I know it's true
And I've learned not to say never
Or else I'll seem the fool
When my lies may seem less than clever
Is when I fall for it
Only time will tell if wishing wells
Can bring us anything
Or fade like scenes from childhood dreams
Some rides don't have much of a finish
That's the ride I took
Through good and bad and straight through indifference
Without a second look
There's no intentions worthy of mention
Only time will tell if wishing wells
Can bring us anything
Or fade like scenes from childhood dreams
Poured the goldfish bowl into daddy's hat
Then I painted stripes down the family cat
Broke two teeth only yesterday
When I wear angel hair
But wait until he takes a spill
On halos on the stairs
Well I gotta go before the mailman stops
And he feels that glue in the letter box
I put on my angel gown
And oh did momma laugh
She didn't guess it was her best dress...
The one you tore in half
Hope that lump's gonna go away
Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no reason to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn
Then slowly turn away from me
Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
And if we're the victims of the night
I won't be blinded by light
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay with me
Through the tears of the day
You'll be on your way
When your restless eyes
And the blue shadows will fall
I shouldn't want to keep
If you don't want to stay
Until you're gone forever
When the clock strikes go
Then my tears will fall
And the blue shadows will fall
When we were teenagers
We went through a mean age
We think we know just what you mean
We were typical siblings
I think we can sing you this scene
Big brothers are supposed to be smart
Big brothers are supposed to have feelings
But most of the time they're numb
When we're looking for heroes
We usually find a clown
We're supposed to look up at them
Setting an awful example
We diagnosis them right for the local shrink
Big brothers are not as big as they think
We deserve some kind of loving cup
We're what every sister and brother should hopefully be
Put down your things and rest awhile
You know we've both nowhere to go
He was always halfway there you know
The same sad echo when you walk
It's the same as the same sad echo around here
I promise you this winter
I will worship you like gold
And ride your train forever
Electric fortunes to be told
And I don't want to question or even celebrate
All the joy you took and then gave back too late
It's the same sad echo when you lie
It's the same sad echo when you try to be clear
It's the same as the same sad echo around here
With a box of pills and you
I'm gonna keep my cool
Yes and in another world nothing was like this
There may have been a girl
There never was a kiss
The poison came in liquid
She was naked all the time
And no one could explain it
It was all between the lines
And I don't seem to trust anyone no more
It could be faith I'm just not sure
It's the same sad echo every day
Yeah the same sad echo another way
It's the same as the same sad echo most of all
Well you just got tired
You fell on your face most of all
And I don't want to mean anything to you
I don't want to tempt you to be true
It's the same sad echo all around in my ears
I Finally Found Someone
Barbra Streisand and Bryan Adams
The best things begin
It's better than it's ever been
It's all you had to say to take my breath away
Someone to share my life
My life has just begun
Just to know you were mine
I can't wait for the rest of my life
My life has just begun
You can see it in her letters on the paper with her pen
Her response is getting stronger I think she's coming round again
Tell me Mrs. Rita what's it say in my tarot
Read my palm and tell me why do lovers come and go
I just hope she's coming round again
I've been keeping myself busy with my books and with my tapes
Every day's much better since I've slowed my drinking pace
There's no swimming in the bottle it's just someplace we all drown
I lost myself in sorrow lost my confidence in doubt
I just hope she's coming round again
Get in the car and drive through town
Down the block and back around
Pretending that she's there with me we drive
My patience keeps me plaintive my high hopes keep me alone
My lover's will is shaken I wish she would just come home
So tell me Mrs. Rita what's it say in my tarot
Read my palm and tell me why do lovers come and go
It's the only thing that there's just too little of
There are mountains and hillsides enough to climb
There are oceans and rivers enough to cross
Enough to last until the end of time
It's the only thing that there's just too little of
There are corn fields and wheat fields enough to grow
There are sunbeams and moonbeams enough to shine
It's the only thing that there's just too little of
Des champions en crampons
There are billions of ants which wouldn't want to be forgotten by us
There are billions of ants which wouldn't want to be forgotten by us
For I would lay rest the grace in my tongue
Days like these are far too rare
To cheapen with heavy handed words
And so I'm afraid without any ado whatsoever
Born a stone's throw from this very stadium
And here before you now
Your picture has faded
Those hands lose their meaning
Those eyes have stopped seeing
Age kind of changed you
And change kind of aged you
Are worth holding on to
That goals are bullshit
I wish I could remember
The way you used to be
The dreams you spoke off
Were taking care of me
Mother you are worried
But trees are yielding
But songs lost meaning
But then why are you leaving
Because I've had enough
Some say shoot the moon
Some say let's show this world what we can do
Mother you are scared
But homes keep shaking
But bones keep breaking
But love keeps failing
But then what are you saying
Some say meet your maker
Some say enjoy the view
Where did all the good things
Where did all the nice things
Where did all the sweet things
Where did all the great things
Where did all the neat things
Where did all the right things
Where have all the good folks
Where have all the nice folks
Where have all the sweet folks
Where have all the great folks
Where have all the neat folks
Where have all the swell folks
I walk into a great line oh
I walk into a great line oh
I was born into a great life oh
I was born into a great life oh
I was born with hands covering both ears
I was born with hands covering both ears
My experience has led me here
My experience has led me here
I think that havoc should be raised
Drown the land and burn the sea
Don't spare a single life
If they beg just kill them twice
Cover miles and miles
Traverse with all your might
Chain the dogs and lose the keys
Blind their wicked eyes
Cross the creek in search of life
Sweep the tainted soil
You should have seen the way you
You should have seen the way you danced
With your smiling face
Oh how you really loved to dance
How could it ever change
You should have seen the way you
You should have seen the way you laughed
With my so called mood
It really never stood a chance
How could that ever change
It won't it will always
I'm gonna build me a home
It's gonna carry me down the river
I have no need for your money
I have no need for your friends
That every twitch has its consequence
Say hello to Alice for me
Tell her that I'm doing fine
So that when I am gone
I'm gonna stay here forever
I'm gonna build me a home
I tried to tell the world
I conquered every hole
Watched the leaves unfold
When does a good person
When does a bad person
He went to protect your innocents
From killing their own
Every night I have to carry him to the bathroom
You sure lost a lot of weight poor dad of mine
You sure lost a lot of weight poor dad of mine
You sure lost a lot of weight poor dad of mine
You sure lost a lot of weight poor dad of mine
Ever since he got home
You brought him medals and medicine
Every morning he will wake up looking pale and screaming
You sure lost a lot of weight poor dad of mine
You sure lost a lot of weight poor dad of mine
You sure lost a lot of weight poor dad of mine
I lay my head on the wheel
I lay my head on the wheel
I put it in third gear
I put in the third gear
I can be big in Japan
Beautiful cruelty year
Beautiful cruelty year
I put it in the first gear
So I can pick any color that I like
I'm gonna be a rainbow
Get me some rain and a ray of sunlight
I should have been a rainbow
Though I haven't figured out what to do at night
Guess I'll just be a rainbow
Disappearing out of sight
So I can play all the records that I like
I'm gonna be a jukebox
I should have been a jukebox
So you'd better put a coin right down my slide
Guess I'll just be a jukebox
You need a tune I provide
If I could just be thing I really really like me to be
Then maybe for once the odds will change and I'll finally know what it's like being me
So I can get lost with no place to go home to
I should have been a comet
Strolling around your stars and your moons
Guess I'll just be a comet
I'm lighting up the afternoon
If I could just stay the same and like the thing I'd want me to be
Then maybe for once the odds will change and I'll
Holding on to your feet
Of what you used to be
Hide and seek count till ten
Memory serves you well
Expect this expect that
Do not fear but be afraid don't rebel but just behave
If it is not explained then how do you justify It
The king raises his hand saying that he understands
And that he doesn't want to see more of his people dying
Cities to dust people to sand remember what the king once said
But while saying he was too busy lying
A crown makes a king a king makes a throne
And a throne makes the target for where to throw the stone
The elected hands of the world can only hold a few so think about that for a while
And then decide if they hold you
There is no point in pointing there are no need for needles no rules worth ruling no deeds worth doing
A crown makes a king a king makes a throne
And a throne makes the target for where to throw the stone
If you kind of hate my voice and if its making you depressed then please go home take a piss and get some rest
As the worn out young men can't cope with the temptation they start burning down the town out of anger and frustration
Making all the women and children cry they do not salute the ones who are about to die
A crown makes a king a king makes a throne
Thanks for sticking around
I love just enough to be loved
As you probably know by now
That your friends told you
I'm an impossible guy
Thanks for all you've done
You know that I'm not the talking type
Id rather put it in a song
They're helping us carry
They're helping us carry
The load that's been waiting
To explode in our faces
For letting it come this far
What if I'm wrong what if you're wrong
And does it really matter
Were both gonna be alone tonight
Oh my god what have I done
Oh my god what have I done
Ill call you when I'm done
Its time to lower the curtain
Behind us as we drift apart
They're helping us carry
They're helping us carry
The load that's been waiting
To explode in our faces
The promise of a child
Than a thousand of yours
But still you have a way with me
You'll always have your way with me
Are you having no fun
I wish this was about you
That I can't even remember
The lies on your face
But still you have that way with me
You'll always have that way with me
Worn out bruised and crippled
Designed by your favorite lie
You ask for forgiveness
For a way to mend the bridges
Surrounded by ashes of laughter
Somewhat out of place
Kind kind kind of kind to your
Who could have imagined
The ease with which it passes
The color returns to your face
Take your fear of the future
To strip the past of its sutures
Somewhat out of place
Kind kind kind of kind to your
I took apart a fragment of my mind
And held it underneath
And it won't hurt it'll just sting
Don't move keep still
Every crack every cut memorized
That ones yours and that ones mine
I can tell by their size
That may be the darkest sky I've ever seen
That may be the loneliest mountain ill ever meet
I look around the wasteland there's still time
To save this place and help it turn
It may turn out to have been
It may turn out that I needed
Lately I've been walking
Boring I'm kind of boring
It don't really mean nothing
It don't really mean nothing
Take it I can't take it
And maybe hell go nuts
It don't really mean nothing
Surely hell turn nuts
It don't really mean nothing
Who then should do the talking
Who then should do the talking
Stranger I'm a stranger
Walking ill just keep walking
Until I find myself a friend
Who thinks that I'm a nut
It might just mean something
Stand up straight stand up straight
Don't come crawling back to his door
The madness took over
My hands my eyes my moments
Every breath along the way
Got filled with spite and smelled like death
It dragged me home and into bed
So I left it up to the ancients
With every friend along the way
I got them drunk filled their heads
With words I borrowed from strangers
Teach me how to breathe
In the air I won't need
Stay with me till the end
Streets filled with terror
Eyes filled with venom
All the kids cry and weep
Is it real or could it be
The madness playing tricks on me
Suicidal yawns out of courtesy
The burning sensation of lonely cause
Ten crooked fingers but I just need one
The endless beginning of strangers in love
Teach me how to leave
All the things I won't need
Slowly I'm gaining speed
Would you please take over the wheel
It needs to stop I need to kneel
God if you can hear me
I think I kind of had enough
God can you hear me at all
God you used to tell me
That I was your favorite one
Yeah I'm okay go lets go
I know of a place down the road
Where they serve bread wine and more
Where they sing psalms songs and more
And where we can dance
So god if you're listening
I think you underestimate
God all the work that I've done
God you used to tell me
That I could do no wrong
Where followers swear and curse
Where the believers pray till it hurts
Where all the sin gets drowned in its thirst
Where your name gets blessed by the cursed
Your kingdoms locked its gates are shut
Lets tear those pearly gates down
God wont you come and join the living
That's the long term effect of not having any common sense
Happy endings are just a myth something to help deal with it
My luck has changed over time it got sick of being called mine
I'm a lazy lion in its cage barred from the dying day
You have all inspired me to keep on moving
And finding out what I can do
I hope to be just as much of an inspiration
To others so they can find their happiness within themselves
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book
But I do know that I love you
What a wonderful world this could be
I can win your love for me
What a wonderful world this could be
What a wonderful world this could be
What a wonderful world this could be
Time keeps on slipping into the future
I love my dog as much as I love you
All he asks from me is the food to give him strength
All he ever needs is love and that he knows he'll get
All the pay I need comes shining through his eyes
I don't need no cold water to make me realize that
I love my dog as much as I love you
I love my dog as much as I love you
Be walking along that lonely mile
I keep seeing this picture of you
And it comes as no surprise to me
And you're forever talking on the phone
I tried to call you names
But every time it comes out the same
And it comes as no surprise to me
I'm still waiting for your heart
You'll be mine to hold each day
But till then this is all I can say
And it comes as no surprise to me
And it comes as no surprise to me
Better bring another bottle with you baby
If you really want to party then lets make it swing
Right into the morning
Better bring another bottle with you baby
I feel cold and I want to get you by my side
I feel bold and I want to show you how this man can ride
Better bring another bottle with you baby
If you really want to party then lets make it swing
Right into the morning
Better bring another bottle with you baby
I feel smooth and I really want to live it up
If we groove then I promise you that we won't even stop
Better bring another bottle with you baby
I get the feeling that you want to take off and fly
We'll burn up the sky
I feel smooth and I really want to live it up
If we groove then I promise you that we won't even stop
Better bring another bottle with you baby
I get the feeling that you want to take off and fly
We'll burn up the sky
Better bring another bottle with you baby
Better try to bring another bottle now
Better bring another bottle baby
Getting hung up all day on smiles
Yellow ties and old brown suits
Growing old is my only danger
Lampshades of old antique leather
Or the boots made out of feathers
I'll keep walking miles till I feel
A broom beneath my feet
Or the hawking eyes of an old stuffed bull across the street
It'll be broken down to litter
Everyone know that that dress will never fit her
Getting hung up all day on smiles
Yellow ties and old brown suits
Growing old is my only danger
Lampshades of old antique leather
Or the boots made out of feathers
I'll keep walking miles till I feel
A broom beneath my feet
Or the hawking eyes of an old stuffed bull across the street
It'll be broken down to litter
Everyone know that that dress will never fit her
Getting hung up all day on smiles
Yellow ties and old brown suits
With a yellow ribbon in her hair
And I want to make sure she's not cold
Where silk music plays out in the country out of the way
And we'll be riding on top of the world
With a yellow ribbon in her hair
Baby get your head screwed on
Baby you'll be out of your mind.
And I know what you're going through
Baby you'll be out of your mind.
And overnight you've seemed to change
Since you kissed your psychiatrist
Baby get your head screwed on
You were always were so nice
When it came to problems you knew
I never did think twice about ever coming to you
You always straightened me out
When I was feeling rough
But this one I really doubt
Cause this one's really tough
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard
I know you run around and you'll never settle down
And I should quit while I'm still on top
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard
He sleeps alone in the damp
And rests his head upon a door
Turned up collar and worn out shoes
He sleeps alone in the damp
And rests his head upon a door
No companion to take him home
His only friends are the kind that just leave him alone
No one knows just how lonely his life has been
In a world that lives in a dream
He sleeps alone in the damp
And rests his head upon a door
I take you out all over town
I wanna see that twinkle in your eyes
There's a yellow flower by your bed
Oh there's a hummingbird singing.
Oh there's a hummingbird singing.
There's a shadow where you once lay.
When the life that I was shown started crumbling
Then a lady made an Earl of this poor boy.
I've been demoralized too many times
I'm gonna get me a gun
I'm gonna get me a gun
And all those people who put me down
You better get ready to run
I know my destiny is like the sun
You see the best of me when I have got my gun
I'm gonna get me a gun
I'm gonna get me a gun
And all those people who put me down
You better get ready to run
So you think you can push me around and make me run
I'm gonna get me a gun
I'm gonna get me a gun
And all those people who put me down
You better get ready to run
School is out now we're gonna have some fun.
We're gonna make like we are the only ones.
I'm gonna buy a piece of the sky and sell passing clouds
I'm gonna be a mayor of some small town and tax the crowds
We're coming out of school today and we're so happy to be alive.
I'm gonna be a history maker I'll call myself Richard the Third.
We're coming out of school today and we're so happy to be alive.
But when they're wiping their silver spoons
When my little kitty gets out
There's gonna be a party
And if my mind isn't coming so fast
The men on the block say I'm on the brink
And if my mind isn't coming so fast
And I ain't so dumb as some people think
Palming the men for some bread
I could lay my head on a piece of lead
And imagine it was a springy bed
Soon I'm gonna slip away
I could lay my head on a piece of lead
And imagine it was a springy bed
Soon I'm gonna slip away
Soon I'm gonna slip away
Soon I'm gonna slip away
In the night I'm gonna slip away
I could lay my head on a piece of lead
And imagine it was a springy bed
And when that bird sings from over that silver wall
And with this gun goes everything I want to say
And when that bird sings from over that silver wall
Slowly let me tell you a story of a tree
Once in a summertime garden lived a little apple tree
And the man who owned it wanted it to be picked
So he sent forth to hire me
But a never in my traveling days
For it will bring you down
If it ever sees you wearing a frown
Frightened that they might be plucked
And every time that somebody passed
All except that one little apple ducked
But a never in my traveling days
For it will bring you down
If it ever sees you wearing a frown
When I'll smash your heart
You played with me like a toy
When I'll smash your heart
When I'll smash your heart
And that once I was a famous archaeologist named
In a recent expedition in a distant land.
I just happened to be passing my hand in the sand
And then it started to disappear
And without a friend a desert is a lonely place.
I was just about to turn around and make way home
When something told me that I had to see it again.
And then it started to disappear.
I would have given you all of my heart
But there's someone who's torn it apart
And she's taking almost all that I've got
The first cut is the deepest
The first cut is the deepest
I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
The first cut is the deepest
The first cut is the deepest
The first cut is the deepest
I've been pushed around
It is time for me to start to grow
I'm gonna see things right
And you will be my bride
That my time will come
I will show the world what I can be
I'm gonna see things right
And you will be my bride
Love does funny things
Strength to carry through
And to make my name a pride to use
I'm gonna see things right
I'm going home to the town where I was born
Where little children laughed as they sang
My daddy will be waiting there
My sister will be combing down her silver hair
In the blackness of the night
I seem to wander endlessly
With a hope burning out deep inside
I'm alone and there is no one by my side
In the blackness of the night
I see a shadow passing by
From the heels of an old soldier boy.
There's no compromising
And his eyes are black as the sky
He's alone and there is no one by his side
In the blackness of the night
I see a sparkle of a star
From the sweet silver tear of a child
When her parents were happy she was too young to know
She's alone and there is no one by her side
I'm alone and there is no one by my side
In the blackness of the night
I seem to wander endlessly
With a hope burning out deep inside
It's lonely at the wooden lodge
You haven't seen her for so long
There in the back woods
We had our little piece of land
But everything wasn't so groovy
Not when you had to dirty your hands
It's lonely at the wooden lodge
So why don't you share my bed
I should have known better
And if they came again
I'd do the same again
And as I walked through the park where we used to play
They wont ever disappear
And if they came again
I'd do the same again
You left me wearing nothing but a shell
You left me wearing nothing but a shell
I thought that you loved me
I thought that you loved me
But then I never could tell
This feeling you left me
If you loved me like you said that you did
And you think that you've found true happiness
There's no method in your mind
And your tempers are kind
I'm an unexpected visitor who's dropped in for tea
But I'm not so low you don't even know that I'm here
The view from the top can be oh so very lonely
And you can be missing such a lot that could be yours
Why am I always trying to be like somebody else
Why bother flying high above you
The view from the top can be oh so very lonely
There'll only be myself to blame
You know I'd love to hold you tight
And love you all the night
Why bother flying high above you
The view from the top can be oh so very lonely
Well here comes my wife
And that's the story of my life
She haunts me though she don't want me
She follows badly in disguise
But money doesn't make him better
It just makes him better to be there
Well here comes my wife
And that's the story of my life
She haunts me though she don't want me
She follows badly in disguise
She's coming up behind me
Well here comes my wife
And that's the story of my life
She haunts me though she don't want me
She follows badly in disguise
Throwing bombs as they do
See the funny side of it
They're heading straight for you
See the funny little holes they're making
Looking like craters on the moon
See the funny side of it
We'll be living in them soon
But it's getting pretty near the end
So there's never anything to spend
See the funny little flying saucers we found
Painted up just for you
See the funny man inside
His color matches too
See the silly little camera he loves
Shooting pictures with all day
See the funny side of it
His friends are on their way
But it's getting pretty near the end
So there's never anything to spend
But somehow it just doesn't help
It only makes it worse
With only solitude to meet me like a friend
Across the raging torrent of the sea
And she knows I'll always be...
How can I live without the love I cannot see
I know there's someone there
Behind the silence of the dark
But I know that I won't see
Till we open up our eyes together
And she looks so light
I could fly her through the night
But somehow it just doesn't help
That what you never miss
But I have loved you from the moment that we knew
And even though you've never been to school
But then you change your mind
And I know you're never gonna come back for me
And though you said you loved me
And said you needed all of my love
Maybe if the weather was just a little better
It might not have happened that way
I'll wake you tomorrow
But your heart seems so silent
I'll wake you tomorrow
You look so cold tonight
Your lips feel like winter
I'll wake you tomorrow
But your heart seems so silent
Though in your grave you lie
I'll always be with you
Though in your grave you lie
I'll always be with you
Now maybe you're right
And maybe you're wrong
But I ain't gonna argue
I've done it far too long
It was getting so good
I can't think about it no more
But now there ain't nothing
But regretting everything we do
I put up with your lies
Like you put up with mine
But God knows we should have
We could have taken the time
You know you don't have to pretend
It'll never happen again
It won't happen again
It'll never happen again
So maybe you're right
And maybe you're wrong
But I ain't gonna argue
I've done it far too long
It was getting so good
I can't think about it no more
But now there ain't nothing
Yes I'm going to be a pop star.
Yes I'm going to be a pop star.
I think I would have been a sad man all my life.
Coming through me giving me a second sight.
I think I would have been a sad man all my life.
Coming through me giving me a second sight.
You're eating my heart away
And there's nothing much left of me.
I have drunk you wine.
You have made yours worth mine
I don't want no more of you
So won't you be kind to me
I have seen your face
And It's to much for me today.
You have made me a wreck
I have seen your eyes
And I can see Death's disguise
Now won't you leave me in my misery.
I don't want no fight
But it won't be lonely for long.
But it won't be lonely for long.
But it won't be lonely for long.
It's just another point of view. Ooh...
A state of mind I'm going through. Yes...
So what I see is never true. No...
The secret of good and the secret of bad.
That bad was good and good was bad. No...
I wish I knew the mystery of
That thing called hate and that thing called love.
Time rise. Time fall.
Words just words don't know
Back ... I'm going back...
And in the morning when you filled my eyes
And so my mind begins to memorize
My legs are weak my heels are low.
I'm just a coaster but my wheels won't roll.
Can't make no headway on this road.
My legs are weak my heels are low.
I'm just a coaster but my wheels won't roll.
Can't make no headway on this road
And in the morning when you fill my eyes
Back up on the mended road
Taking time to check the dial
I never knew her name
But she'll be passing my way sometime again.
I raise my hand and touch the wheel
Taking time to check the dial
I never knew her name
But she'll be passing my way sometime again.
Or taking a ride on a cosmic train.
Switch on summer from a slot machine.
For your lorry loads pumping petrol gas.
But will you keep on building higher
I'm looking for a hard headed woman
One who will take me for myself
And if I find my hard headed
Woman I won't need nobody else
I'm looking for a hard headed woman
One who will make me do my best
And if I find my hard headed woman
I know the rest of my life will be blessed
I know a lot of fancy dancers
People who can glide you on a floor
I know many fine feathered friends
But their friendliness depends on how you do
They know many sure fired ways
To find out the one who pays
I'm looking for a hard headed woman
One who will make me feel so good
And if I find my hard headed woman
I'm looking for a hard headed woman
One who will make me do my best
Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you wanna start something new
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breaking my heart in two
Because I never wanna see you a sad girl
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
And It's hard to get by just upon a smile
She hangs her head and cries in my shirt
She must be hurt very badly
You're lost in the dark you can trust me
Though my love wants to relieve her
She walks alone from wall to wall
Though I know she likes to be near me
She sits in a corner by the door
There must be more I can tell her
If she really wants me to help her
I'll do what I can to show her the way
And maybe one day I will free her
Though I know no one can see her
I guess I'll take my time
Look up at the mountain
Lord my body has been a good friend
But I won't need it when I reach the end
Guess I'll take my time
I creep through the valleys
And I grope through the woods
It's gonna make me feel good
So don't it make you feel sad
I can make my own rules
Lord my body has been a good friend
But I won't need it when I reach the end
I Guess I'll take my time
Don't want to work away
One day you'll have a job like mine.
Nobody should be that poor.
I don't want to work away
But I might die tonight.
Hold on to the shore.
Mary dropped her pants by the sand
But the soul of nobody knows
Where the parson goes.
Would sleep well at night
With everything emptying
Stands ready to strike
And everything emptying
To see what I could find out.
I left my folk and friends
With the aim to clear my mind out.
Well I hit the rowdy road
But on the way I wonder
Telling me I have to hurry.
I listen to the robin's song
Hoping someone would miss me.
But some times you have to moan
But nevertheless you know
The seconds tick the time out.
Then I found my head one day
So why not take a look now
It's not time to make a change
There's so much you have to know
If you want you can marry
I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
When you've found something going on
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not
When I do he turns away again
It's always been the same
From the moment I could talk
I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way and I know
That I have to go away
It's not time to make a change
There's so much you have to go through
If you want you can marry
All the times that I cried
Keeping all the things I knew inside
But it's harder to ignore it
Now there's a way and I know
That I have to go away
Wine for the woman who made the rain come.
To the wind of my soul
Only God really Knows
I've sat upon the setting sun
But never never never
I never wanted water once
But they fall far below
I let my music take me
Where my heart wants to go
I've swam upon the devil's lake
But never never never
I'll never make the same mistake
You'll be my sky above
You'll be my day and night
You'll be mine tonight
You'll be my sky above
You'll be my day and night
Maybe I can forget the chance
Maybe I can forget the plans
Maybe I can recall the way
Don't you feel a change a coming
From another side of time
Breaking down the walls of silence
Lifting shadows from your mind
Placing back the missing mirrors
That before you couldn't find
Filling mysteries of emptiness
That yesterday left behind
And we all know it's better
Now let's all start the living
For the one that's going to last
Yes we all know it's better
Now let's all start the living
For the one that's going to last
Don't you feel the day is coming
That will stay and remain
When your children see the answers
That you saw the same
When the clouds have all gone
There will be no more rain
And the beauty of all things
Don't you feel the day is coming
And it won't be too soon
When the people of the world
Can all live in one room
When we shake off the ancient
Shake off the ancient chains of our tomb
We will all be born again
But I can't think of right words to say
And I long to tell you that I'm always thinking of you
I'm always thinking of you
But my words just blow away
Always ends up to one thing honey
And I can't think of right words to say
I'm always walking with you
But I look and you're not there
I'm always talking to you
And I'm sad that you can't hear
Sad that you can't hear
It always ends up to one thing honey
When I look and you're not there
Need to feel my arms around you
Feel my arms surround you
Like the sea around the shore
Each night and day I pray
And hope that I might find you
And hope that I might find you
Because hearts can do no more
It always ends up to one thing honey
Still I kneel upon your floor
But I can't think of what's right to say
I long to tell you that I'm always thinking of you
I'm always thinking of you
It always ends up to one thing honey
If I make a mark in time
I can't say the mark is mine
I'm only the underline of the word
I can't tell you what to do
Like everybody else I'm searching through what I've heard
Show me what I haven't seen to ease my mind
I wouldn't make another demand all my life
All in all it's all the same
Searching for the question why
But if he tries to rule the sky he must fall
The humdrum of the city grows
Reaching out beyond the throes of our time
Do our best to break the ground
Try to turn the world around one more time
Do our best to break the ground
Try to turn the world around one more time
Like the first morning
Praise for the singing
Praise for the morning
Praise for them springing
Sweet the rain's new fall
Like the first dew fall
Praise for the sweetness
Sprung in completeness
Born of the One Light
Like the first morning
Praise for the singing
Praise for the morning
Praise for them springing
Of going round and round.
But only up and down.
I gave my last hope to you.
Looking at the horizon
For my light to dawn.
Summers come and gone.
I gave my last chance to you.
I've done all one man can do.
I gave my last chance to you.
And if I ever lose my hands
I won't have to work no more
And if I ever lose my eyes
If my colors all run dry
Yes if I ever lose my eyes
I won't have to cry no more
And if I ever lose my legs
Yes if I ever lose my legs
I won't have to walk no more
And if I ever lose my mouth
Yes if I ever lose my mouth
I won't have to talk...
I asked the faithful light
Thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun
Dreaming about the world as one
And I believe it could be
Someday it's going to come
Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Come take me home again
Thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun
Glide on the peace train
Come on the peace train
Everyone jump upon the peace train
Come on the peace train
Get your bags together
Go bring your good friends too
Because it's getting nearer
It soon will be with you
It's not so far from you
And it's getting nearer
Soon it will all be true
Glide on the peace train
Thinking about the world as it is
Why must we go on hating
Why can't we live in bliss
Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Come take me home again
Glide on the peace train
Come on the peace train
Everyone jump upon the peace train
Somewhere not so far from here
All I know is all I feel right now
I feel the power growing in my hair
Sitting on my own not by myself
Everybody's here with me
I don't need to touch your face to know
And I don't need to use my eyes to see
I keep on wondering if I sleep too long
And keep on wondering if I sleep too long
Oh I'm on my way I know I am
But times there were when I thought not
Bleeding half my soul in bad company
I thank the moon I had the strength to stop
I'm not making love to anyone's wishes
Only for that light I see
That's gonna be the only thing that's left of me
And if I make it to the waterside
And if I make it to the waterside
Somewhere not so far from here
All I know is all I feel right now
I feel the power growing in my hair
Oh life is like a maze of doors
And they all open from the side you're on
You're going to wind up where you started from
It is you who I wish to share my body with she said
We'll find a dry place under the sky with a flower for a bed
And for my joy I will give you a boy with a moon and star on his head.
Her silver hair flowed in the air laying waves across the sun
We left the road and headed up to the top of the Whisper Wood
And we walked till we came to where the holy magnolia stood.
And there we laid cool in the shade singing songs and making love...
With the naked earth beneath us and the universe above.
So while she was asleep I kissed her cheek for cheerio.
The wedding took place and people came from many miles around
But out of all that I recall I remembered the girl I met
A year had passed and everything was just as it was a year before
As it was a year before...
I got down on my knees and kissed the moon and star on his head.
As years went by the boy grew high and the village looked on in awe
They'd never seen anything like the boy with the moon and star before.
And people would ride from far and wide just to seek the word he spread
She moves like and angel
And seven evening stars
Dance through the window
Of her universal house
Of her universal house
Her voice a crystal echo
Lies humming in your soul
So patiently awaiting
For your ears to behold
For your ears to behold
She ripples on the water
Leaves diamonds on the shore
And fish from every distance
Watch her ocean cellar door
Her breath a warm fire
In every lovers heart
A mistress to magicians
And a dancer to the gods
And a dancer to the gods
Her clothes are made of rainbows
And twenty thousand tears
Shine through the spaces
Ooh my babe I want you
And on my life I swear
My conscience will I follow you forever
If you meet me everywhere
All my dreams have blown away.
When the heart is young and the night is done and the sky is blue.
Sing a song of love and truth.
And the world was new.
For your work has just begun.
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue
And the people I saw were the people I know
And they all came down to take a view
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue
And it stung my tongue to repeat the words
That I used to use only yesterday
Meanings just dropped to the ground
I tried to remember what I thought
And what I used to say
Oh my hands were tied as I struggled inside
The empty waste of another day
Memories were blank to my eyes
The fire and the glory of that night
Seemed safely locked away
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue
And the people I saw were the people I know
And they all came down to take a view
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue
But my head felt better as I turned the car
And the airport slowly came to view
One mile said the sign
Checked my bags and made it straight to End Gate 22
And though my body's back I know it can't be real
The house of freezing steel
When my eyes were weak from the light of the morning
Oh sister won't you tell me what a man might want to know
A cold plate of lamb and cold potatoes too
Now what's a soul to do
I made my mind up then to get me to the wheel
He said we're Venus bound
Oh please take me home
After all I'm only human and the Earth is where I belong
I must have looked pitiful to this freak without a face
And though my body's back I know it can't be real
The house of freezing steel
I don't want to lost it here in my time
Wearing a warm wool shawl wrapped around her shoulders
As we drank down the wine to the last Sweet Scarlet
How was I to wonder why or even question this
Underneath her kiss I was so unguarded
Every bottle's empty now and all those dreams are gone
A gypsy with a grin from and old far away country
She could move mountains in the dark as silent as a knife
She cut loose a life that she never no never really wanted
All those days are frozen now and all those scars are gone
I want you so to know there's no bridge between us
It's so quiet in the ruins walking though the old town
Stones crumbling under my feet I see smoke for miles around
So nice to see you coming back in this town again
It's nice to see a friendly face come peeping through having tea
Ah but it's all changed winter turned on a man
Came down on day when no one was looking and it
And nobody... helping no one else
So nice to see you coming back in this town again
It's nice to see a friendly face come peeping through
You'd better know what you're going through now
You came back here to find your home is a black horizon
You'd better walk on the side while you're still walking
Just keep on walking on down the street keep your distance
From the people you meet. Oh Lord and you'd better watch your eyes
Where's it leading to freedom at what cost
People needing more and more and it's all getting lost
Back to the time when the earth was green
And there was no high walls and the sea was clean
Because the meaning still leaves for you to choose
Dreams I had just last night
Fortunes come and fortunes go
I have a friend that I have met
Who gives me love and a certain respect
That means you... you...
And in a little while our love will spread
Ain't no matter who inside this world you know
There'll he someone who will love you just for who you are
Dreams I had just last night
Made me worried to face up to the light
Come on now it's freedom calling
Come on over and find yourself
Come on now it's freedom calling
Come on in and remind yourself
But it's in my heart that's where it's taking place
And I couldn't stand to let it go to waste
No man can ever get enough
But maybe one day we'll all die in love
Take my love that's all I have at hand
Please say you will ... Don't say you can't
Oh Will you Will you Will you
The moment you walked inside my door
Heaven must've programmed you
The moment you fell inside my dreams
Heaven must've programmed you
You can live in the largest house
And eleven apartments too
Run your own private plane
And I think about you sometimes
But when you're with me boy it chokes my mind
Come on now it's freedom calling
Come on over and find yourself
Come on now it's freedom calling
Come on in and remind yourself
Man must fight for freedom sure that's what most other people would say
Look for a body to lead them but there's too many to lead them away.
Come on now it's freedom calling but there's only one freedom for you.
And I can't wait to be with you tomorrow night.
Won't you give me your word that you won't laugh
And I'd hate to face a day without you around
My life would be without sound
And the sky all glistens with gold
When you're talking to me
And the whirling wind turns to song
Why it sets my soul free
There are no words. I can use
Because the meaning still leaves for you to choose
So you ride around in your car. switch on the radio
You want to relate to something you once read in a book
What kind of a way to try to take a look
I didn't think of this until I got hurt
But the tears you shed are only in your eye
Between his jokes and his karma chewing gum
I didn't think of this until I got hurt
Turn your heart to the bright sun
Love will come your way
You'll never know what love you've been missing
You say you want to seek the truth but you work alone
No one to help you and nobody to push you on
I'd like to help you brother but that would be wrong
I didn't think of this until I got hurt
How many times must I get up
Look out and see the same old view
How many times must I wear the same old things
How many times must I clean this face my face
How many times must I drink the same old drink
And dream the same old dreams that I do
There ain't nothing that could ever ease the pain
But for your line and mine
I want that loving again
How many times must I pass your place. your place
How many times must I see the same old things
When all I should be seeing is you
There ain't nothing that could ever ease the pain
But for your line and mine
I want to talk it out with you
Try to get my message through
That's not all I want to do
I want to feel your body close
From your head down to your toes
Maybe help you fold your clothes
We're meant to live and love together girl ... Oh babe
I want to talk it out with you
Try to get my message through
That's not all I want to do
Dead snakes and poisoned wisdoms between our teeth
And on this night there'll be no peace
And when they're done we will be the voice
Across the bare face of the sleeping lake
And in this way you will awake
And silently soak up the day
And in this way you will awake
And in this way you will awake
And this way you will awake
Pick up the pieces you see before you
Don't let your weaknesses destroy you
You know wherever you go the world will follow
So let your reasons be true to you
Stay close to your friends up until the end
And when they know that you feel the same way
Rise up and be free and die happily
And in this way you will awake
And in this way you will awake
Yesterday I was on the edge
Hoping everything was going to work itself out
A good honest man doing the work of God
Trying to make things better for Him
A lover of life in a school for fools
Trying to find another way to survive
Sweet Music can lighten us
To help make myself richer
You know you're still living
Take a look at the world
Think about how it will end
There'd be no wars in the world
If everybody joined the band
Think about the light in your eyes
Think about what you should know
If everybody joined in the show Oh Oh
Think about the light in your eyes
Think about what you should know
If everybody joined in the show
You're only dancing on this earth for a short while
And though your dreams may toss and turn you now
They will vanish away like your daddy's best jeans
And the patches make the goodbye harder still
There'll never be a better chance to change your mind
And if you want this world to see a better day
Will you carry the words of love with you
Will you ride the great white bird into heaven
And the goodbye makes the journey harder still
You're only dancing on this earth for a short while
And the world it will bloom
Cause sun lights the sky
And the sun lights the moon
All the happy trees are green
The light in your dream
Sit you down young gentlemen
There's something I want you to know
You keep on asking me
You keep on asking me why
It started a long time ago
Me and your mum on the night
I was on the road again
Ill never never forget
Ill never forget that night no...
We met in a back road
She had the best figure by far
Huh a thousand hours I've looked at her eyes but I
Me and your mum on the night
I was on the road again
She was a junkie then
And I was having a good time
Back on the road again
Oh momma I was on the road again
Ill never never forget
Ill never forget that time
Back on the road again
I was a pop star then
Down at the ghost town
Bill Bailey said he'd be around
If Mrs. G. Robinson would just put
Lovely Queen Anne Boleyn
Everybody's waiting for us
Down at the boom town
O. Redding and Washington
In the Kitchen with mum
Buster Keaton and King Tut
They used to call him Jesus
They're still calling him Jesus
They crossed the wood and hanged him
They still misunderstand him
And in the evening his love will lead the blind
In every secret corner there in your mind
They called him Gautama Buddha
He turned the world to order
He used to sit knowing
Where you and me were going
I love I love I'm ready to love yes
I love I love I'm ready to love yeah
I love I love I'm ready
To ready to ready to love
I love I love I'm ready to love yeah
You keep me awake with your white lily smile
Don't keep me watching your charms all the while
Cause as all the wise men say
Grab it if it comes your way
I love I love I'm ready to love yeah
I love I love I'm ready to love yeah
You make me feel things I've never felt before
Help my baby eyes and open up the door
You make me real to everyone and everyday I
I thank the Lord that you came along this way
Its no more an illusion than I can say
I love I love I'm ready to love yes
I love I love I'm ready to love yeah
I love I love I'm ready
He was the king of trees
A deep green guard of young
We used to meet by him
Far from the hustling town
Now they've come to cut you down... down
He was the guardian of
Beneath the shade he gave
Oh Lord how it's empty now
With nothing save the breeze
Now they've come to burn the leaves
Don't burn the leaves
And if my mind breaks up in all
And if my body falls inside
The forest and the evergreens
As I roll down the track
The forest and the evergreen
The forest and the evergreen
He was the king of trees
The way he lightened my life
We used to meet by him
Oh don't say those same idle lies
I've heard them before
This fool who left half his heart on an early train
Those same weeping eyes
I'll wipe them no more
I didn't want to have to be cruel
But the truth must be said
And you ain't heard enough
Oh it was not so long ago
Since you wandered out of here
To become a silver model
So don't choke me with your lies
Because this man has open eyes
All those sneaky bars and smart parties
All those sweet friends and lovers
All those lonely rooms
And I want you I want you no more
I want you I want you no more
Oh don't say those same idle lies
I've heard them before
This fool who left his heart on an early train
Come the morning I'll be far from here
Slowly rising in another sphere
Home in the sky in the morning bye bye
Stars are crying over my old house
But I'm still breathing happy above the clouds
All of the bad times are past
Music is a lady that I still love
Music is a lady that I still need
Come the morning I'll be far from here
Slowly rising in another sphere
Like a drunken guillotine
Lingering just above my head.
Dark and empty was the place to which I'd come.
Cold and silent was the house my name was on.
Nine rooms and a tomb in every one.
So dark and empty was the place to which I'd come.
All at once my bones began to change.
Sweet as rain falling on the snow.
Can't see no need for Nine no more
Now it's too late to open the door.
What kind of demon is this
With every word he says
That I can't fight no more
And nails me to the floor
Can make me turn and see
Why I don't see them about
They're all around him now.
I see this stranger had the key
Can make me turn and see the way I really am.
Go on and let him in.
A simple job to do and nothing more.
I see this stranger had the key
Kick out your dull padded life
They were only mirrors you imagined in your mind
Now that you've got no place to go
Know that there's just one place to be
Like streams that seek the ocean they will find ways through
Throw down your mask and be real
That was just a cycle like a squirrel in a wheel
Now that you've got no place to look
Know that's there's just one place to be
You say you're really with me but you only follow me around
But I don't want the kind of love
I have to sit down and count
You think you're free and lucky but you're stuck behind a prison wall
How well you know yourself
But I see something else within you
That you don't see at all
Never never never give up
Like streams that seek the ocean they will find ways through
Well I ain't got nothing.
But it don't worry me
Well I ain't got nothing
And to nothing I belong
Yet you won't find me wrong
Well I don't house no past
My sun doesn't rise from under the sea
There is only one morning
Well he says he hasn't got nothing
But he seems to possess less
He waltzed through the door
Well I don't eat a lot
I do work for nothing so
If there's a job I can fill the gap
Once you've decided to trust me with time
You won't need to look back...
But it don't worry me
Home on a breeze we blow
Each one heading for a different place
Each behind a different face
Home where the days are long
And no one ever has to grab
Giving everything they have.
Forever forever your lamp will burn
Forever home forever would that you'd learn
That you came with nothing
So with nothing you'll return
You know you're not alone
That you feel so out of place.
Forever forever your lamp will burn
Forever home forever would that you'd learn
That you came with nothing
So with nothing you'll return
Home where you never ask why and
One is the ever blazing star
Sword of the immortal world
Out star is ever rising
Born of the eternal lamp
Mighty burning mountain
The everlasting love of one is
One is one is one is one is one is
One is the ever kindling star
King of the immortal spark
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
When we had imaginings and we had
All kinds of things and we laughed
Oh and I remember you
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
When we had simplicity and we had
Warm toast for tea and we laughed
Oh and I remember you
It ain't never too late to learn about love
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
When we had imaginings and we had
All kinds of things and we laughed
Oh and I remember you
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
When we had simplicity and we had
Warm toast for tea and we laughed
Oh and I remember you
It ain't never too late to learn about love
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
When we had imaginings and we had
All kinds of things and we laughed
Life you make it what it is
Love can change it with a kiss
Love can take you by the hand
Love can drop you where you stand
But still you want to have it all
You like to live it up
But still you want to have it all
I thought you had enough
But still you want to have it all
I thought you had enough
Life you make it what it is
Love can change it with a kiss
She can turn your head around
He can lift you off the ground
But still you want to have it all
You like to live it up
But still you want to have it all
I thought you had enough
But still you want to have it all
I thought you had enough
Love you make it what it is
Life can change it with a kiss
People polishing guns
They've got nothing better to do
Though they think they're having fun
All day long they sit at home
Waiting for the milk to come
Watch them turn into stone
You really missed the point
Everybody's got to know
Love's the reason we're here
No matter which way you go
Love's gonna meet you there
I can't budge baby I can't move without your
I don't know honey that's the truth what laid
Now some folks said it's no good to smoke in bed
Promise me you won't ever leave or I would die
Yeah but since you touched me I can't hide it
I've been so delighted with you
Now some folks said it's no good to smoke in bed
But I just take off my clothes and I jump into
I only wanted a little bit of love
So I could put a little love in my heart
So I could ring a small bell in your heart
I never wanted to be a star buy my mum a
So I could win a small place in your heart
I only wanted a little bit of love
Guarantee you we'll have a good time
Making love under the stars
I feel the earth move when I'm in your arms
Got the River Nile in my veins
The white rabbit falling into space
Let yourself go and have a good time
Making love under the stars
I see the lights dance when we're holding hands
It's like magic being with you
All the simple things that you do
All the little things
Let yourself go and have a good time
Other people come and go
They try to make it through
I have to smile and tell them no
If you let me down boy I'd be so small
Everybody needs a friend
To brighten up their world
I know you'll never let me down
I want to see you round every turn
You're my world far as I'm concerned
Got no time to runabout
Who ran full of laughter
I was a child who lived for today
My eyes full of sunshine
My heart full of smiles
I was a child for a day
Who sang in the morning
Who laughed at the sun
Who listened to those who spoke with their wisdom
We're getting older as time goes by
A little older with everyday
We were the children of yesterday
We are the men who worry of nothing
We are the men who fight without aim
We are the pawns in the game
We're getting older as time goes by
A little older with everyday
We were the children of yesterday
Who ran full of laughter
I was a child who lived for today
My eyes full of sunshine
My heart full of smiles
I was a child for a day
We're getting older as time goes by
A little older with everyday
I remember standing here
Right on this first same side
I was dying but for you
It was just another night
You once wrapped me in your world
You bought me my first shoes
I was just another lonely child
Oh and you were much amused
So you took me and you dressed me well
All for your friends to see
There was no more left in me
Then you walked out and you cut me cold
Out on a road somewhere
And I still have no idea
But everybody needs a friend
Sometimes you need a little help
You once held me in your arms
You made me feel so right
I was flying but for you
It was just another night
But everybody needs a little help
Whether or not you think you really do
Everybody needs a little help
Now the time has come for you
I ain't looking to fight no wars
No more talking trash
I'm not seeking anymore pain
If you should come around
In the daytime time for celebration
No use looking down if it's over here
It's a world a new creation
And the golden light of the morning
Makes it easy to comb your hair
And the love of a child
It's the time of the year
In the daytime you can move a mountain
With a blink of your eye
Now it's over here now it's over there
It's a world with no complications
And the curtains on the window
Start blowing like your hair
And the love that I feel
Mysterious moon found me crying in the dark
Heard my footsteps on the stairs
Mysterious moon found me crying
But the sun dried my tears
In the daytime time for celebration
No use looking down children open your eyes
It's a world a whole nation
Now the white boats have landed
And the innocent are here
So dream for the child
Looks like I'm heading for a breakdown
I must be heading for a breakdown
We must be heading for a breakdown
We hit the road at ninety miles an hour
Heading for Frisco Bay
Now we got to get away with our
Looks like were heading for a breakdown
We climbed out and she began to shiver
And you've got yourself a breakdown
Looks like we've got ourselves a breakdown
Oh Randy if they knew
I think they'd take me sway
Just for loving you you
All alone in my own quiet way
Cause that's the way that I want it
Wish I could see you now
You and your cherry black eyes
My heart would never lie down down
Cause that's the way my arrow flies
And that's the way that I want it
You never said it would rain
You only told me that the sun would come again
You never said it would rain
It wouldn't mean a thing
It wouldn't hurt me a bit
Cause only you can break my wings
And that's the way that I want it
You drew my face in the sand
And ever since that day you made me what I am
You drew my face in the sand
There's nothing I wouldn't give
To live with you for good
And that's the way that I want it
Please don't treat me this way
I see our love slipping away
Did you think you could just put me down
Maybe I don't want you
Don't leave me out in the cold
Like somebody you don't know
Did you think that you could just walk away
Anytime you wanted to
Maybe I don't love you
Did you think that you could just put me down
Cause nobody can love you girl like I do
Every little bird in the sky
Would sing a song of love
If you would just take me back
Come on open up your heart again
Stop fooling yourself
I know your show too well
Did you think that you could just shake my hand
Maybe I don't want you
Oh and as you go through life
It's the little things that come back again
If you came back again
Is it true what they say
The things that make rain in my eyes
Are they real or are they lies
You know I hear so much about you now
To go on a little boat with you
Talk about the scheme of things
On a little boat with you
Or give me the chance to follow you home
I am your son but I wish I knew you
Were you lonely as a boy
You know I'd give so much to see you now
Pick a little stick and walk with you
Talk about the scheme of things
On a short walk with you
You give me just a little hope
I feel something out there reaching for me
Won't you take me with you
And away from this place
Because it gets so cold and lonely here
To sit on a little rock with you
Talk about the scheme of things
On a small rock with you
Show me show me show me the way
Before they grind me down
Send me power not to be afraid
And when I close my eyes
Let me see you once in the light
Is it true what they say
New York poor New York
New York poor New York
Cars choking your child to death
But you don't wanna see
Cause you only think about yourself
New York poor New York
Sniper on the rooftop New York
New York poor New York
Not fit for a dog in New York
Everybody bites on the Big Apple
Leave the hungry in tears
But no one gives a damn no one really cares
How they feel they're just paper people not real
You need a gun to walk into New York
Now you're broke and you're out on a ledge
Who can help you this time
Now you're down to your very last cent
New York poor New York
Who turned the lights out in New York
New York poor New York
Just another blackout in New York
Girl dead on the 26th floor
But no one knew her name
Found her body behind the door
Too young for the game
New York poor New York
Devils in the subway New York
New York poor New York
New York poor New York
Harlem touching midtown New York
New York poor New York
Money's getting tighter New York
I know there'll be another time
There's going to be another moment
There'll never be another you
There's going to be another story
There's so much left for you to do love
There'll never be another you
There's going to be another spring
And it won't always be winter
And it'll always be spring
There's going to be another kingdom
There's so much left for you to know love
There'll never be another you
Will be there when you need me
Darling you'll Just have to say
But you know I'll be there anyway
Gut to have faith in yourself
I know there'll be another spring
And it won't always be winter
And it'll always be spring
There's going to be another story
There's so much left for you to know love
There'll never be another you
There'll never be another you
In the blackness of the night
I seem to wander endlessly
With a hope burning out deep inside
I'm alone and there is no one by my side
In the blackness of the night
I see a shadow passing by
From the heels of an old soldier boy.
There's no compromising
And his eyes are black as the sky
He's alone and there is no one by his side
In the blackness of the night
I see a sparkle of a star
From the sweet silver tear of a child
When her parents were happy she was too young to know
She's alone and there is no one by her side
I'm alone and there is no one by my side
In the blackness of the night
I seem to wander endlessly
With a hope burning out deep inside
Slowly let me tell you a story of a tree
Once in a summertime garden lived a little apple tree
And the man who owned it wanted it to be picked
So he sent forth to hire me
But a never in my traveling days
For it will bring you down
If it ever sees you wearing a frown
Frightened that they might be plucked
And every time that somebody passed
All except that one little apple ducked
But a never in my traveling days
For it will bring you down
If it ever sees you wearing a frown
And when that bird sings from over that silver wall
And with this gun goes everything I want to say
And when that bird sings from over that silver wall
I could lay my head on a piece of lead
And imagine it was a springy bed
Soon I'm gonna slip away
I could lay my head on a piece of lead
And imagine it was a springy bed
Soon I'm gonna slip away
Soon I'm gonna slip away
Soon I'm gonna slip away
In the night I'm gonna slip away
I could lay my head on a piece of lead
And imagine it was a springy bed
Now that I've passed your test
How can I prove to you baby I'll never let you down
But I never meant to worry you... no
Now that I've kissed your breast
How can I prove to you baby I'll never make you sad
And mountains turn into sand. I love you
And the song that I sing is the only way that I can explain
You know I wish for you baby nothing but good times ahead
Thought the time may change and snowmen sleep in the sea
And I really only want you to want me. I love you
And the song that I sing is the only way that I can explain
Now that you've shown your heart
Flying on the power of love. I love you
Though time may fade and mountains turn into sand
I love you and the song that I sing is the only way that
Two fine people should love each other
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I got in town a month ago
That's how I'm in the state I'm in
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
Another fella told me
He had a sister who looked just fine
To a cat named Frankenstein
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
When he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey to help me spend my money
I'm gonna have to blow this town
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
My love can get on its feet
And that's something no one else can beat
Must've done us some good
Made me love you much more than I could
Just like you used to do
I tell if you love me too
Blue Monday how I hate Blue Monday
Got to work like a slave all day
I'm so tired got no time to play
And Friday I get my pay
All my tiredness has gone away
Got my money and my honey
And I'm out on the stand to play
But it's worth it for the time that I had
But I've got to get my rest
Don't wear fear or nobody will know you're there
Just lift your head and let your feelings out instead
Love is where all of us belong
Don't wear fear or nobody will know you're there
And don't wear fear or nobody will know you're there
Just lift your head and let your feelings out instead
I want to be your honey man
To wash your clothes and hold your hand
But all of your money and stuff
Just isn't enough to buy what I can give
When things get rough
And all of your friendliest friends
You know I'll give you the world
I'll sacrifice girl anything
I'd like to live in a wigwam
Yes I'd like to live in a wigwam
I'd like to live in a wigwam and
Dance round the totem pole
I'd like to live in an igloo
I'd like to live in an igloo
I'd like to ride on a caravan
I'd like to take a ride on a caravan
And sing with the gypsies
I'd like to live on a commune
I'd like to live on a commune
And people can call me a hippie
I don't want to live in a palace
Oh I don't want to live in no palace
There's too many empty rooms
And I don't want to live in a barracks
Don't want to live in a barracks
Oh I don't want to live in a barracks
And wake up to the bugle tune
Listen to the sound of the birds
And be fed bread through the bars
I'm glad I'm alive am I
I'm glad I'm alive am I
I'm glad I'm alive am I
We gotta get our heads up in the sky
We gotta get our heads up in the sky
We gotta get our heads up
We gotta get our heads up in the sky
We gotta get to heaven get a guide
We gotta get to heaven get a guide
We gotta get to heaven
We gotta have a guide
I buy the nicest things
From a supermarket store.
Vitamin land and marzipan
And I know just what they're all for.
I've organized my useless life in a way
I've never done before.
Because I've got a thing about
I just can't wait to see
That city on the moon
With air conditioned gardens
That'll play your favorite tune.
I'll see my feet upon that street
If it's the last thing that I do.
Because I've got a thing about
I'll see my feet upon that street
If it's the last thing that I do.
Because I've got a thing about
The night was long and lonely
I took a walk along the dark
Didn't know quite what to do
So with the stars above my head
I let the silence set inside me and guide me
If only mother could see me now
On the white horse silver cloud
If only daddy could see me ride
He'd be so proud of this little devil boy
And all the people that I'd loved
If only mother could see me now
On the white horse silver cloud
If only daddy could see me ride
He'd be so proud of this little devil boy
On the white horse silver cloud
If only daddy could see me ride
You know that there are
You know that there are
You can do what you want
And if you find a new way
You can make it all true
And you can make it undo
You only need to know
You know that there are
You know that there are
You can do what you want
And if you find a new way
You can make it all true
And you can make it undo
You only need to know
You know that there are
You know that there are
You know that there are
You know that there are
In the land of free love and goodbye
And the love lives in the sky
In the night flies a team of white horses
And they glimmer clean in your eye
And the song lives in the sky
The trees grow higher than the mountain
In the land of free love and goodbye
One day the sun will come down from the sky
Winter will fly and I won't feel cold
Gardens will light up with bright dapple horses
I go just where I want to and I won't be lead around
I'd like to try today but then I'm much too small for the crown
Animals will travel from distances far
Lead by a star to beat in my door
All kinds of strangers will come with no dangers
White velvet angels will sleep on my floor
I go just where I want to and with both feet on the ground
I'd like to try today but then I'm much too small for the crown
I go just where I want to and with both feet on the ground
So you ride around in your car. switch on the radio
You want to relate to something you once read in a book
What kind of a way to try to take a look
I didn't think of this until I got hurt
But the tears you shed are only in your eye
So you turn to any phony mouth with a tale to tell
Between his jokes and his karma chewing gum
I didn't think of this until I got hurt
Turn your heart to the bright sun
Love will come your way
Because till you make that final show
You'll never know what love you've been missing
You say you want to seek the truth but you work alone
No one to help you and nobody to push you on
I'd like to help you brother but that would be wrong
I didn't think of this until I got hurt
The long and winding road
That leads to your door
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
The many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back
You left me standing here
Don't leave me waiting here
But still they lead me back
You left me standing here
Don't keep me waiting here
