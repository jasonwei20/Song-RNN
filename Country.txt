Another two months on the road
Just two more miles I'll be home to what I know
Where things move a little slower
And people always wave goodbye and say hello
Just imagine all the stories they could tell
And the country folk just out to raise some hell
Where my neighbors are my friends and the story never ends
All of yesterday has come and gone
And so you try to pick up all the pieces
Put it all back the way that it belongs
Ain't it good to know that no matter where you go
That this town has got your back when you are gone
Where my amendment rights keep me safe at night
Where my neighbors are my friends and the story never ends
Where my amendment rights keep me safe at night
Where my neighbor's are my friends and the story never ends
And the story never ends
Another two months on the road
If I could walk on water like Jesus did before
If I knew all the answers to keep you coming back for more
If I could paint a picture and then cut off my own ear
Because we run in vicious circles
Until we're dizzy with disdain
If I could write a poem and find the perfect words
And then put them all to music just so my voice gets heard
Because we run in vicious circles
Until we're dizzy with disdain
So if I could walk on water like Jesus did before
Because we run in vicious circles
Until we're dizzy with disdain
We're running in vicious circles
Until we're dizzy with disdain
Now I grew up down an old dirt road in a town you wouldn't know
My pops picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks back in 1964
But a war is known to change a man and the whiskey's known to change a man
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go
In a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy is all I'll ever be
You could lose a couple pounds
And a couple extra pounds never really hurt
I've got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck
And my idea of Heaven's chasing white tail bucks
Now two flags fly above my land and really sum up how I feel
The other one's got a rattlesnake with a simple statement made
I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And a country boy is all I'll ever be
You're the pills that take away my pain
You're the light that helps me find my way
In this world where nothing else is true
Here I am still tangled up in you
I'm still tangled up in you
Still tangled up in you
You're the fire that warms me when I'm cold
You're the hand I have to hold as I grow old
You're the shore when I am lost at sea
You're the only thing that I lack about me
In this world where nothing else is true
Here I am still tangled up in you
I'm still tangled up in you
Still tangled up in you
How long has it been since the storyline begin
And I hope it never ends and goes like this forever
In this world where nothing else is true
Here I am still tangled up in you
I'm still tangled up in you
I sit here on the stairs and listen to
The nighttime as the daylight fades away
It's such a haunting and familiar tune
And when I hear it in the distance I can say
That I'm home in Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me
The North shore is where my father lives
But the Berkshires are where my heart is
And when I see them in the distance I could cry
Because I'm home in Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me
And Zoe's just the perfect mix of me and you
To think about it makes your daddy wanna cry
So I just passed the sign that welcomes me to Worthington
Established long before this country came to be
A place that hasn't really changed with time
The way this country that I love it used to be
Because I'm home in Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me
Because I'm home in Massachusetts
Where my hero teaches classes everyday
And where my friends they don't treat me different
Now I grew up down an old dirt road in a town you wouldn't know

And this highway ain't no place
All these hotels and bars
And rides in stretched cars ain't for me
And this highway ain't no place
All these hotels and bars
And rides in stretched cars ain't for me
And this highway ain't no place
All these hotels and bars
And rides in stretched cars ain't for me
There's a thousand miles in eighteen hours
I got to double drive down south by 35
I got the hammer down Detroit made
5 25 pushing my ass right down that line
And that smell of burning diesel fuel
Just tells me that I'm back out on the road
I got a full grown creeping out on my tail
And I won't make bail in that small time jail
I got the bird dog on radio cranked
Gear jamming lane changing son of a bitch
And that smell of burning diesel fuel
Just tells me that I'm back out on the road
Just left the jail with a hand full of pills
And I won't quit till I hit the coupe in Abilene
I'm almost there there's just a few more miles
I'll make the drop and I'll turn and burn
And that smell of burning diesel fuel
Just tells me that I'm back out on the road
And that smell of burning diesel fuel
Ain't it funny how they sing along
Makes you smile just a little bit
These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the moon is bright
What a way to save my soul
Now we're at our little getaway
Fresh trapper on the wheel tonight
Cherry stones straight out the shell
These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the moon is bright
What a way to save our souls
There's no traffic at the tollbooth line
And my three girls know every line
These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the music's right
What a way to save our souls
I've walked a mile in the shoes of a broken man
I've fallen down a thousand times and got up again
There's times I've talked to God likes he's my only friend
You gotta slow it down a little bit
I've borrowed pages from the life of Johnny Cash
I've tried to find the answer in a whiskey glass
I've done a lot of things back in my shady past
You gotta slow it down a little bit
As I sat there on that cold metal bed
How I wound up here again
You gotta slow it down a little bit
Another cheap high rise hotel room
Another place another show
Another meaningless destination
Another time to hear a dial tone
And I can feel it when we touch
Another time to miss a birthday
Another time to miss my flight
And what I thought I might
I can see it in your eyes
And I can feel it when we touch
Now I'm lying beside you
A stranger in your arms
We drift apart together
And come back like a storm
Another show up Decatur
Another one in San Antone
Somewhere else in this equator
Takes me far away from home
I can see it in your eyes
And I can feel it when we touch
It sits above the mantel on a couple rusty nails
The good Lord only knows all the stories it could tell
He bought it new out of the Sears Roebuck catalog
And it shot a many a shells over the back of an old bird dog
And it backed a burglar down when grandma took the safety off
It's just an old double barrel twelve
I can still hear his voice when I put it to my shoulder
He taught me a whole lot more than how to hunt
And one of these days I'll pass it on to my grandson
He handed it to me on the day I turned thirteen
With a half shot box of shells and a kit to keep it clean
I keep a picture in the case of that sweet old man and me
It's just an old double barrel twelve
I can still hear his voice when I put it to my shoulder
He taught me a whole lot more than how to hunt
One of these days I'll pass it on to my grandson
That I got with a box call and granddaddy's gun
There's a shot up sign out there on forty nine
It sits above the mantel on a couple rusty nails
I just left out of Corpus
And I'm heading into Nashville for the day
I've worn the tires off this bus ten times
I've carried contraband across state lines
I've played concert halls and holes in walls
And places that a show just shouldn't be
There's stadiums and late night shows
On every major network on TV
And I've worn the tires off this bus ten times
I've carried contraband across state lines
And then I'm coming home
I can take this guitar off my back
And I've worn the tires off this bus ten times
I've carried contraband across state lines
I've followed yellow lines till I can't see
And all the things that I've said and the road up ahead
I wish I was anywhere but here
There's always footsteps from behind me
And all the time I've spent rewinding
All the things that I've said and the road up ahead
I wish I was anywhere but here
The bed next to me is empty
The things put in life to tempt me
And all the things that I've said and the road up ahead
Wish I was anywhere but here
The things I've been through
And the angels won't take me away
And I've talked to Saint Peter
So it looks like I'm going today
They'll be wailing and will lay as well
And the devil will be dealing
The cards as they lay
So let's have a party in hell
But the angels won't take me away
The bartender only serves
And that sure sounds like heaven to me
And Rick James will bring all the cocaine you want
So let's have a party in hell
They'll be No Show and Junior and Merle
And this highway ain't no place
All these hotels and bars
And rides in stretched cars ain't for me
And this highway ain't no place
All these hotels and bars
And rides in stretched cars ain't for me
And this highway ain't no place
All these hotels and bars
And rides in stretched cars ain't for me
Another cheap high rise hotel room
Another place another show
Another meaningless destination
Another time to hear a dial tone
And I can feel it when we touch
Another time to miss a birthday
Another time to miss my flight
And what I thought I might
I can see it in your eyes
And I can feel it when we touch
Now I'm lying beside you
A stranger in your arms
We drift apart together
And come back like a storm
Another show up Decatur
Another one in San Antone
Somewhere else in this equator
Takes me far away from home
I can see it in your eyes
And I can feel it when we touch
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm OK
But that's not what gets me
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And not seeing that loving you
It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade give away all the words that I saved in my heart
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was trying to do
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was trying to do
If I could walk on water like Jesus did before
If I knew all the answers to keep you coming back for more
If I could paint a picture and then cut off my own ear
Because we run in vicious circles
Until we're dizzy with disdain
If I could write a poem and find the perfect words
And then put them all to music just so my voice gets heard
Because we run in vicious circles
Until we're dizzy with disdain
So if I could walk on water like Jesus did before
Because we run in vicious circles
Until we're dizzy with disdain
We're running in vicious circles
Until we're dizzy with disdain
Now I grew up down an old dirt road in a town you wouldn't know
My pops picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks back in 1964
But a war is known to change a man and the whiskey's known to change a man
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go
In a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy is all I'll ever be
You could lose a couple pounds
And a couple extra pounds never really hurt
I've got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck
And my idea of Heaven's chasing white tail bucks
Now two flags fly above my land and really sum up how I feel
The other one's got a rattlesnake with a simple statement made
I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And a country boy is all I'll ever be
So I sit here in my hole
I hope the Lord can come save my soul
Darkness surrounds me and I can't see
All of the demons right here with me
All of the damage brought on by me
I'm a sinner to my core
What a sad state of affairs I'm in
Ain't country just because I'm old enough to know that
That's a natural fact
It's full of tales of good times and happy endings
My life ain't like that
Full of pain and heartache and desperation
And the ones that got away
The ones that speak to me
That's a natural fact
It's full of tales of good times and happy endings
My life ain't like that
Full of pain and heartache and desperation
And the ones that got away
The ones that speak to me
And Junior's got a cold one in his hand
And Haggard sings the songs that'll save your soul
That's a natural fact
It's full of tales of hard times and complications
Full of pain and heartache and desperation
And the ones that got away
The ones that speak to me
The ones that speak to me
There's a bottle... on the dresser by your ring
And it's empty... so right now I don't feel a thing
But I'll be over it by noon
That's the difference... between whiskey and you
Come tomorrow... I can walk in any store
It ain't a problem... they'll always sell me more
But your forgiveness... well that's something I can't buy
There ain't a thing that I can do
That's the difference... between whiskey and you
At times I wonder... if they ain't both the same
And one's a liar... that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's a long gone bitter truth
That's the difference... between whiskey and you
I've got a problem... but it ain't like what you think
But if I don't break down... and bring it on myself
It'll hit out of the blue
That's the difference... between whiskey and you
At times I wonder... if they ain't both the same
And one's a liar... that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's a long gone bitter truth
That's the difference... between whiskey and you
We grow tobacco and we drive trucks
And drive our four wheelers down the main road
And bust out the sleds when it's cold
We got tailgates on a Friday night
And it's a half hour from my front door
What you all don't understand
It ain't all about a Southern man
We love our whiskey and we love our homegrown
We wear square toes and Chippewa boots
And we all know where we come from
And we'll be right here when it's done
What you all don't understand
It ain't all about a Southern man
We got pride and a sense of what's good
And we all got dirt on our hands
Get up early and we work third shift
Pay our taxes and protect our kids
And we all got dirt on our hands
You got your Chevy parked next to my Ford
You got a Bible but I'll see you in hell
What y'all don't understand
It ain't all about a Southern man
We got pride and a sense of what's good
And we all got dirt on our hands
Get up early and we work third shift
Pay our taxes and protect our kids
And we all got dirt on our hands
My mama always told me
And she said she was sorry
For all the times she couldn't save my soul
Before I packed up and I walked right out that door
But I feel like I could conquer the whole world
When I look up and see those three little girls
All my pieces glued together for the world to see
Till there's nothing left of me when all is said and done
Now a preacher man once told me
All my pieces glued together for the world to see
Till there's nothing left of me when all is said and done
So my mama always told me
I've seen old timers pray to their beer
And we all seem to have our sad stories to tell
That's how we all ended up here
And I just ain't got that kind of time
Because it fills up the cracks in my soul
And it helps me forget all the damage I've done
And all the time I've spent down in this hole
And for a moment I swear I hear Jesus
It's like Sunday every Saturday night
Now the gospel comes out of that jukebox
And an angel just walked through the door
And she pulled up the chair right beside me
Because it fills up the cracks in my soul
And it helps me forget all the damage I've done
And all the time I've spent down in this hole
And for a moment I swear I hear Jesus
It's like Sunday every Saturday night
Now the barstools are lined up like church pews
Because it fills up the cracks in my soul
And it helps me forget all the damage I've done
And all the time I've spent down in this hole
And for a moment I swear I hear Jesus
It's like Sunday every Saturday night
I've been shattered and broken for most of my life
But I've done pretty good with a job and a wife
Got a family that loves me and a good piece of land
But these things that I do
So just tell me you love me and tell me you'll stay
And you'll watch over this house while I go away
And just promise to be here when I get back home
So we can start where we left off all those years ago
Lost and lonely out here on the road
I'm an albatross hanging around my own neck
I'm a hard one to handle and I've played the fool
But these things that I do
So just tell me you love me and tell me you'll stay
And you'll watch over this house while I go away
And just promise to be here when I get back home
So we can start where we left off all those years ago
Lost and lonely out here on the road
So just tell me you love me and tell me you'll stay
And you'll watch over this house while I go away
And just promise to be here when I get back home
So we can start where we left off all those years ago
Lost and lonely out here on the road
I'll watch it all go down in flames
Another vice to kill the pain
The hands of God still hold me and help me through this life
I'm haunted by the words you said
This holy war inside my head
Is probably not the safest place to be
The hands of God still hold me and help me through this life
So as the darkness turns to day
The light it shows the depth of my disguise
My safety was naivety
Created by deception and with lies
The hands of God still hold me and help me through this life
I'm stuck in these shoes
And I ain't a hero or role model material
And I'm stuck in these shoes
I'm just not really sure
How much further they'll go
And sometimes I still feel all alone
And sometimes I still feel I won't make it through this on my own
And I ain't here to save ya
And sometimes I still feel all alone
And sometimes I still feel I won't make it through this on my own
When I die I'll go to Heaven
Because I've spent my time in Hell
I've never claimed to know the answers
But I've faked it pretty well
And I've walked straight through the valley
Full of shadows and of death
And I've learned a lot of lessons
But they haven't killed me yet
And right now the only thing that's left is sadness and the shame
Now I've heard so many stories
Full of sadness and regret
And I've learned a lot of answers
To the things I didn't get
And right now the only thing that's left is sadness and the shame
Now somewhere in my darkness
There shined a little light
A chance for me to be forgiven
But I couldn't get it right
So when I die I'll go the Heaven
Because I spent my time in Hell
I never claimed to know the answers
Two days past eighteen
He gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
So they went down and they sat on the pier
I've got no one to send a letter to
Our love will never end
Never more to be alone
So the letters came from an army camp
And all of the things he was so scared of
And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile
Our love will never end
Never more to be alone
One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read that nobody really cared
But the pretty little girl with a bow in her hair
Our love will never end
Never more to be alone
Our love will never end
Never more to be alone
She's so afraid to kiss
And so afraid to laugh
She's so afraid of love
And so afraid of hate
She's so afraid to kiss
And so afraid to laugh
She's so afraid of love
And so afraid of hate
She's so afraid of it
She's hiding behind her mask
She's so afraid of pain
And so afraid of blame
And you bring me to my knees
All these times that I could beg you please
All the times I felt insecure
And I leave my burdens at the door
I can see through you
I can see through you
All the times that I felt like this won't end
And I taste what I could never have
All those times that I've tried
And I waste more time than anyone
But I'm on the outside
I can see through you
I can see through you
All the times that I've cried
And I feel all this pain
And I lie here in bed
And I feel tomorrow will be okay
But I'm on the outside
I can see through you
I can see through you
And the best thing to do right now is get up and go
All you'll find here is a fight
And two wrongs don't make a right
The only pill you need to swallow is your pride
Just hop back in your truck
Turn the key and fire it up
There are better ways to get over her lies
Than to aim your headlights into her bedroom window
And throw empty beer cans at both of their shadows
Even if she broke your heart
And tore your world apart
There's no need to wish them both the best
Endless love and happiness
Or give her satisfaction
Of justify her actions
Head up to the lake tonight
Tie one on and throw a light
All five horizons revolved around her soul
As the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed
And now my bitter hands
Shake beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
I take a walk outside
I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter
And now my bitter hands
Of what was everything
All the love gone bad
Turned my world to black
There's too many of you crying
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
We don't need to escalate
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Simply because our hair is long
To bring some understanding here today
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Tell me what's going on
Thought I'd pictured every vision that a man could dream about
And stepped down off that cloud
What's an angel like you doing in my wildest dreams
Did you come here tonight just to rescue me
What's an angel like you doing in my wildest dreams
I thought I'd died and went to heaven when you sat down next to me
You look like you belong in a Sunday school choir
What's an angel like you doing in my wildest dreams
Did you come here tonight just to rescue me
What's an angel like you doing in my wildest dreams
What's an angel like you doing in my wildest dreams
Did you come here tonight just to rescue me
It was a quarter till three on the day that we met
Well I tried my best but I still can't forget
How good she used to be
And it's just too bad I've got a good memory
Good memories are hard to leave behind
I still love her but she don't love me
And it's just too bad I've got a good memory
Left a love light burning that I can't turn off
Her first impression left a lasting thought
That keeps coming back to me
And it's just too bad I've got a good memory
Good memories are hard to leave behind
I still love her but she don't love me
And it's just too bad I've got a good memory
And it's just too bad I've got a good memory
Everyone that knew him knew which side that he'd be on
For what he thought was right
You've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name
But we always had plenty just living his advice
And I know that things are different than they were in Daddy's day
But I still believe what makes a man really hasn't changed
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
I parked my car beside the highway and I didn't lock the doors
And this road that's going nowhere just leads me on and on
As I ask myself with every step will I ever be alone
I wonder just how far it is over you
Is there no place I go that you don't come too
Now I wonder how far it is over you
I was deep in California when I finally made a friend
And it was me and that old hobo till you showed up again
Then he ran out of liquor and I've run out of time
And I'm staring at the water so blue and deep and wide
Bet a man could lose a memory over on the other side
I wonder just how far it is over you
Is there no place I go that you don't come too
Now I wonder how far it is over you
I parked my car beside the highway and I didn't lock the doors
Then I spied this piece of paper it looked like a list of things to do
But when I got down to number six I realized we were through
The dog's at the vet the hearing is set
Do you see what I'm trying to say
Now you can't sugar coat what she really wrote
Ain't that a hell of a note
But she went by the numbers and I got counted out
The dog's at the vet the hearing is set
Do you see what I'm trying to say
Now you can't sugar coat what she really wrote
Ain't that a hell of a note
It's taken me some time to read the writing on the wall
But I have finally figured out just what's been going on
And I need to tell you what I've learned before you turn to go
There's things about that other man I think you should know
The man that came between us was looking out for number one
He didn't care how bad he hurt you by the selfish things he'd done
That man that came between us was me
I know I'm sorry don't make up for half the tears you've cried
And I can't promise miracles but I swear to God I'll try
And that stranger's gone for good
The man that came between us was looking out for number one
He didn't care how bad he hurt you by the selfish things he'd done
That man that came between us was me
You're looking at a man that's almost gone
Had a good woman and I went and did her wrong
She moved me from her heart to the back of her mind
She made a memory out of me
Just a vision of the past is all you see
Like a statue of stone a part of history
I don't even make a shadow when I'm walking in the sun
She made a memory out of me
Just a vision of the past is all you see
Like a statue of stone a part of history
Just a vision of the past is all you see
Like a statue of stone a part of history
I've had my back against the wall more times than I can count
Seems I was running into trouble every time I turned around
I've never been up against anything quite like you
I've never been up against anything quite like you
A picture perfect afternoon
Chirping out a happy tune
Got a reason for feeling this way
Since you've been gone things look so wrong
The sky's got the blues today
Loving all this warm sunshine
Not a worry on their minds
And I ain't gonna stop until I forget it all
All my tin can buddies that help me ease the pain
One by one they remind me she's not coming back again
Just how long she's been gone I can't say I really know
I don't need a watch or a clock on the wall
To tell me just how long it took for me to lose it all
One by one they remind me she's not coming back again
Just how long she's been gone I can't say I really know
From men nearly twice my size
But I've always survived
So when I take a look at all I've took
It don't seem right to me
How a little bitty woman with just a few words
Come bring me to my knees
Sticks and stones wouldn't hurt a bit
As the sound of your goodbye
I'm to blame sure enough
It's like you say there ain't a woman made
That can live without true love
So if it's too late to set things straight
That'll end this misery.
Sticks and stones wouldn't hurt a bit
Somewhere out there in the smoky air
Where the night is neon blue
One drink could lead her to
I can't be far behind her
Before my angel is gone
Looking for my blue angel
The same one that flew from my arms last night
If you see my blue angel
Tell her that heaven without her feels like hell tonight
Last night when she left I told myself
That she wouldn't go too far
Now I'm not so sure how long her tears
Could last in a stranger's arms
She's wounded I know and feeling so low
She could fall at anytime
I don't know what I'd do if I were to lose
That precious angel of mine
Looking for my blue angel
The same one that flew from my arms last night
If you see my blue angel
Tell her that heaven without her feels like hell tonight
When I look back on this life
And all the things that I have done
But now that I've had time alone
And I've been through every page
There's only one part of my story
That I wish that I could change
If I had it to do over
And I knew then what I know now
I'd do anything I had to
To keep you from walking out
Your love would be the only reason
For anything that I'd undo
There are bridges I have burned
There are promises I've made
And the ones that I have broken
I'll have to carry to my grave
And when I stand before the judge
And answer for my every deed
The only one that I'll regret
Is what I've done to you and me
Yes if I had it to do over
And I knew then what I know now
I'd do anything I had to
To keep you from walking out
Your love would be the only reason
For anything that I'd undo
If I had it to do over
More than once she's left me on the side of the road
She's riding me around on four bald tires
The wipers don't work and the horn don't blow
She ain't a Cadillac and she ain't a Rolls
I got stopped by a cop late last night
I asked her last time that I took her out
She ain't a Cadillac and she ain't a Rolls
Escaped some early graves by the skin of my teeth
All the deepest secrets of my soul the world can plainly see
That reminds me of mistakes that I've made
And no story I can tell can tell it quite as well
And read between the lines
And read between the lines
They might be hard to find on this rigid face of stone
There are pleasant deep impressions that are solid as gold
Like roads on a map they cross a battered stretch of skin
You can trace your way through memory lane to anywhere I've been
That reminds me of mistakes that I've made
And no story I can tell can tell it quite as well
And read between the lines
And all the tough stuff it takes to fill a man's shoes
Then God put this heart in me for you
It pushes the blood through my veins
To swing this nine pound hammer one more day
But there's only one reason why it beats so true
God put this heart in me for you
This heart really don't belong to me
This heart will be yours eternally
If I had to walk through this world alone
Without this heart in me for you
This heart really don't belong to me
This heart will be yours eternally
God put this in my for you
You reach out and touch me and tell me you love me
And promise that you always will
But as I start to kiss your tender lips
I wake up to my living hell
Your heavenly memory is pure misery
I'm losing my mind one night as a time
When sleep comes I hold you just like I used to
In a world where our love still lives
When I lose you all over again
Your heavenly memory is pure misery
I'm losing my mind one night as a time
If you're lost and you're alone
Let me sing you a song
I can sympathize with you
I was born with a broken heart
Born to lose right from the start
That's why I sing the way I do
A sad six string and a jukebox voice
I'm the lonely people's choice
I was made to play the part
I was born with a broken heart
If the sun should ever shine in your life
And may you leave behind these old troubled times that we've shared
I'm where I'm supposed to be
And anywhere there's a lonely street I'll be there
I was born with a broken heart
Born to lose right from the start
That's why I sing the way I do
A sad six string and a jukebox voice
I'm the lonely people's choice
I was made to play the part
I was born with a broken heart
I've walked the straight and narrow and I've worn a rebel's brand
And I wouldn't have it any other way
I wouldn't have it any other way
I could have taken a beaten path every time trouble starts
And I wouldn't have it any other way
I wouldn't have it any other way
I used to smoke and stay out late
Sometimes I drank more that I ate
I took a walk on the wild side
I guess I'm lucky that I survived
I had some days I can't forget
I've settled down now
There was a girl I do recall
She was as tough as she was tall
We used to dance to every song
She used to call me her honey baby
I wonder if she's still around
I've settled down now
She's been staring out the window four nights in a row
And she just can't resist when she feels the pull
She's got a restless spirit that she can't control
She hears the call of the wild every once in a while
She can turn it loose and howl
When she winks at me and smiles
Love making state of mind
Just more of a woman at times like this
And Lord knows I got my hands full tonight
She hears the call of the wild every once in a while
She can turn it loose and howl
When she winks at me and smiles
Love making state of mind
I'm a mild mannered man who pulls his weight
Then I disappear until the weekend's through
And you'll never guess who I turn into
Dancing on the tables
And swinging from the chandeliers
That's who I really am
Everybody's waiting for my next move
Last night I broke the record for acting a fool
My favorite waitress said I went a little too far
When I came roller skating down the top of the bar
The never should have bet me that it couldn't be done
Dancing on the tables
And swinging from the chandeliers
That's who I really am
Dancing on the tables
And swinging from the chandeliers
Drank and cried and I walked the floor
And her memory's backed me against the wall
So tonight I'm gonna end it all
You can say goodbye to this lonely guy
There's a lovesick man on the prowl tonight
I gotta have another she to rescue me
There's a lovesick man on the prowl tonight
I gotta have another she to rescue me
But you've gotta get it started if you wanna get it done
You set your mind and roll up your sleeves
With your heart in your hands and the sweat on your brow
You build the things that really make the world go around
You bet your bottom dollar it was made right here
Now there ain't no shame in a job well done
From driving a nail to driving a truck
As a matter of fact I'd like to set things straight
If you wanna cram course in reality
There ain't no trophies or cheering crowds
You'll face yourself at the end of the day
And be damn proud of whatever you've made
Can't hang it on the wall for the world to see
Now there ain't no shame in a job well done
From driving a nail to driving a truck
As a matter of fact I'd like to set things straight
If you wanna cram course in reality
I had dreams that were bigger than the Montana sky
And we were gonna do great in Great Falls
I just knew we were this time
You'll never know how bad that hurt
When I promised you the world
I lost the farm in Kansas
Along with a lot of pride
Then I almost lost my life
Down in that West Virginia mine
And that motel room in Memphis
Was a long way from diamonds and pearls
And that sure ain't what I meant
When I promised you the world
I swear your love is stronger
Than any dream of mine I've ever drug you through
They just never did come true
You've always bet on this old gambler
Every time I gave the wheel a whirl
But this ain't what I meant
When I promised you the world
On another broken dream of mine
And I guess that mansion on the hill
Is pretty hard to see tonight
But as long as there's a breath of life in me
When I promised you the world
I swear your love is stronger
Than any dream of mine I've ever drug you through
They just never did come true
You've always bet on this old gambler
Every time I gave the wheel a whirl
But this ain't what I meant
When I promised you the world
Just a skinny little Mississippi railroad man
That loved to sing and play
He brought his music from the cotton fields
To the the hillbilly hall of fame
Thank God for Jimmie Rodgers
Chisel his name in the cornerstone
I just wish he could've lived to see the day
When country took the throne
Now a million songs have come and gone
Since we made that humble start
Love and broken hearts
And more and more folks
Kept tuning in and turning on
Now I can proudly say that I saw the day
When country took the throne
They can't get enough of this country stuff
And they're screaming for more
We painted the town with that grand old sound
And the whole world sang along
When country took the throne
But I bet my best guitar
There'll be a jukebox jumping on Jupiter
In the last frontier they'll stand and cheer
The best music ever known
They'll celebrate that age old day
When country took the throne
They can't get enough of this country stuff
And they're screaming for more
We painted the town with that grand old sound
And the whole world sang along
When country took the throne
I said I was there the day
And you cute little smile's driving me hog wild
But that's enough about me
Let's talk about the way I love your walk
Talk about the way that I love your talk
Did I happen to mention that I love everything you do
That's enough about me
Your sweet loving ways just make my day
And that twinkle in your eye's keeping me up at night
Thanks to you know who
But that's enough about me
Let's talk about the way I love your walk
Talk about the way that I love your talk
Did I happen to mention that I love everything you do
That's enough about me
I just can't say enough about your sweet love
I could ramble on and on like a babbling fool
But that's enough about me
Let's talk about the way I love your walk
Talk about the way that I love your talk
Did I happen to mention that I love everything you do
That's enough about me
And all I need is a chance to change your mind
All this distance that's come between us has gone far enough
And now I know that closer to you is where I belong
Who's right or who's wrong
And all I need is a chance to change your mind
This is my kind of town
If this old highway ever gives me up
And I think about settling down
There ain't no place on God's green earth
I'd rather be right now
Folks around here sure seem to know
I could hang around here forever
When it comes time for me to leave
This is my kind of town
If this old highway ever gives me up
And I think about settling down
On someone else's world
But from what I've seen it seems to me
They got lots of extra girls
And if I could find me one of them
And a little house nearby
This is my kind of town
If this old highway ever gives me up
And I think about settling down
If this old highway ever gives me up
And I think about settling down
Each time the good Lord makes a man
He always breaks the mold
So it sure does raise a flag for that
When some phony carbon copy says
I'm the black sheep of the fold
If you trim yourself to fit the world
Just a little here and a little there
Till you won't know yourself
You'll be a pile of shavings
When they put you in your grave
If you trim yourself to fit the world
You'll whittle yourself away
I could change to fit his world
But I just ain't that kind
Some sell their soul for the easy road
The devil's always buying
I can't count the ones I've known
Who fell right into line
Now they walk around with their heads hung down
They've got no piece of mind
If you trim yourself to fit the world
Just a little here and a little there
Till you won't know yourself
You'll be a pile of shavings
When they put you in your grave
If you trim yourself to fit the world
You'll whittle yourself away
So before you sign that dotted line
Or do something that you'd rather not
Before you compromise your stand
Don't let the crowd get so loud
You can't hear your conscience speak
That you sold yourself so cheap
If you trim yourself to fit the world
Just a little here and a little there
Till you won't know yourself
You'll be a pile of shavings
When they put you in your grave
If you trim yourself to fit the world
You'll whittle yourself away
If you trim yourself to fit the world
And it may not look like we got all our share of the promise
If you'll check out my paycheck
I never had to hang my head in shame
Never turned my back on what I believe
Or let my heart be ruled by greed
Now you ain't looking at some dude
That was born with a Silver spoon in his mouth
And damn proud of what I have accomplished
Some folks appreciate that and some don't
And I'll hand out the same sturdy old values of my daddy and my momma
It made me every ounce of what I am and I got it honest
I never had to hang my head in shame
Never turned my back on what I believe
Or let my heart be ruled by greed
Always wanted one to put me to the test
A hot blooded woman that could love a man to death
I got what I wanted but Lord I gotta say
I get up in the morning I'm headed for the door
The last kiss leads to a thousand more
I'm late for work but I can't get away
Finally found a reason to live
But Lord she's gonna kill me as good as she is
But if you've gotta go well it's the only way
Now I wouldn't trade places with any man alive
But man alive it's hard to survive
But I'm gonna keep trying till my dying day
Finally found a reason to live
But Lord she's gonna kill me as good as she is
But if you've gotta go well it's the only way
She said when she found me I was barely hanging on
To the memory of a love that had been long gone
There must have been somebody else I don't remember who it is
When she takes me in her arms I get lost in time
She takes complete control of my heart and my mind
I'm not haunted by the past old memories or regrets
She's taught me that tomorrow is a reason to live
Don't blame and accuse just love and forgive
Now every grudge I ever had no longer exists
When she takes me in her arms I get lost in time
She takes complete control of my heart and my mind
I'm not haunted by the past old memories or regrets
She said when she found me I was barely hanging on
To the memory of a love that had been long gone
There must have been somebody else I don't remember who it is
Sit down honey gotta have us a talk
Your man is a little upset
There's a couple of things that's been missing
I ain't pointing no fingers
And I don't wanna lose my cool
But you just don't fool
With a country boy's tool
Now did I hear you right
To the neighbor down the road
You'd let him have my old bird dog
Or my favorite fishing pole
Now there's one little lesson
That they just don't teach in school
You just don't fool with a country boy's tool
And they may be rusty
And they might be old
But they're kinda like
But there's something else too
That I care about a heck of a lot
Oh you just just don't fool
With a country boy's tool
Now I don't wanna hurt
And I really do understand
That a friend in need
And you offer a helping hand
But if something gets broke
And it's gotta be fixed
Well I don't blame you know who
With a country boy's tool
Thought I saw a new wrinkle
And another strand of gray
Reminding me how time does fly
When I had that first fight
But I still don't give in
When I believe that I'm right
And at least I can stand here
In the man that kid turned out to be
That the cold hands of time
Ain't had much mercy on me
But I played a straight game
With the cards that were dealt
And I can look straight ahead
Now I ain't been no angel
But I learned right from wrong
Yes she taught the rule
That life is lived by
I ain't forgot what you get
Now this old world throws some punches
Now my skin's tough as leather
But I've grown strong with the truth
There's been so many times I could've just stepped aside
Ah but then I couldn't stand here with this peace of mind
That the cold hands of time
Ain't had much mercy on me
But I played a straight game
With the cards that were dealt
And I can look straight ahead
Still look straight ahead
I wanna be loved by you bayou baby
Nobody else but you bayou baby
I searched this world from end to end
Right by you bayou baby
I followed the wind from town to town
Never had a mind of settling down
Falling in love just wasn't my style
But that was before I saw your smile
I wanna be loved by you bayou baby
Nobody else but you bayou baby
I searched this world from end to end
Right by you bayou baby
Gonna make my mark stake my claim
Close as I can to wherever you are
I wanna be loved by you bayou baby
Nobody else but you bayou baby
I searched this world from end to end
Right by you bayou baby
I wanna be loved by you bayou baby
Nobody else but you bayou baby
I searched this world from end to end
Right by you bayou baby
I wanna be loved by you bayou baby
Nobody else but you bayou baby
I searched this world from end to end
Right by you bayou baby
A million reasons why I could
But only one why I won't
Is the reason that I don't
I can't say that I'm not tempted
I'm just like any other man
But when I walk out of here alone woman
I hope you understand
I promised her I'd keep
It'd be so easy for anyone
Fall right into your arms
And say to hell with being strong
But there's one thing I know for sure
She'd never play this kind of game
And for her faith in out love
I promised her I'd keep
There was a brand new stranger at the old bus station
He said Music City is my destination
He said The whole wide world's gonna sing my song
And you can take that to the bank
I'm on a mission from Hank
He got a furnished room and a job at the market
He kept a little notebook in his back pocket
And every time you'd see him he was writing a song
I'm on a mission from Hank
He sang when no one would listen
So he sang until they hung on every word
Ah then one day his phone started ringing
They said we want you and the songs you've been singing
I'm on a mission from Hank
Oh now here's your chance boy go on and take it
You sing from the heart and you're gonna make it
But if anybody tries to change you
I'm on a mission from Hank
Her last lonely teardrop fell
Along about nine o'clock
His memory was history
Before she hit the parking lot
She's got a new attitude yes she's over that dude
And she wants the world to know that
She didn't come in here to hang her head and cry
She's through throwing good love away
On some boy that don't treat her right
She feels like a brand new man tonight
Just like a kid in a candy store
She's checking out the merchandise
But she wants to find the keeping kind
Who will keep her satisfied
And he's gotta be strong gotta be tough
And he's gotta have a tender touch
So if you fit the bill brother don't sit still
She didn't come in here to hang her head and cry
She's through throwing good love away
On some boy that don't treat her right
She feels like a brand new man tonight
She didn't come in here to hang her head and cry
She's through throwing good love away
On some boy that don't treat her right
She feels like a brand new man tonight
Who started a fire in my soul
And to this day it's still burning out of control
With my final breath your name will cross my tongue
You are the woman there'll never be another one
I've stared into the eyes of strangers
Wondering if I'd ever find you girl
The one that I could build my dreams around
To fill my empty world
And now I look at you and know it's true
My search is finally done
This love that I've held on to for so long
Was meant for only one
You are the woman beautiful woman
God only knows just why you chose to love only me
You are the woman oh precious woman
Right her and now I give this vow
There'll never be another one
Right here and now I give this vow
If somebody would've told me
One woman could hold me
And leave me weak as a baby
With a five foot swing
I used to play it so cool
Lord knows that I was no fool
No chains would ever bind me
I never saw love's power
Just the hearts and the flowers
I used to live like a rolling stone
Nobody had a hold on me
All it took was a kiss from you
To bring me right to my knees
Maybe we'll never be seen together
At night on a crowded street
I may never reach across your body
To kill the light when you're asleep
Maybe I'll never watch you dressing
I won't sound too familiar on the phone
But I can touch your hand accidentally
And take that moment home
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
Even though there's nothing else I'd rather do
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
I won't be there when you need holding
But I'm sure that he can pull you through
But I can sing this song to everybody
And pretend it's not about you
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
Even though there's nothing else I'd rather do
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
Even though there's nothing else I'd rather do
That's as close as I'll get to
You say you wish you could stay for another round
Help me close this tavern down
But your better half said you better not be late
Or there's gonna be some hell to pay
Sounds like a real nice problem to have
Well I wish I had someone waiting at home with the lights on
And I wish I had me a reason not to stay out all night long
Sounds to me like a real nice problem to have
Well I've got a pocket full of quarters that I'd love to use
Cause nobody cares when I come and go
I'd trade places with ya buddy in a second flat
Sounds like a real nice problem to have
I was born on the wrong of the city
Desperation in my mother's eyes
Factory whistle would wake me in the morning
At night the sirens sang my lullaby
Fought my way out of the blue collar jungle
Heart of leather and hands of steel
Thought I was too much of a sole survivor
To ever feel the way I feel
But I don't want to live without your love
I don't want to live without your love
I can't take another night
And I've lost the will to fight
I don't want to live without your love
Dance with the Devil in a bottle of whiskey
I paid the fiddler for every song
You'd think with all the lessons learned the hard way
Kept my tears to myself so no one in the world could see
So how's the radio know
How's the radio know she left
How's the radio know I did her wrong
Every record that DJ spins
How's the radio know I miss her
And I'd die to tell her so
He played one about a fool who's choked up with regret
Then one about a woman that a man won't ever forget
How's the radio know she left
How's the radio know I did her wrong
Every record that DJ spins
How's the radio know I miss her
And I'd die to tell her so
Play a song that's filled with sweet apologies
Then crank it up so the signal's loud and strong
How's the radio know she left
How's the radio know I did her wrong
Every record that DJ spins
How's the radio know I miss her
And I'd die to tell her so
I can't shower you with pearls and diamond rings
All I can give are dances in the rain
I can't cover you in satin sheets
But you'll be just as warm
Wrapped up each night inside my loving arms
I can never lay the world down at your feet
The moon and stars will always be beyond my reach
All I have is one true heart that beats
For you and you alone
You can have everything I own
I can promise you a richer life
There's places you may never see
But one thing you can know
I can never lay the world down at your feet
The moon and stars will always be beyond my reach
All I have is one true heart that beats
For you and you alone
You can have everything I own
All I have is one true heart that beats
For you and you alone
You can have everything I own
But a woman like you baby should never have the blues
When I go to sleep at night you're always a part of my dreams
When I go to sleep at night you're always a part of my dreams
Ever since that night you walked out
I've barely had the strength
But a man can't hide away forever
And last night I finally told me so
I knew I had to get out
But I knew I had to take it slow
So I burned down this town
A honky tonk at a time
I got loud and checked out
Every cute little cowgirl I could hold
Getting over you is still a long ways away
Last night was one small step
But you gotta start somewhere
Think I feel a little better
A little more like the man I used to be
I ain't saying that I'm there yet
But I can see some possibilities
When your motor ain't been fired up lately
You can't just jam it in gear and go
I know I'm still not up to speed
Now once I stood like a mountain high
Cold and rough and no sign of life
Didn't need no one didn't want no love
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
What the whole world couldn't change
She polished up the good
And she chipped away the wrong
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
With a willing heart and patient hands
She poured her love on a hopeless man
And now they stare in disbelieve
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
What the whole world couldn't change
She polished up the good
And then she chipped away the wrong
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
Now I ain't perfect by any means
But I suit her and that suits me
And I'll be her rock till I turn to dust
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
What the whole world couldn't change
She polished up the good
And then she chipped away the wrong
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
You say you finally found your Mr. Right
He's got you flying like a dime store kite
Well I'll be waiting here on the ground
Look me up if he lets you down
You've always got me to fall back on
It might help to know you've got a Plan B
Whatever else happens you've always got me
I gave you my heart and my heart is true
You're gonna have to carry it permanently
Another horse in the barn
Another map to your treasure
A little bit for good measure
It might help you to know you've got a Plan B
Sit down honey gotta have us a talk
Your man is a little upset
There's a couple of things that's been missing
I ain't pointing no fingers
And I don't wanna lose my cool
But you just don't fool
With a country boy's tool
Now did I hear you right
To the neighbor down the road
You'd let him have my old bird dog
Or my favorite fishing pole
Now there's one little lesson
That they just don't teach in school
You just don't fool with a country boy's tool
And they may be rusty
And they might be old
But they're kinda like
But there's something else too
That I care about a heck of a lot
Oh you just just don't fool
With a country boy's tool
Now I don't wanna hurt
And I really do understand
That a friend in need
And you offer a helping hand
But if something gets broke
And it's gotta be fixed
Well I don't blame you know who
With a country boy's tool
She left me here without any warning
On a cold gray Kentucky morning
I need a cup of coffee with a shot of cream
Wake me from this awful dream
When I went to sleep she was by my side
And I didn't know she wasn't satisfied
Well she left me here without any warning
On a cold gray Kentucky morning
Now I'm waking up without my darling
Now the Ohio is wide and deep
And I'm walking beside it in my sleep
And I'm thinking about drowning my sorrow
She left me here without any warning
On a cold gray Kentucky morning
Now I'm waking up without my darling
Everyone that knew him knew which side that he'd be on
For what he thought was right
You've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name
But we always had plenty just living his advice
And I know that things are different than they were in Daddy's day
But I still believe what makes a man really hasn't changed
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
More than once she's left me on the side of the road
She's riding me around on four bald tires
The wipers don't work and the horn don't blow
She ain't a Cadillac and she ain't a Rolls
I got stopped by a cop late last night
I asked her last time that I took her out
She ain't a Cadillac and she ain't a Rolls
I've walked the straight and narrow and I've worn a rebel's brand
And I wouldn't have it any other way
I wouldn't have it any other way
I could have taken a beaten path every time trouble starts
And I wouldn't have it any other way
I wouldn't have it any other way
We've got a problem we can't get around
It's gotten too big to just tear down
We built a wall out of thin air
Now I'm over here and you're over there
I'm afraid that there's no two ways to it
This wall could be our undoing
Only thing left is to build a door
A door ain't nothing but a way to get through a wall
A window won't work and a ladder stretched that tall
You get a hammer and I'll get a saw
What we need between you and me is a door
A couple of splinters would be well worth it
And then we'll shake hands on a job well done
Once that door's standing open
We'll get some communication going
A door ain't nothing but a way to get through a wall
A window won't work and a ladder stretched that tall
You get a hammer and I'll get a saw
What we need between you and me is a door
A door ain't nothing but a way to get through a wall
You get a hammer and I'll get a saw
Somewhere out there in the smoky air
Where the night is neon blue
One drink could lead her to
I can't be far behind her
Before my angel is gone
Looking for my blue angel
The same one that flew from my arms last night
If you see my blue angel
Tell her that heaven without her feels like hell tonight
Last night when she left I told myself
That she wouldn't go too far
Now I'm not so sure how long her tears
Could last in a stranger's arms
She's wounded I know and feeling so low
She could fall at anytime
I don't know what I'd do if I were to lose
That precious angel of mine
Looking for my blue angel
The same one that flew from my arms last night
If you see my blue angel
Tell her that heaven without her feels like hell tonight
But you've gotta get it started if you wanna get it done
You set your mind and roll up your sleeves
With your heart in your hands and the sweat on your brow
You build the things that really make the world go around
You bet your bottom dollar it was made right here
Now there ain't no shame in a job well done
From driving a nail to driving a truck
As a matter of fact I'd like to set things straight
If you wanna cram course in reality
There ain't no trophies or cheering crowds
You'll face yourself at the end of the day
And be damn proud of whatever you've made
Can't hang it on the wall for the world to see
Now there ain't no shame in a job well done
From driving a nail to driving a truck
As a matter of fact I'd like to set things straight
If you wanna cram course in reality
She's been staring out the window four nights in a row
And she just can't resist when she feels the pull
She's got a restless spirit that she can't control
She hears the call of the wild every once in a while
She can turn it loose and howl
When she winks at me and smiles
Love making state of mind
Just more of a woman at times like this
And Lord knows I got my hands full tonight
She hears the call of the wild every once in a while
She can turn it loose and howl
When she winks at me and smiles
Love making state of mind
To music only you and I can hear
That's what happens when I hold you
That's what happens when I hold you
I lose my breath and I can't speak
I never tasted love this sweet
And every time it feels brand new
That's what happens when I hold you
That's what happens when I hold you
That's what happens when I hold you
That's what happens when I hold you
I lose my breath and I can't speak
I never tasted love this sweet
And every time it feels brand new
That's what happens when I hold you
That's what happens when I hold
And all I need is a chance to change your mind
All this distance that's come between us has gone far enough
And now I know that closer to you is where I belong
Who's right or who's wrong
And all I need is a chance to change your mind
And it may not look like we got all our share of the promise
If you'll check out my paycheck
I never had to hang my head in shame
Never turned my back on what I believe
Or let my heart be ruled by greed
Now you ain't looking at some dude
That was born with a Silver spoon in his mouth
And damn proud of what I have accomplished
Some folks appreciate that and some don't
And I'll hand out the same sturdy old values of my daddy and my momma
It made me every ounce of what I am and I got it honest
I never had to hang my head in shame
Never turned my back on what I believe
Or let my heart be ruled by greed
Maybe we'll never be seen together
At night on a crowded street
I may never reach across your body
To kill the light when you're asleep
Maybe I'll never watch you dressing
I won't sound too familiar on the phone
But I can touch your hand accidentally
And take that moment home
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
Even though there's nothing else I'd rather do
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
I won't be there when you need holding
But I'm sure that he can pull you through
But I can sing this song to everybody
And pretend it's not about you
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
Even though there's nothing else I'd rather do
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
Even though there's nothing else I'd rather do
That's as close as I'll get to
But it'll hurt me so much
You don't want me to know
You've done all you can
But one part of you let your feelings show
Say you won't go away
Make me think you're still mine
Oh girl if only your eyes could lie
So I say what's wrong
And you say its nothing
I can almost believe it
When I hold you like this
But I know in my heart
That there's no tomorrow
I'll pretend that there it
Say you won't go away
Make me think you're still mine
Oh girl if only your eyes could lie
I'd start it over from scratch
And then I'd strike the match
Yeah we'd go back to the basics
Of how things ought to be
If it was left up to me
Is a little more steel guitar
And put a little fiddle right in the middle
From sea to shining sea
Be proud of it and always love it
That's what this country needs
Just twist that radio dial
What life is all about
They laugh and they smile and they hurt
And that's my humble opinion y'all
You can take it for what it's worth
Is a little more steel guitar
And put a little fiddle right in the middle
From sea to shining sea
Be proud of it and always love it
That's what this country needs
Across the land of the free
Is a little more steel guitar
And put a little fiddle right in the middle
From sea to shining sea
Be proud of it and always love it
That's what this country needs
You just be proud of it and always love it
It's not my style to dance away the night
Or go for a walk beneath the full moonlight
And I don't wish on falling stars
Or easily give away my heart
Can't hide this love that I feel
Never been the kind of guy
To fall in head over heels
It's not like me at all to talk about
The likelihood of finally settling down
Can't hide this love that I feel
Never been the kind of guy
To fall in head over heels
I've never been the kind of guy
To fall in head over heals
When I can't find the will
When all my dreams are standing still
How did I get this far
What is the bottom line each and every time
Every thought I think
Every breath I breath
Everything that I hold dear to me
Revolves around one simple little word
There's times I take it all for granted
Just how fortunate I am
God knows it took a better woman to make me a better man
Don't always let her know
What I couldn't live without
I know there ain't a doubt
And for all it's worth
I made five hundred miles in six hours flat trying to make up for lost time
Between the hands of fate and a lot of hard luck
This ain't been no gravy train
And I didn't come this far just to walk away
I slung a rod just east of Memphis and that heap of a truck shut down
So for nine cold hours I thumbed my way
Straight to the guitar town
And the last twelve miles to your mama's house
I hiked through the pouring rain
And I didn't come this far just to walk away
I could have turned around a thousand times and went back to where I'm from
But I'd go an extra million miles if I could save what's left of us
It was a burning love that drove me here and girl I hope and pray
That I didn't come this far just to walk away
I know that this front door ain't the only thing that stands between you and me
But I'm gonna prove my love to you no matter what it takes
Oh I could have turned around a thousand times and went back to where I'm from
But I'd go an extra million miles if I could save what's left of us
Oh It was a burning love that drove me here and girl I hope and pray
That I didn't come this far just to walk away
As we passed in the hall
She said we need to talk
I can't go on like this another day
And a chill ran up my back
She said there's someone else
And I've kept it to myself
But I can't keep these feelings locked inside
I need to tell you this
It's one of your old friends
One you haven't talked to in a while
And there's nothing you can do
I said I had a feeling you found somebody new
And I'll bet I can guess his name
But it's so hard to believe
It's someone you don't know
I'm leaving you for me
I just stood there at a loss for words
And there's nothing you can do
I said I had a feeling that you found somebody new
And I'll bet I can guess his name
But it's so hard to believe
Oh she said you're not even close
It's someone you don't know
I'm leaving you for me
She said you're not even close
It's someone you don't know
Of all the things I've ever done
I'd be hard pressed to think of one
That makes me feel the way you do
Nothing compares to loving you
Of all the things I've yet to try
There ain't one thing that comes to mind
My running wild days are through
Nothing compares to loving you
I don't need a mountain
I don't need the challenge
I don't need a river to cross
That turns me on the way you do
Nothing compares to loving you
And one day when I face the Lord
Heaven won't be my reward
Until you're up there with me too
Nothing compares to loving you
I don't need a mountain
I don't need the challenge
I don't need a river to cross
That turns me on the way you do
Nothing compares to loving you
Nothing compares to loving you
That I want more than your sweet love
I don't need a mountain
I don't need the challenge
I don't need a river to cross
That turns me on the way you do
Nothing compares to loving you
Nothing compares to loving you
Nothing compares to loving you
Girl I know that I promised you
I can make your every dream come true
But I admit I got a little ways to go
Don't quit now we got a foot in the door
Say you're not about to end the party
I stand behind every word I say
I can't believe you wanna throw in the towel
Don't quit now we got a foot in the door
Say you're not about to end the party
Like an old violin or vintage wine
All good things come in good time
We might run out of road
Honey I swear up and down
We'll have it all in the long haul
Don't quit now we got a foot in the door
Say you're not about to end the party
Don't quit now we got a foot in the door
Say you're not about to end the party
Don't quit now we got a foot in the door
Say you're not about to end the party
This street that we live on
Ain't no yellow brick road
Sure ain't no pot of gold
When people dream they don't wish they were up
They don't know we got more then enough
Somewhere under the rainbow
Somewhere under the rainbow
And go back through life's pages
And correct a lot of things
Back when I knew everything
Is what I thought made the man
But now life's hard knocks is about all
Back when I knew everything
One more chance is all I need
Now all that I can say
Back when I knew everything
But life's a whittled me down to size
I just hope there's enough of me left
She's as gentle as a July breeze
I was empty as a man could be
Until the day I found her
Times I find it hard to put into words
The Way I feel when I'm away from her
I'm like a man about to die of thirst
When I'm not around her
It's in the passion of her soft caress
It's in the power of her tenderness
She can move me with her fingertips
And with a whisper she can soother me
She electrifies my heart and soul
With an energy invisible
It's so much more than purely physical
You're the only reason for me
Diamonds and gold treasures untold once beheld this heart of mine
Riches of the earth carry no worth if the soul's left unsatisfied
You're the only reason for me
Everyone that knew him knew which side that he'd be on
For what he thought was right
You've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name
But we always had plenty just living his advice
And I know that things are different than they were in Daddy's day
But I still believe what makes a man really hasn't changed
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
It's taken me some time to read the writing on the wall
But I have finally figured out just what's been going on
And I need to tell you what I've learned before you turn to go
There's things about that other man I think you should know
The man that came between us was looking out for number one
He didn't care how bad he hurt you by the selfish things he'd done
That man that came between us was me
I know I'm sorry don't make up for half the tears you've cried
And I can't promise miracles but I swear to God I'll try
And that stranger's gone for good
The man that came between us was looking out for number one
He didn't care how bad he hurt you by the selfish things he'd done
That man that came between us was me
And I ain't gonna stop until I forget it all
All my tin can buddies that help me ease the pain
One by one they remind me she's not coming back again
Just how long she's been gone I can't say I really know
I don't need a watch or a clock on the wall
To tell me just how long it took for me to lose it all
One by one they remind me she's not coming back again
Just how long she's been gone I can't say I really know
If you're lost and you're alone
Let me sing you a song
I can sympathize with you
I was born with a broken heart
Born to lose right from the start
That's why I sing the way I do
A sad six string and a jukebox voice
I'm the lonely people's choice
I was made to play the part
I was born with a broken heart
If the sun should ever shine in your life
And may you leave behind these old troubled times that we've shared
I'm where I'm supposed to be
And anywhere there's a lonely street I'll be there
I was born with a broken heart
Born to lose right from the start
That's why I sing the way I do
A sad six string and a jukebox voice
I'm the lonely people's choice
I was made to play the part
I was born with a broken heart
She's been staring out the window four nights in a row
And she just can't resist when she feels the pull
She's got a restless spirit that she can't control
She hears the call of the wild every once in a while
She can turn it loose and howl
When she winks at me and smiles
Love making state of mind
Just more of a woman at times like this
And Lord knows I got my hands full tonight
She hears the call of the wild every once in a while
She can turn it loose and howl
When she winks at me and smiles
Love making state of mind
Her last lonely teardrop fell
Along about nine o'clock
His memory was history
Before she hit the parking lot
She's got a new attitude yes she's over that dude
And she wants the world to know that
She didn't come in here to hang her head and cry
She's through throwing good love away
On some boy that don't treat her right
She feels like a brand new man tonight
Just like a kid in a candy store
She's checking out the merchandise
But she wants to find the keeping kind
Who will keep her satisfied
And he's gotta be strong gotta be tough
And he's gotta have a tender touch
So if you fit the bill brother don't sit still
She didn't come in here to hang her head and cry
She's through throwing good love away
On some boy that don't treat her right
She feels like a brand new man tonight
She didn't come in here to hang her head and cry
She's through throwing good love away
On some boy that don't treat her right
She feels like a brand new man tonight
There was a brand new stranger at the old bus station
He said Music City is my destination
He said The whole wide world's gonna sing my song
And you can take that to the bank
I'm on a mission from Hank
He got a furnished room and a job at the market
He kept a little notebook in his back pocket
And every time you'd see him he was writing a song
I'm on a mission from Hank
He sang when no one would listen
So he sang until they hung on every word
Ah then one day his phone started ringing
They said we want you and the songs you've been singing
I'm on a mission from Hank
Oh now here's your chance boy go on and take it
You sing from the heart and you're gonna make it
But if anybody tries to change you
I'm on a mission from Hank
Who started a fire in my soul
And to this day it's still burning out of control
With my final breath your name will cross my tongue
You are the woman there'll never be another one
I've stared into the eyes of strangers
Wondering if I'd ever find you girl
The one that I could build my dreams around
To fill my empty world
And now I look at you and know it's true
My search is finally done
This love that I've held on to for so long
Was meant for only one
You are the woman beautiful woman
God only knows just why you chose to love only me
You are the woman oh precious woman
Right her and now I give this vow
There'll never be another one
Right here and now I give this vow
Every time your memory fills my mind
To a young girl and a reckless young man
I've learned to say I'm sorry
And admit when I've been wrong
Just too bad I couldn't have learned that
Lot of lonely years ago
What I did and didn't do
One thing will still be true
Every time your memory fills my mind
To a young girl and a reckless young man
Sit down honey gotta have us a talk
Your man is a little upset
There's a couple of things that's been missing
I ain't pointing no fingers
And I don't wanna lose my cool
But you just don't fool
With a country boy's tool
Now did I hear you right
To the neighbor down the road
You'd let him have my old bird dog
Or my favorite fishing pole
Now there's one little lesson
That they just don't teach in school
You just don't fool with a country boy's tool
And they may be rusty
And they might be old
But they're kinda like
But there's something else too
That I care about a heck of a lot
Oh you just just don't fool
With a country boy's tool
Now I don't wanna hurt
And I really do understand
That a friend in need
And you offer a helping hand
But if something gets broke
And it's gotta be fixed
Well I don't blame you know who
With a country boy's tool
Maybe we'll never be seen together
At night on a crowded street
I may never reach across your body
To kill the light when you're asleep
Maybe I'll never watch you dressing
I won't sound too familiar on the phone
But I can touch your hand accidentally
And take that moment home
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
Even though there's nothing else I'd rather do
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
I won't be there when you need holding
But I'm sure that he can pull you through
But I can sing this song to everybody
And pretend it's not about you
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
Even though there's nothing else I'd rather do
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
Even though there's nothing else I'd rather do
That's as close as I'll get to
Kept my tears to myself so no one in the world could see
So how's the radio know
How's the radio know she left
How's the radio know I did her wrong
Every record that DJ spins
How's the radio know I miss her
And I'd die to tell her so
He played one about a fool who's choked up with regret
Then one about a woman that a man won't ever forget
How's the radio know she left
How's the radio know I did her wrong
Every record that DJ spins
How's the radio know I miss her
And I'd die to tell her so
Play a song that's filled with sweet apologies
Then crank it up so the signal's loud and strong
How's the radio know she left
How's the radio know I did her wrong
Every record that DJ spins
How's the radio know I miss her
And I'd die to tell her so
But a woman like you baby should never have the blues
When I go to sleep at night you're always a part of my dreams
When I go to sleep at night you're always a part of my dreams
She was a woman on a mission
Here to drown him and forget him
So I set her up again to wash him down
She had just about succeeded
He never missed a lick
When she stood up and said
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips
And there's only one thing left for you to do
You just come on over here one last time
Pucker up and close your eyes
And kiss this goodbye
She had him back against the wall
Chewing him like a bulldog on a bone
She was putting him in his place
And I mean right up in his face
They've come to watch him pay for his every sin
She called him everything under the sun
And when we thought that she was done
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips
And there's only one thing left for you to do
You just come on over here one last time
Pucker up and close your eyes
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips
And there's only one thing left for you to do
You just come on over here one last time
Pucker up and close your eyes
And kiss this goodbye
That alarm sounds without warning
I wake up and say good morning and I love you
And though sometimes you're still sleeping
This ain't some kind of sometimes thing
This is something I will always do
While I work I curse the boss
Oh and there's a little place
Where everybody goes at five o'clock
Me holding you and you holding me
Three plays for a quarter and they still
And that double yellow line
And it's all because of people like us
There's greasy little truck stops and all night dives
No tell motels and everybody knows why
And it's all because of people like us
And it's all because of people like us
I look at you and I remember
The way I felt on the day we met
That same old feeling washes over me
Nothing has ever changed for me babe
Nothing changes for you
I still want you just as much as I did
I'm still wrapped up in the ring around
I'm telling you the truth
I'm still as much in love with you as I
I'm a slave to your every desire
I worship the ground where you walk
I'm telling you the truth
I'm still as much in love with you as I
You still stir up that old desire
I can feel it now as we speak
Prepared me for a love this deep
In my heart and in my soul
By two brown eyes and a band of gold
I'm still as much in love with you as I
I've always lived on the edge of life
I don't fear the dark of night
I may be crazy but I'm not a fool
I'd be afraid of losing you
I've looked danger in the eye
I'm not afraid to live or die
But after all that I've been through
I'd be afraid of losing you
I couldn't face a single day
Without you in my life
Your sweet embrace is all it takes
I've always been a restless soul
Hungered for the winding road
But a rebel heart still knows the truth
I'd be afraid of losing you
I couldn't face a single day
Without you in my life
Your sweet embrace is all it takes
I've always lived on the edge of life
I don't fear the dark of night
I may be crazy but I'm not a fool
I'd be afraid of losing you
I'd be afraid of losing you
I may be crazy but I'm not a fool
A couple of bucks worth of change
A half a tank of Texaco
You're sitting with your feet on the dash
Fiddling with the radio
Out where the roads ain't paved
It doesn't matter anyway
Head over heart and soul
As long as your arms are around me
It Don't matter where we go
I'm right where I always dreamed that
Lost since you found me
We can go to the Oklahoma
Take a swim if it gets too hot
I never noticed that little white house
And I've been up and down this road about
Ever since you came in sight
I don't know my left from right
Where I start or where you end
Lost since you found me
I've been lost since you found me
I'd hook my wagon to my trike and I'd
To my big sandbox where I worked real hard
Playing all day with my little toy trucks
That was my whole life when I was a kid
Running up the road or crawling across the
The mud on my boots and the grease on my
I try to explain how it makes me feel
The awesome power of my hands on the
If I can't find the words to set things right
Gasoline and diesel fuel a running through
And still willing to love
If there's a man enough to be her man
But right now her hands are full
Fighting back the tears and the wolves
But she keeps smiling just as hard as she can
They're all counting on mama
And she ain't about to let them down
The world on you shoulders
Just didn't have the guts
To be a lover or father or much of a man
So she put him in his place
Out in the road with his suitcase in his hand
It's the kitchen and it's the mop
That we all ought to be ashamed
If our biggest trouble is just turning old and
Once in awhile my mind takes a trip
Down memory lane where two fool kids
First found love in my old Tempest
Ribbons in your hair and white cotton dress
We lost our fear and our innocence
Every now and then on a night like this
Every now and then when the moon's just right
Those old feelings come back to life
And I wish I could turn back time somehow
We parked down along Dry Creek Road
We were green but it never showed
You could have lit a fire with the flame in our eyes
We left nothing to be desired
We gave it all that we got
And turn up those old feelings
And I wish I could turn back time somehow
To tell you what's on my mind
I don't know exactly how to say it
But I do think that it's about time
I do know that you've been working all day
And I know that you could use the rest
But I've got a little proposition for you baby
No tell me what you think about this
Let's do the night shift baby
I mean all night long
Do what comes naturally
We'll toss and turn and roll and shout
And love every minute we can
I hear they got a pretty good band
If we still ain't ready to quit
Who knows we might even give a brand new
To doing the night shift
The first time we went all the way
I can truly say it was way beyond my
And I never can forget the day
We spent tangled up in satin sheets
And I never thought we'd top the time that
Even though that was incredible not I know
The best was yet to be
The best love we ever made
And it's still growing every day
Right before our very eyes
And we're so amazed we could create
Such a priceless work of art
Is this precious child of ours
The first time our baby cried
I knew our lives were never gonna be the
Opened up a new kind of love I can't explain
Now all this time I thought
That I was living life for you and me alone
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
Jingle around the clock
That's the jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
Jingle around the clock
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
There in your Christmas of white
Candy canes and popcorn strings and lights all up on the tree presents underneath the tree wrapped for you and me Christmas is the warmest time of year.
It was almost Christmas and I was all alone
What was on my mind when I didn't say
He said that He was Jesus born in Bethlehem
And that He died for us but somehow we'd forgotten Him
Maybe He was lying just above my father's tree
But He said that He was Jesus and I just had to believe
I sat there in stunned silence and when His eyes met mine
And I admit I had my doubts but I just couldn't take the chance
And He said that He was Jesus born in Bethlehem
And that He died for us but somehow we'd forgotten Him
Maybe He was lying just above my father's tree
But He said that He was Jesus and I just had to believe
I may never know if it was Jesus in that chair
All I really know is that I'm sure that He was there
He said that He was Jesus born in Bethlehem
And that He died for us but somehow we'd forgotten Him
Maybe He was lying just above my father's tree
But He said that He was Jesus and I just had to believe
We're gonna wish we hadn't
But we all come over anyway
And it's nice to see the family
We know there ain't no escape
And you better stay out of her way
And they gotta go up today
She's gonna have a job for you
So you better get ready too
Now she's the queen of redneck Christmas
At least that's what my daddy thinks
That laughs and waves and blinks
Last year my brother Bill almost got killed
And when I get done with these stupid plastic reindeer
That's the last that woman's gonna see of me
And you better stay out of her way
And they gotta go up today
She's gonna have a job for you
So you better get ready too
And folks will come from near and far
Christmas is about to start
And you better stay out of her way
And they gotta go up today
She's gonna have a job for you
So you better get ready too
I'll search and find that special tree
One that looks just right
Then I'll decorate it perfectly
Even if it takes all night
Then I'll light the fire
Turn the lights down low
And hang up the mistletoe
And make some lasting memories
A December to remember
Spending everyday of the holidays
Wrapped up in each others arms
All I want for Christmas
Is forever to be like this
A December to remember forever more
Don't spend a single cent
On a Christmas gift for me
Cause the thing that I want most of all
Can't be found beneath the tree
It's the loving look that's in your eyes
That money could never buy
And I what I give you in return
Will last throughout the years
A December to remember
Spending everyday of the holidays
Wrapped up in each others arms
All I want for Christmas
Is forever to be like this
A December to remember forever more
And all I want for Christmas
Is forever to be like this
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glory streams from heaven afar
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Here's what I tell everyone
I was born by God's dear grace
In an extraordinary place
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly
Happiness ain't out of reach
Hard work pays off the way it should
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly
There's a lady that stands in a harbor for what we believe
And there's a bell that still echoes the price that it cost to be free
I pledge allegiance to this flag
But if you got pride and you're proud you do
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly
And there's a bell that still echoes the price that it cost to be free
But it's the only place that I prefer
To love my wife and raise my kids
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly
Have I got the deal for you
Served on the finest china
Accompanied by a bottle of the world's greatest wine
Served in a crystal glass
Or would you rather have
Underneath a big oak tree
Snuggled up with the one you love.
I'll talk love over money
Some people work work work their lives away
But I'll take love over money
You're on the streets of Paris
Surrounded by all the magical things the City of Romance has to offer
But you're all alone.
Or would you rather be at the state fair
Drinking a Dr. Pepper
And stealing a kiss from the one you love.
Okay now think about this
Price tag 205 and some change
But no one and I mean absolutely no one will ever be in the passenger seat with you
Or would you rather have a 1989
Mud gray 150 extended cab with 4 wheel drive
In a tiny town where the biggest things
Were the water tower and a young boy's
In a little house of simple means
Where doing without was a common
On a dried up square of worthless Earth
Where we scratched our living out of
In a little brown church where I first
The choir sing and the preacher's word
And the closer that I looked within
The further I could see
And I really didn't have much other
Where a man dies young if he don't think
On the streets where the truth is hard
And what's in it for me is the bottom line
They turn their backs like you're not
I held my breath and bit my tongue
In a power stronger than you or me
Now when they put that granite on my
All I want that stone to say is
And where I'm from and the woman I love
The job I did and God Above
I reckon there's one near your hometown
Just hang a left down the lost highway
Keep going till you see the signs that say
Honky tonk if you love country
Honky tonk you whole life long
Honky tonk if you love country
That's what keeps this country strong
Them little ladies in the kitchen can't be
Your pickled pig feet
Don't you try to order no imported beer
That truck only runs from St. Louie to
All the girls get frisky on Friday night
When the band starts playing don't you
We do things different when we start to
We'll be the life of the party at the party
Ain't no better place for you to be
In the home of the brave and the land of
She's got a dress full of dangerous stuff.
But the way she loves me nearly stops my heart.
She gives it good and I can't get enough.
Right now gonna take you in my arms
Hold you closer and tighter than I ever have
I'm gonna say all the things that I thought could wait
Now I realize that later could be a little too late
Baby let's love like there's no tomorrow
Live for every moment
If we see the sun rise in the morning
So let's love like there's no tomorrow
From now on on every time we kiss
So much more when I touch your lips
When I give myself to you
To make every minute last
Baby let's love like there's no tomorrow
Live for every moment
If we see the sun rise in the morning
So let's love like there's no tomorrow
Jack handed Rita his paycheck
He said they're cutting back at work
They had to let me go
And Jack expected tears
But he didn't expect these words
As Rita pulled him close
At the end of the day
Is really where it all begins
And who's your friends
All that really counts is how you sleep
At the end of the day
But it sure ain't love
I thought I had to have all this
Twenty cold rooms full of stuff
At the end of the day
Is really where it all begins
And who's your friends
All that really counts is how you sleep
At the end of the day
Now when my grandpa died
He didn't have a dime
And when it came time to see him off
The whole damn county came
And I remember he used to say it all the time
At the end of the day
Is really where it all begins
All that really counts is how you sleep
At the end of the day
We could fly on the wings of an eagle
Take a ride on a rocket ship
Drink to the bottom of a bottle
But we can't get any higher than this
We could tiptoe up to the mountaintop
Snuggle and cuddle and a kiss
But sooner or later we gotta come down
And we can't get any higher than this
If the sky is the limit
There's no telling how far we'll go
Even the angels are grinning
If there's a heaven we're right in the
If this ain't stoned on loving
Cloud nine is right below us
And we can't get any higher than this
When an old cowboy came through the
He took a few shaky steps
Then he started to moan
And he keeled over right on the floor
He listened and he looked in his eyes
I just might need your help
Lodged in this poor boy's heart
By the look in his eyes he ain't cried in
Doc wrote a prescription to induce him
It was whiskey and sad country songs
We propped him up in a booth
And poured a drink down his throat
Well he spluttered and he coughed
And he hung down his head
As those lonely songs worked on his
When the memories started coming six
Slowly welled up in his eyes
When he cried that five gallon tear
That jar by the door don't hold pig feet
The contents are sparkling clear
That liquid within is not moonshine or
It's a reminder to everyone here
Let this be a lesson to you
Keep your sorrow inside for too many
And you'll cry that five gallon tear
You'll cry a five gallon tear
That folds out into a bed
But it ain't too bad if you lay on your
And use the armrest for you head
And the stuffing is sticking out
But it's times like these she ain't happy
I thank God for this old couch
As I've ever seen her be
And this pillow and blanket and a mighty
Tells me where I'm gonna sleep
I learned a long time ago don't say
And soon she'll simmer down
And with a little bit of luck we'll kiss
Sitting right here on this old couch
While she blows off a little steam
Well she's mad as hell but that's
She ain't getting rid of me
That's what love's about
And we both know I'll never go no
It really all depends
On how long it takes for the begging and
To finally start soaking in
Not to stick my big foot in my big mouth
I won't have to spend so much time along
I can see it all plain as day
You can make a dream come true just
All you gotta do is love me back
All you gotta do is love me back
And I'll hand you the world on a string
I'll throw in the moon and the stars
And for that I'll only ask one thing
And to tell you the truth that's exactly
I can't afford to waste no time
I've got forever on my mind
You've already got my heart and
Now all you gotta do is love me back
Fate's already set the wheels in motion
And I'll show you everlasting true
Ready to rock in a country kinda way
And the blow of that first kiss
I swear it almost knocked me to my knee
Caught my heart off guard
For the first time in my life I felt too weak
And I could not stop my stop my self from loving you
It's a feeling if I fought I know I'd lose
I could never let it go
I could never walk away
It would tear me in two
Even if I tried I could not stop myself from loving you
Oh I never had a chance
I feel and I was never coming back
Your love was just to strong
I knew that I had finally met my match
And I could not stop my stop myself from loving you
It's a feeling if I fought I know I'd lose
I could never let it go
I could never walk away
It would tear me in two
Even if I tried I could not stop myself from loving you
Oh I could not stop myself from loving you
It's a feeling if I fought I know I'd lose
Oh I could never let it go
I could never walk away
Even if I tried I could not stop myself from loving you
And weights what broke the wagon
There ain't no fence between right or wrong
Sometimes you gotta fight if you wanna get along
You better stand up when that flag gets raised
Or down on your knees when it's time to pray
But the greatest thing about him to me
Was the fact that he believed
He believed in the good Lord above
He believed in why the blood was shed
And if he couldn't be free he'd rather be dead
And to never give up on your dreams
But most of all yeah most of all he believed in me
Well he had his own opinion
About the world and its condition
Spare the rod spoil the child
You'll reap what you sow if you let it grow wild
You just gotta deal with the hand you're dealt
Never give up and you'll never really fail
But the greatest thing about dad to me
Was the fact that he believed
Oh and just because of him I know who I am today
And all I need is a chance to change your mind
All this distance that's come between us has gone far enough
And now I know that closer to you is where I belong
Who's right or who's wrong
And all I need is a chance to change your mind
But you've gotta get it started if you wanna get it done
You set your mind and roll up your sleeves
With your heart in your hands and the sweat on your brow
You build the things that really make the world go around
You bet your bottom dollar it was made right here
Now there ain't no shame in a job well done
From driving a nail to driving a truck
As a matter of fact I'd like to set things straight
If you wanna cram course in reality
There ain't no trophies or cheering crowds
You'll face yourself at the end of the day
And be damn proud of whatever you've made
Can't hang it on the wall for the world to see
Now there ain't no shame in a job well done
From driving a nail to driving a truck
As a matter of fact I'd like to set things straight
If you wanna cram course in reality
She's been staring out the window four nights in a row
And she just can't resist when she feels the pull
She's got a restless spirit that she can't control
She hears the call of the wild every once in a while
She can turn it loose and howl
When she winks at me and smiles
Love making state of mind
Just more of a woman at times like this
And Lord knows I got my hands full tonight
She hears the call of the wild every once in a while
She can turn it loose and howl
When she winks at me and smiles
Love making state of mind
More than once she's left me on the side of the road
She's riding me around on four bald tires
The wipers don't work and the horn don't blow
She ain't a Cadillac and she ain't a Rolls
I got stopped by a cop late last night
I asked her last time that I took her out
She ain't a Cadillac and she ain't a Rolls
Maybe we'll never be seen together
At night on a crowded street
I may never reach across your body
To kill the light when you're asleep
Maybe I'll never watch you dressing
I won't sound too familiar on the phone
But I can touch your hand accidentally
And take that moment home
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
Even though there's nothing else I'd rather do
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
I won't be there when you need holding
But I'm sure that he can pull you through
But I can sing this song to everybody
And pretend it's not about you
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
Even though there's nothing else I'd rather do
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
Even though there's nothing else I'd rather do
That's as close as I'll get to
And it may not look like we got all our share of the promise
If you'll check out my paycheck
I never had to hang my head in shame
Never turned my back on what I believe
Or let my heart be ruled by greed
Now you ain't looking at some dude
That was born with a Silver spoon in his mouth
And damn proud of what I have accomplished
Some folks appreciate that and some don't
And I'll hand out the same sturdy old values of my daddy and my momma
It made me every ounce of what I am and I got it honest
I never had to hang my head in shame
Never turned my back on what I believe
Or let my heart be ruled by greed
I've walked the straight and narrow and I've worn a rebel's brand
And I wouldn't have it any other way
I wouldn't have it any other way
I could have taken a beaten path every time trouble starts
And I wouldn't have it any other way
I wouldn't have it any other way
I parked my car beside the highway and I didn't lock the doors
And this road that's going nowhere just leads me on and on
As I ask myself with every step will I ever be alone
I wonder just how far it is over you
Is there no place I go that you don't come too
Now I wonder how far it is over you
I was deep in California when I finally made a friend
And it was me and that old hobo till you showed up again
Then he ran out of liquor and I've run out of time
And I'm staring at the water so blue and deep and wide
Bet a man could lose a memory over on the other side
I wonder just how far it is over you
Is there no place I go that you don't come too
Now I wonder how far it is over you
I parked my car beside the highway and I didn't lock the doors
I'm a mild mannered man who pulls his weight
Then I disappear until the weekend's through
And you'll never guess who I turn into
Dancing on the tables
And swinging from the chandeliers
That's who I really am
Everybody's waiting for my next move
Last night I broke the record for acting a fool
My favorite waitress said I went a little too far
When I came roller skating down the top of the bar
The never should have bet me that it couldn't be done
Dancing on the tables
And swinging from the chandeliers
That's who I really am
Dancing on the tables
And swinging from the chandeliers
Somewhere out there in the smoky air
Where the night is neon blue
One drink could lead her to
I can't be far behind her
Before my angel is gone
Looking for my blue angel
The same one that flew from my arms last night
If you see my blue angel
Tell her that heaven without her feels like hell tonight
Last night when she left I told myself
That she wouldn't go too far
Now I'm not so sure how long her tears
Could last in a stranger's arms
She's wounded I know and feeling so low
She could fall at anytime
I don't know what I'd do if I were to lose
That precious angel of mine
Looking for my blue angel
The same one that flew from my arms last night
If you see my blue angel
Tell her that heaven without her feels like hell tonight
We're gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
And we'll bring it back no matter what it takes
We're gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
And he ain't gonna rest till you're in jail
Put that hammer down and give it hell
We're gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
Now that waitress done brought me cup of coffee
And I thanked her then I called her back again
I said you know that old song it sure does fit me
So pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
And put another quarter in that jukebox
Well I climbed back aboard my old semi
Then just like a flash I was gone
So pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
And put another quarter in that jukebox
So pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
And put another quarter in that jukebox
Find you on a rainy night
Those windshield wipers
With the song on the radio
Tried to talk me into a ride
Said I wouldn't be sorry
But she was just a baby
Another cup of coffee
Find you on a rainy night
Those windshield wipers
With the song on the radio
Well I pulled out of Pittsburgh rolling down the eastern seaboard
I've got me diesel wound up and she's running like a never before
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
I got ten forward gears and a Georgia overdrive
I'm passing little white lines and my eyes are open wide
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
Well it seems like a month since I kissed my baby goodbye
I could have a lot of woman but I'm not like some of the guys
But I could not make believe it's right
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
Well the ICC is checking on down the line
I'm a little overweight and my log books are way behind
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
My rigs a little old but that don't mean she's slow
There's a flame from her stack and the smoke's rolling black as coal
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
Six Days On The Road and
And it must have been around mid July
I got behind a chicken truck from Georgia
I couldn't get up the speed enough to pass him
Chicken truck chicken truck it's just my luck
Chicken truck chicken truck it's just my luck
Well they loaded up in Bakersfield
Running late no time to kill
Trying to beat the freezing rain
Because Danger Dave forgot the chains
Now where the 99 meets the 5
Few clicks north the old grapevine
Double trouble lost his nerve when he
Hit some ice we started to swerve
Well he lit a smoke and than he lit another
Started to choke he said
It's been three days sense I've seen a bed
This load of beer's gotta get to town
And Danger's at the wheel
Keep out of the ditches
Stay between the lines
Well he mashed her down and he hit full speed
Got him up a good head of steam
Ran the coup flew right by
Grapevine took it's share of souls
When that ice starts taking hold
Climbing it in a blaze of glory
Coming down that's a different story
Well sure enough they made the peak
What goes up must come down
Bout that time the trailer came around
Been pulling these hills most of my life
Gripped the wheel help her straight
Bout that time the whole rig began to rotate
And Danger's at the wheel
Keep out of the ditches
Stay between the lines
Now they were spinning down that super slab
And funny smell was filling the cab
Truck kept going round and round
All they could do was ride it down
They both knew that this was the end
Went down the ramp come up again
Somewhere they caught a break
Well all at once the ice is gone
They found a gear and headed home
Legend has it they were right on time
And Danger's at the wheel
Keep out of the ditches
Stay between the lines
As I pull it on to the interstate
I've got thirteen hours to make my destination
And I don't want to stop to check my weight
Call me a prisoner of the highway
Driven on by my restless soul
I'm a prisoner of the highway
I've run freight out of Wheeling West Virginia
And I've rolled tobacco out of the Carolinas
California winds into Birmingham
Some people work just to survive
But up here in this cab
Is the only time I'm alive
I'm a prisoner of the highway
Driven on by my restless soul
Call me a prisoner of the highway
Now I could give my hand to another line of work
But my heart would always be behind the wheel
Call me a prisoner of the highway
Driven on by my restless soul
I'm a prisoner of the highway
I'm a prisoner of the highway
Driven on by my restless soul
Call me a prisoner of the highway
Imprisoned by the freedom of the road
In the picture on the billboard in a field near the big old highway
A girl to look at him that way
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
I bet it wouldn't take her very long to be gone
I'd slow my Jimmy to 20
That's how many wrecks I see there every day
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
On Route 66 from the billboard to Chicago
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
I won't be around this old town anymore for a long long time
Gonna hit the road and start looking for end of that long white line
Gonna hit the road and start looking for end of that long white line
I walk up my baby was gone without her I don't need no home
Gonna hit the road and start looking for end of that long white line
Gonna hit the road and start looking for end of that long white line
Went to bank to get my dough I don't care where I go
Gonna push this rig till I push that gal right out of my mind
If somebody wants to know what's become of this so and so
This old rig is humming and rolling she's doing fine
If somebody wants to know what's become of this so and so
This old rig is humming and rolling she's doing fine
If somebody wants to know what's become of this so and so
I won't be around this old town anymore for a long long time
Gonna hit the road and start looking for end of that long white line
The white line is a lifeline to the nation.
And a steady hand to pull that load behind.
And a steady hand to pull that load behind.
Why don't you let me take the wheel for a while.
Turn your squelch to the right
That everybody calls CB.
And all them bears out there. Flip flop.
Now ahead of your children and ahead of your wife
When all of a sudden there come a call
Put the peddle to the metal and... let it roar
Hammer down... to Macon town...
Gonna see my momma... sure.
Let's... bring it on...
The Georgia line's... out of sight.
A right around seventy nine.
That old diesel juice
And everything was fine.
Uh oh. Bubble gum machine done hit the jackpot.
Right there and then it came to be wall to wall.
You're in a heap of trouble boy... that's for sure.
From the front door of that White Knight.
You boys gonna be here a spell.
Don't ever get no front door called the White Knight.
I'm gonna pull that old CB thing out by the wires.
Roll on daddy till you get back home
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
He's up and gone with the sun
He taught them this song to sing
Roll on daddy till you get back home
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
It rings but it's not his voice
In a snow bank in Illinois
For the weather had everything stalled
And they had checked all the houses and the local motels
When they had some more news they'd call
And she told them when they found him to tell him that she loved him
Roll on daddy till you get back home
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
Momma and the children will be waiting up all night long
When momma asked him to bring daddy home
And when the call came in it was daddy on the other end
Roll on daddy till you get back home
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
Roll on daddy till you get back home
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
I pulled over at a little truck stop just outside el Paso Texas one night
Walked Inside sat down beside this old truck driver
He beat the socks off me
Then it came time for us to go
So we walked outside I headed for my rig he headed for his
But just before he climbed up in that cab I saw him get down on his knee
And I heard him say this little prayer
Help me pull my way down the long highway
Keep my coffee hot and may my breaks stay cool
Keep my hands steady on the wheel
Keep me in control of this chrome and Steel
My only prayer is lord that you
If its rough or if its smooth
Living everyday giving all he can
And then it dawned on me maybe we should to
If its rough or if its smooth
This is the suffering voice of America crying out for relief
Now I don't know what a gallon of gas costs up on capitol hill
And the damage already done has been a mighty heavy toll
And if we're gonna fix it we gotta start right here at home
Every time a foreign tanker pulls up to our shore
They got us over a barrel while they bleed us a little more
And think how much it costs just to bring it all that way
Oh and God forbid if our oily friends should decide to cut us off
Yes and we recognize that need
Before this great big country comes grinding to a halt
The quarterback down at the school makes all the rules
And everybody wants to be just like him
There's a little girl in his homeroom class
And it don't seem fair but here's the deal
Brother here's the deal
Yeah it's who you know
Meet the man who owns it all
That's him there on the lobby wall
Don't he look like he's been carved from granite
And he only smokes the best cigars
And she prays someday that he'll see the light
Man I think she's got it right
At the end of the road
My friends and me work overtime
All try to walk the bottom line
But soon as we cash our paychecks
It's time to let the good times roll
We can't wait to punch the clock
Gonna fill my igloo full of ice
Stock up on my way home tonight
Put speakers on the windowsill
Play our music loud and dance all night
Run run Rudolph Vixen can't be far behind
Run run Rudolph Santa's got to make it to town
Run run Rudolph spinning like a merry go round
Said Santa to the boy child what would you be longing for
All I want for Christmas is a rock and roll electric guitar
Then away went Rudolph streaking like a shooting star
Run run Rudolph spinning like a merry go round
Said Santa to the girl child what would you be pleased most to get
A little Barbie doll that can cry sleep drink and wet
Then away went Rudolph streaking like a Citation jet
Run run Rudolph Santa got to make it to town
Run run Rudolph spinning like a merry go round
... Round round round round round
Run run Rudolph Santa's got to make it to town
Would you lay with me
If my needs were strong
Should my lips grow dry
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand
When the moon is full
Will you still love me
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand
Would you lay with me
If my needs were strong
I swore I'd never love again a promise I'd keep till the end
But then you made a liar out of me
But even a man of his words can't talk his way out of the hurt
When everything reminds him of his old used to be
But you made me forget about
What's her name I can't remember a thing because my mind is always on you
I just draw a blank every time I try to think about the girl who tore my heart in two
Girl I was down and out without a shadow of a doubt
Until you shined your love light on me
I lost my faith in love my soul had given up
It took a miracle to make me believe
But you made me forget about
What's her name I can't remember a thing because my mind is always on you
I just draw a blank every time I try to think about the girl who tore my heart in two
You made me forget about
What's her name I can't remember a thing because my mind is always on you
I just draw a blank every time I try to think about the girl who tore my heart in two
Growing up in a little town where there's not a lot to do
No matter where you go troubles bound to run into you
There was only one water hole this side of the county line
The boys and me would hang our clothes on the no trespassing sign
We'd go swimming swinging from the tire in the tree
And we'd go fishing but we never caught anything
Trespassing on old man walker's property
Well the older the old man got the meaner he seemed to be
I could tell when our eyes met he didn't care to much for me
I remember on Friday nights me and my girl would wait up late
When he'd turn off his front porch light we'd hop on over the gate
We'd go kissing underneath the cottonwood trees
And we'd go wishing on every star that we could see
Trespassing on old man walker's property
Not long ago I went back home for the labor day weekend
As I walked out of the store old man walker came walking in
He said I used to watch you one by one sneak under my gate
If you'd of known I was a teddy bear you wouldn't of had half the fun
He said boy if that was true would I have hung a tire swing in the tree
Hearing y'all laughing it really put a smile on my face
Seeing y'all splashing really brightened up this place
I drove down the old man's dirt road just as I was leaving
Out there in that water hole were little boys like I used to be
Trespassing on old man walker's property
While he's out running around with the boys at the bar downtown
His sweetheart sits at home all alone and she's waiting by the telephone
But he'll spend his quarter somewhere else
Well she's done what a good girl should but she's done all she could
So she packs her bags up for the next plain going home and he's crying by the telephone
But she'll spend her quarter somewhere else
And just a call to tell her that you love her
That is all she really ever wanted to hear
And it ain't asking much to tell her that you miss her
Just a call and that's all and she'd still be here
He spends a lot of time on the road breaking even with the rodeo
He knows he should call her but he's barely got enough and making ends meet is tough
So he'll spend his quarter somewhere else
He sings love songs underneath the neon lights while she alone tonight
Dreaming someday he'll live the songs he sings
If it was just another night like so many nights before Just
You're still awake and that girl is still on your mind
This time you're in it for more than just the chase
But she's not just another pretty face
You thought your heart was ten feet tall and bullet proof Till
A girl only five foot three shot you with the cold hard truth
Head But deep down their just jealous it's not them
Diamond ring I never thought you'd see the day
Not just another pretty face This time you're in it
I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn
You were laughing at me and looking mighty dandy
Licking your lips and your cotton candy
I fell in love with you right then and there
When I saw you at the Amarillo Fair
Time stood still as we rode the Ferris wheel
There I was on top of the world
So I asked you if I could hold your hand
That night I stole a kiss on the tunnel of love
And to this very day I still can't get enough
I fell in love with you right then and there when I saw you at the Amarillo Fair
My hearts a tilt a whirl since I gave it to you girl
I don't want this ride to ever end
Corn dogs and barbecue a frosted funnel cake and you
All made that night to good to be true
I fell in love with you right then and there when I saw you at the Amarillo Fair
I still can't hit the broad side of a barn
I've never won a thing till I gave you a diamond ring
Now I'm the luckiest man in the world
His mother begged him to be a cattleman
But he chose to wear the star his daddy wore
God blessed him with a sharp eye and a quick hand
Quicker than the man who shot his daddy to the floor
Still she prayed and she pleaded
But ranch work lacked the vengeance he needed
He was cursed on his daddy's dying day
When a shot to the back laid him in six feet in a grave
And he wears a star on his vest
The only thing between a bullet and the heart in his chest
He'll be a ranger till he takes his last draw
He was born with the strong arm of the law
He wore a colt 45 on his hip
One notch short on the ivory grip
Riding through the badlands from daylight to dark
In a dirty back water border town
Where the outlaw thought he could not be found
He looked like he'd seen a ghost when he saw the ranger's face
The outlaw had no place to run
So he turned to the trigger on his gun
As the smoke cleared blood stained the dusty street
The outlaw lay dying at the ranger's feet
He sat in the saddle and shook his head
His gun still hot and his father still dead
As the sun set on the day he'd waited so long for
She kissed me goodbye and then she drove away
And I don't know if she'll be back again
But I'll be right here where she left me
And I don't know if she'll be back again
But I'll be right here where she left me
There's no future in this jukebox town
So she took my heart with her guitar
And I don't know if she'll be back again
So don't try to hide the fire in your eyes
You must be stupid cause you just don't have a clue
Even hell frozen over is warmer than my love for you
When all those Aggies move to Austin
And Beaumont is covered in snow
When the wind don't blow in Amarillo
You sure can shake your little round behind
But your hour glass figure won't buy my time
You know how to work it Lord knows it's worked before
This time you leave your butt will have the imprint of the front door
When Fort Worth is east of Dallas
And Texans forget the Alamo
When Lubbock opens up a ski resort
And the Brazos is straighter than an arrow
When all those Aggies move to Austin
And Beaumont is covered in snow
When the wind don't blow in Amarillo
As soon as you walk in a waitress greets you with a grin
And says make yourself feel right at home
Old men sit at a booth telling tall tales and stretching the truth
They're all too tired to plow besides their tractors are rusted now
So they order hot apple pie with a cup of coffee
Some things will never change
After all these years the menu is still the same
Serving that sweet ice tea with a touch of southern hospitality
There's a Wurlitzer jukebox full of old forty fives
Playing three songs for a quarter or one for a dime
The cook said he was a boy when it was brand new
To him it seemed like yesterday but it was 1962
There was a family owned five and dime next door
That could not compete with a chain discount store
On the outskirts of town the drive in theater is shut down
With a screen without a hero since Audie Murphy
And an old courthouse with nobody left to blame
Town square is boarded up and brick roads are worn down
I've got a girl and Charlene is her name
Since she flipped her skirt at me I ain't never been the same
All of the boys in our trailer park
Would take a bath and go to school just to win her heart
Some people think the thing that I love most
Is the way that she butters up my toast
But most of most I love her lovely name
Just the other day we were riding in my car
We got to Charlene's trailer and I pulled up in the yard
On her front porch was her old boyfriend Chase
He blew a little kiss at her so I kicked him in the face
Some people think the thing that I love most
Is the way that she butters up my toast
But most of most I love her lovely name
Charlene's got a brother and his name is Jim
And she's got one other and his names the same as him
One of them is ugly and one of them is mean
But both of them together couldn't keep me from Charlene
Some people think the thing that I love most
Is the way that she butters up my toast
But most of most I love her lovely name
Charlene's mom and daddy bought a brand new double wide
And when she moved away from me I will admit I cried
But that Friday night at the local quickie mart
A pretty girl winked at me and nearly stole my heart
She may be sweet on me but she don't even know
It don't matter how she butters up my bread
I'll always love someone else instead
Some people think the thing that I love most
Is the way that she butters up my toast
But most of most I love her lovely name
And reminds me of the way that it used to be
Every time I hear those songs it makes me think about you
And how we used to sing along to all the ones that we knew
It's not that they aren't good I used to love them to
But every time I hear those songs it makes me think about you
He may have been the best friend that any song ever had
But when I hear that growl in his voice it always makes me sad
Lord only knows what I'd give if I could forget
Daddy left us when I was only three
Well... I been packed up some two weeks ago.
Her pickup truck will be next to mine.
Colorado's quite a sight
But I'd rather see my baby in those rugged mountain jeans.
So I'm going to Texas to see my baby tonight.
But even he fades out every now and then.
The closer I get seems the faster I go.
The only thing between us now is New Mexico.
It's just a matter of time before I hold her tight.
Sometimes she'll laugh
And sometimes she will cry
Sometimes she'll get mad at you
A woman's mind is a mystery
That no man can uncover
So don't waste your time trying to figure her out
Show her you love her
May be two different things
And the words you hear so clear
Aren't always what they mean
She may say that she's cold at night
Just to have you hold her
So don't waste your time trying to figure her out
Show her you love her
The ocean doesn't ask why
The moon pulls the tide
So don't question the feelings she feels inside
If you had all of the answers
Tell me what would it matter
So don't waste your time trying to figure her out show her you love her
If she smiles and says she loves you as the tears roll from her eyes
Then you've found a treasure
That only true love can find
A woman's heart has parts that will never be discovered
So don't waste your time trying to figure her out
Show her you love her
The ocean doesn't ask why the moon pulls the tide
So don't question the feelings she feels inside
If you had all of the answers
Tell me what would it matter
So don't waste your time trying to figure her out
Show her you love her
If you had all of the answers
Tell me what would it matter
So don't waste your time trying to figure her out
Thank God For Country Girls
Told all my buddies on the block goodbye
As we drove away I wiped a tear from my eye
But this is where the story begins
My daddy promised me I'd make new friends
But still I wondered how in a town of only ten
Have mercy it was love at first
Thank God for country girls
Big blue eyes and long blond curls
I wouldn't miss this for the whole wide world
Thank God for country girls
She was all by herself sitting at a corner booth
Wearing a summer dress and a pair of cowgirl boots
I looked down and my heart was gone
I asked if she had a dinner reservation
Hello love goodbye Mr. lonely
Thank God for country girls
Big blue eyes and long blond curls
I wouldn't miss this for the whole wide world
Thank God for country girls
Told my friends back home they were missing out
So they came to see what the fuss was all about
Thank God for country girls
Big blue eyes and long blond curls
I wouldn't miss this for the whole wide world
Thank God for country girls
Thank God for country girls
You're too hard to handle
Scandal after scandal
You must think I'm naive
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
It's wild alibis and those outrageous lies
You expect me to believe
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
It's time we call it quits
You know you may be fun for Saturday night
But the rest of the week is the pits
Measure what we have between the good and the bad
And there's just too much uncertainty
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Because you placed the blame on the pink champagne
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Anywhere from Tulsa to Tel Aviv
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
It's time we call it quits
You know you may be fun for Saturday night
But the rest of the week is the pits
There's always something up your sleeve
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
He starts to think when she winks that he's somewhere he shouldn't be
He may be alone but at home someone's wearing his ring
So he heads for the door and ignores the devil on his shoulder
He'll do the right thing but someone's gonna break down and hold her
In a room full of lies where love is stolen or put up for sale
If the walls could talk you know they'd have some stories to tell
Once again another man walks in and orders him drinks for two
Despite his wife and picture perfect life he's to good to be true
While he's flirting she'd swear he's working on a job out of town
In a room full of lies where love is stolen or put up for sale
If the walls could talk you know they'd have some stories to tell
It's a five star chain or a run down dirt cheap no name
With or without room service what done is the same
In a room full of lies where love is stolen or put up for sale
If the walls could talk you know they'd have some stories to tell
Like a killer at large
You strolled down Bourbon Street
With every man you meet
And I never saw the devil
Behind your rain blue eyes
Spellbound by your long legs and your little white lies
And when your love wears off
Well I was thumbing through the channels
And I saw a sight to see
Had she ever been to Texas where Bob Wills is still the king
Of cowgirls and cowboys know how to have a ball
And every night they'll tip a toast to the Lone Star state
Where the women are so fine and the music is so great
Don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it
So if you don't understand just drop what you're doing
Drive here as quick as you can
I'd even stop in Oklahoma if it was up to me
Don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it
Don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it
I want something with a swing to it
We both work hard for money already spent
Blaming each other for where it all went
Never thinking of love only paying the loans
Just once let's forget about making ends meet
Or whose got the nicest yard on the street
We're staying at home for a night on the town
Let those old records keep spinning around
Replace all our worries with some romance
Tell me you love me then we'll shut up and dance
When you're in my arms it makes me feel
How poor is a rich man who lives all alone
Let those old records keep spinning around
Replace all our worries with some romance
Tell me you love me then we'll shut up and dance
Let those old records keep spinning around
Replace all our worries with some romance
With the world in the palm of his hands
Slipping through his fingers just like grains of sand
He don't know his hourglass is losing time
Till she run out of patience and leaves him far behind
Some lovers gotta learn love the hard way
Before they understand the way they feel
Some lovers are slower than others
Some will come around and some never will
If only she had a dime every time he's done her wrong
Or for every one wondering why she's still holding on
She could buy that rodeo and shut it down
Some lovers gotta learn love the hard way
Before they understand the way they feel
Some lovers are slower than others
Some will come around and some never will
It may be his fault but she's still one to blame
For taking him back and playing his foolish games
Some lovers gotta learn love the hard way
Before they understand the way they feel
Some lovers are slower than others
He calls from a hotel in downtown Dallas
Says he won't be home for three more days
She gets so lonely in her Houston hill top palace
She rocks the baby to sleep then gets in bed
Reads romance novels of a love she once had
She closes her eyes and dreams about the man
Who gave her more than money and a call now and then
As the shine on her diamond starts to fade
She recalls the promises they made
But a bond can only bend so far before it breaks
She's stuck between a rock and a heartache
She tries to keep busy with her everyday routines
As she wipes off a picture frame from their wedding day
She wonders if he asked her again what would she say
She feels like she's stranded somewhere in no man's land
Well I've done some things that I can't undo
I took your trust and I tore it into
No man in his right mind would have said it's over
Still I told you goodbye completely sober
I wish I could say I'd been drinking
And blame the bottle but I've never been one to booze
Lord only knows what I was thinking
Wish I could say I'd been drinking
Even that's just a fool's excuse
My mama knows her baby boy knows better
It's gonna break her heart to hear we're not together
She's always said she cares so much for you
So what is she gonna say about the hell I've put you through
I wish I could say I'd been drinking
And blame the bottle but I've never been one to booze
Lord only knows what I was thinking
Wish I could say I'd been drinking
Even that's just a fool's excuse
Even Tennessee whiskey couldn't wash away the pain
Watered down with teardrops over light Kentucky rain
I wish I could say I'd been drinking
And blame the bottle but I've never been one to booze
Lord only knows what I was thinking
Wish I could say I'd been drinking
Even that's just a fool's excuse
I wish I could say I'd been drinking
And blame the bottle but I've never been one to booze
Lord only knows what I was thinking
Wish I could say I'd been drinking
I could have swore she came walking in
Forgot the words to a song that I wrote
Must be losing my mind once again
Her daddy is a southern Baptist preacher
I had to choose her or the bars where I sang
Now when I call I can't seem to reach her
I'm gonna find her if it's the last thing
So I'll drive all night long
Till I find where we went wrong
Just those lonely Lubbock lights
I was ready to give up the road
As I turned onto her street
But the silhouette there in her window
Was of someone who once looked like me
I'd placed a price on her heart
But someone else collected the bounty
Now this lost soul don't know where to start
I think I'm lost somewhere in Hale County
That west Texas wind grew colder
As I left her further behind me
Sometimes I stop and cry on the shoulder
But she wishes he was good for something
Besides his behind looking so fine
Well all her friends can't help but stare
Wish that they were in her boots
If you know what I mean
And it may sound crazy
But those wrangler butts
Drive the cowgirls nuts
Well he lays around all day long
Stays out at night until the break of dawn
Comes crawling in dragging
Well she'd love to kick him out
But she can't help but thinking about
All the women who are waiting line
And it may sound crazy
But those wrangler butts
It ain't healthy if they fit too tight
You know this could hurt a man
By the end of the night
It's a powerful thing
If they fit just right
All the ladies know it's a mighty beautiful sight
Well he's never been one for anything
He ain't got much going for him besides his good looks
You see he always stays in trouble
When it comes down to romance
It ain't a joke when they say the boy
Survives by the seat of his pants
And it may sound crazy
But those wrangler butts
Drive the cowgirls nuts
Yes it may sound crazy
But those wrangler butts
You warned me from the start not to let you break my heart
I guess you don't know who your talking too
I'll bet you money no matter how much honey
I'm about to change your point of view
You're messing with man on a mission
And a heart with hard headed ambition
You're messing with man on a mission
Darling I declare how dare you to compare
When you ain't ever loved no one like me
Unlike the other boys you may have played like toys
You warned me from the start not to let you break my heart
I guess you don't know who your talking too
I'll bet you money no matter how much honey
Deep in the mountain of Harlan County
Employed by the Cumberland coal company
But our labor union laws are coming on strong
So I drink this whiskey for my throat
Wear my hard hat and weathered coat
Early every morning I stand in line
Waiting to work these Kentucky coal mines
We enter the shaft around five thirty
We'll dig through a million tons of rock and clay
And we'll still be digging at the end of the day
Down on our knees we confess our sins
And pray that the roof above don't cave in
So bless our hearts and save or souls
And the air we breathe down in the devil's hole
Just last week when the the ceiling fell
The explosion trapped us in the depths of hell
The weight of the earth took poor Tucker's life
Leaving behind a hungry baby and wife
We dug out with our shovels and picks
But soon enough the black lung disease will make us sick
So bless our hearts and save or souls
And the air we breathe down in the devil's hole
I work deep in the mountains of eastern Kentucky
I know if I leave Harlan alive I'll be more than lucky
Wish I could go to Texas and plant some cottonseed
But moving takes money and I've got three mouths to feed
So I drink this whiskey for my throat
Wear my hard hat and weathered coat
Early every morning I stand in line
I got a letter from your lawyer
And you got one from mine
They say It's gonna be final
Once we sign that dotted line
We'll I guess we'll get our freedom
And a so called fresh new start
But when you take half of everything
You'll be taking half my heart
Our love got lost somewhere in life's complications
Torn between two lawyers and all their legal litigations
This ain't easy but it's what my heart has to do
I took down our wedding picture
From above the fireplace
And I stood there awhile
Starring at your pretty face
Have we lost our love
To differences we can't resolve
But if push comes to shove
Thank God no children are involved
I can still see you throwing your rose bouquet
I never thought I'd see the day we'd throw it all away
This ain't easy but it's what my heart has to do
I've done all I can do now all I can do is pray
And ask the Lord to let me hear you say
This ain't easy but it's what my heart has to do
He calls from a hotel in downtown Dallas
Says he won't be home for three more days
She gets so lonely in her Houston hill top palace
She rocks the baby to sleep then gets in bed
Reads romance novels of a love she once had
She closes her eyes and dreams about the man
Who gave her more than money and a call now and then
As the shine on her diamond starts to fade
She recalls the promises they made
But a bond can only bend so far before it breaks
She's stuck between a rock and a heartache

As she wipes off a picture frame from their wedding day
She wonders if he asked her again what would she say
She feels like she's stranded somewhere in no man's land
Lord don't you walk with a little
Coming from the heart and soul
Let them be your saving grace
If you want to hear some country
Then you've come to the right place
Like Willie and George Jones
You better stick around a while
We might just get along
Cause your momma raised you wrong
He's wrinkled and gray but he's still got the fire
And he sings on the stage like a bird on a wire
Everybody loves The Honky Tonk Kid
He got his first guitar when he was fifteen
Everybody loves The Honky Tonk Kid
Well the Honky Tonk Kid loves a honky tonk crowd
He picks them up when this world gets them down
All the smoke and the neon keep his pain here
Nobody knows The Honky Tonk Kid
Ten million fans and a hand full of friends
He'll go home alone when each night ends
He'll think about her and he'll twist off the lid
Cause nobody loves The Honky Tonk Kid
It won't be long the lord will take him away
But he'll draw a crowd just like he always did
I still think about us
In the rush that we felt
With the rag top down and the radio blasting
You were riding shot gun
In nothing but a bikini and a seat belt
Looking better than the law should have been allowing
We hit the corners going 90
Head over heels over you
Every feeling that we felt
Was a feeling that felt brand new
And you looked just like an angel
With that cross on your necklace
We'd drive on down to the river
Steaming up those windows
And how your daddy never found out about it
I looked into your eyes and I
I believed it with all my heart
I just didn't know any better
I'd do it all over again
All for the thrill of the ride
She said she was not the one for me
There was nothing I could do to change her mind
She said she was sorry but some things aren't meant to be
She was unaware that she was robbing her heart blind
What she don't know is I'll always love her forever
What she don't know is that I've never done her wrong
Underestimation will break her heart for sure
Won't hurt her but it's killing me
I play myself in a lonely game of pool
I chalk it up as he sits down by her side
Watching her dance with him
Around that empty hardwood floor
Is like putting sawdust in the wound
Now all the boys down at the shop know and they sure do find it funny.
Then I'm in a lot of trouble.
So I could buy this diamond ring for you.
The boys down at the shop know and they laugh until I cry
I am flat dead on my feet
I have had nothing to eat
I am sick of highways and cold hotels rooms
I have replay there in our soft bed
I am so tired of missing you
So let's turn out the lights
And lay here by my side
Give me the lose that I need
Baby let's love some sleep tonight
All these shows that I play
Stuck firm by my side
Waiting patiently for the man of your needs
So let's turn out the lights
And lay here by my side
Give me the love that I need
Baby let's lose some sleep tonight
Sweetheart one night together
We need the rest of forever making up for lost love
So let's turn out the lights
Give you the love that you need
Let's lose some sleep tonight
Well I'll put some diesel in the tank
Give that old Detroit a crank
We'll sit back and let that silver eagle fly
And don't forget to kiss your baby good bye
Stick out a thumb and bum a ride
Come see why they call this place God's country
From Amarillo to Zapata
Every town along the way from A to Z
Stick out a thumb and bum a ride
Come see why they call this place God's country
From Amarillo to Zapata
Every town along the way from A to Z
Well my mom called me up
And she gave me my last warning
Said there'll be hell to pay
Well once upon a time
When I held you in my arms
On a blanket in the grass
Where we'd watch the falling stars
Under that old maple tree
We'd share secrets in the dark
Now I sit here all alone
Watching children play
There were no tomorrow
Up until the day you went away
Now the stars don't shine
The way they used to do
Like they did when you were mine
Perhaps they're lonely too
You can barely read the names
That I carved inside a heart
Now I sit here all alone
Watching children play
Sometimes I think of you
And I just have to smile
Though forever never was
At least we had a little while
How time flies when you're young
Just like the flicker of a spark
Now I sit here all alone
Watching children play
I've got this Caribbean queen
You'd think you'd be the last thing on my mind
I've got a beautiful ocean view
Ten thousand miles from you
So Why couldn't I leave this broken heart behind
Pretty girls couldn't get any hotter
Maybe it'll come true and I won't miss you
Welcome to a fool's paradise
There's other fish in the sea
But your memory keeps reminding me I'm wrong
Pretty girls couldn't get any hotter
Maybe it'll come true and I won't miss you
Welcome to a fool's paradise
This time next week I'll be headed to Texas On a big jet airplane
Oh when I get home you know this broken heart is gonna hit
Pretty girls couldn't get any hotter
Maybe it'll come true and I won't miss you
Well my truck's wound up and it's ready to roll
Unless they're out to lunch at the Dairy Queen
Well just like my daddy I was born a drifter
Horns on the hood and forty channel CB
Well some things you never leave home without
And your Best Of Dale Watson on CD
Don't you get in my lane
Settled down long enough to replace the parts
Asphalt along the way
When the only friend you've got is the radio
And even he fades in and out every now and then
But maybe someday you'll find the right one
That'll shift the gears and let ya ride shotgun
I ain't got no blood in my veins
I just got them four lanes
Of hard Amarillo highway
Pinch me I must be dreaming waking up with you and feeling
The tender touch of your good morning kiss
No where else on earth is better than being next to you
God knows this kind of love only comes from up above
I'm next to heaven when I am next to you
You look just like an angel tangled in white satin sheets
Lying there with your hair all in a mess
I swear you look your best all dressed up next to nothing
I just called to say good bye
I'll be in fort worth
I'm gonna be right here in fort worth
So for what its worth that's where I'm gonna be
Before the pain I put you through
Those late night calls from those random county jails
I know I swore never to bother you again
But if you don't mind could you find the time to forward me my mail
Will you love me in a trailer
Till I can get up on my feet
If it's August in Arizona
Could your heart stand the heat
I could never be an actor
Trying to be what I can't be
If I'm just a farm boy on a tractor
Could you love me just for me
And I can't offer you the stars above
Just next to nothing except my love
Of every day that I have to live
Well old man Pete lives down the street
With his wife of sixty years
He said the hard times were bittersweet
And all they owned was a catalog from Sears
She'd stand by him win or lose
She says now that they have money
Her only weakness is spending it on shoes
And I can't offer you the stars above
Just next to nothing except my love
Of every day that I have to live
Lord don't you walk with a little
Coming from the heart and soul
Let them be your saving grace
If you want to hear some country
Then you've come to the right place
Like Willie and George Jones
You better stick around a while
We might just get along
Cause your momma raised you wrong
Songs About Saturday Night
They say he came out singing the moment he was born
And he'd sneak in those old honky tonks until they'd kick him out
And his daddy wonder how he learned all the stuff he sang about
Songs about mamas and trains
Songs about heart broke country boys
When he turned eighteen he went off to the war
His sweetheart wrote him letters she said she'd wait for sure
By the time he came back home she was nowhere to be found
So he packed his bags hit them honky tonks from town to town
And he moved back to the country when it was time to call it quits
Pinch me I must be dreaming waking up with you and feeling
The tender touch of your good morning kiss
No where else on earth is better than being next to you
God knows this kind of love only comes from up above
I'm next to heaven when I am next to you
You look just like an angel tangled in white satin sheets
Lying there with your hair all in a mess
I swear you look your best all dressed up next to nothing
She said she was not the one for me
There was nothing I could do to change her mind
She said she was sorry but some things aren't meant to be
She was unaware that she was robbing her heart blind
What she don't know is I'll always love her forever
What she don't know is that I've never done her wrong
Underestimation will break her heart for sure
Won't hurt her but it's killing me
I play myself in a lonely game of pool
I chalk it up as he sits down by her side
Watching her dance with him
Around that empty hardwood floor
Is like putting sawdust in the wound
Like a killer at large
You strolled down Bourbon Street
With every man you meet
And I never saw the devil
Behind your rain blue eyes
Spellbound by your long legs and your little white lies
And when your love wears off
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight.
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight.
But you locked me out of your mind. Left me standing here behind.
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight.
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight.
They're taking you away. Leaving me lonely.
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight.
With the world in the palm of his hands
Slipping through his fingers just like grains of sand
He don't know his hourglass is losing time
Till she run out of patience and leaves him far behind
Some lovers gotta learn love the hard way
Before they understand the way they feel
Some lovers are slower than others
Some will come around and some never will
If only she had a dime every time he's done her wrong
Or for every one wondering why she's still holding on
She could buy that rodeo and shut it down
Some lovers gotta learn love the hard way
Before they understand the way they feel
Some lovers are slower than others
Some will come around and some never will
It may be his fault but she's still one to blame
For taking him back and playing his foolish games
Some lovers gotta learn love the hard way
Before they understand the way they feel
Some lovers are slower than others
He starts to think when she winks that he's somewhere he shouldn't be
He may be alone but at home someone's wearing his ring
So he heads for the door and ignores the devil on his shoulder
He'll do the right thing but someone's gonna break down and hold her
In a room full of lies where love is stolen or put up for sale
If the walls could talk you know they'd have some stories to tell
Once again another man walks in and orders him drinks for two
Despite his wife and picture perfect life he's to good to be true
While he's flirting she'd swear he's working on a job out of town
In a room full of lies where love is stolen or put up for sale
If the walls could talk you know they'd have some stories to tell
It's a five star chain or a run down dirt cheap no name
With or without room service what done is the same
In a room full of lies where love is stolen or put up for sale
If the walls could talk you know they'd have some stories to tell
Well I'm trying not to panic but I'm getting all romantic
Getting soft with everything I say and do
I'm even putting down the toilet seat for you
And I knew then that I was in for it for sure
Now all the boys down at the shop know and sure do find it funny
If you're not in love
If you're not in love
If you're not in love
If you're not in love I'm in a lot of trouble
I get this lump in my throat to think I sold my boat
So I could buy this diamond ring for you
Now I'm hoping and I'm wishing since I can't go fishing
You don't make me sell my golf clubs too
Now all the boys down at the shop know and they laughed until I cried
Well I'll put some diesel in the tank
Give that old Detroit a crank
We'll sit back and let that silver eagle fly
And don't forget to kiss your baby good bye
Stick out a thumb and bum a ride
Come see why they call this place God's country
From Amarillo to Zapata
Every town along the way from A to Z
Stick out a thumb and bum a ride
Come see why they call this place God's country
From Amarillo to Zapata
Every town along the way from A to Z
Well my mom called me up
And she gave me my last warning
Said there'll be hell to pay
We both work hard for money already spent
Blaming each other for where it all went
Never thinking of love only paying the loans
Just once let's forget about making ends meet
Or whose got the nicest yard on the street
We're staying at home for a night on the town
Let those old records keep spinning around
Replace all our worries with some romance
Tell me you love me then we'll shut up and dance
When you're in my arms it makes me feel
How poor is a rich man who lives all alone
Let those old records keep spinning around
Replace all our worries with some romance
Tell me you love me then we'll shut up and dance
Let those old records keep spinning around
Replace all our worries with some romance
Well my truck's wound up and it's ready to roll
Unless they're out to lunch at the Dairy Queen
Well just like my daddy I was born a drifter
Horns on the hood and forty channel CB
Well some things you never leave home without
And your Best Of Dale Watson on CD
Don't you get in my lane
Settled down long enough to replace the parts
When the only friend you've got is the radio
And even he fades in and out every now and then
But maybe someday you'll find the right one
I ain't got no blood in my veins
I just got them four lanes
Of hard Amarillo highway
I still think about us
In the rush that we felt
With the rag top down and the radio blasting
You were riding shot gun
In nothing but a bikini and a seat belt
Looking better than the law should have been allowing
We hit the corners going 90
Head over heels over you
Every feeling that we felt
Was a feeling that felt brand new
And you looked just like an angel
With that cross on your necklace
We'd drive on down to the river
Steaming up those windows
And how your daddy never found out about it
I looked into your eyes and I
I believed it with all my heart
I just didn't know any better
I'd do it all over again
All for the thrill of the ride
I got a letter from your lawyer
And you got one from mine
They say It's gonna be final
Once we sign that dotted line
We'll I guess we'll get our freedom
And a so called fresh new start
But when you take half of everything
You'll be taking half my heart
Our love got lost somewhere in life's complications
Torn between two lawyers and all their legal litigations
This ain't easy but it's what my heart has to do
I took down our wedding picture
From above the fireplace
And I stood there awhile
Starring at your pretty face
Have we lost our love
To differences we can't resolve
But if push comes to shove
Thank God no children are involved
I can still see you throwing your rose bouquet
I never thought I'd see the day we'd throw it all away
This ain't easy but it's what my heart has to do
I've done all I can do now all I can do is pray
And ask the Lord to let me hear you say
This ain't easy but it's what my heart has to do
I got a broken heard that's all I got
You made me cry and I cried a lot
You told our friends I was passing by
That you're not sorry that you made me cry
You said I deserved just what I got
I got a broken heard that's all I got
You made me cry and I cried a lot
Now all I've got is a broken heart
We loved a little and you laughed a lot
You're too hard to handle
Scandal after scandal
You must think I'm naive
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
It's wild alibis and those outrageous lies
You expect me to believe
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
It's time we call it quits
You know you may be fun for Saturday night
But the rest of the week is the pits
Measure what we have between the good and the bad
And there's just too much uncertainty
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Because you placed the blame on the pink champagne
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Anywhere from Tulsa to Tel Aviv
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
It's time we call it quits
You know you may be fun for Saturday night
But the rest of the week is the pits
There's always something up your sleeve
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
He's wrinkled and gray but he's still got the fire
And he sings on the stage like a bird on a wire
Everybody loves The Honky Tonk Kid
He got his first guitar when he was fifteen
Everybody loves The Honky Tonk Kid
Well the Honky Tonk Kid loves a honky tonk crowd
He picks them up when this world gets them down
All the smoke and the neon keep his pain here
Nobody knows The Honky Tonk Kid
Ten million fans and a hand full of friends
He'll go home alone when each night ends
He'll think about her and he'll twist off the lid
Cause nobody loves The Honky Tonk Kid
It won't be long the lord will take him away
But he'll draw a crowd just like he always did
Well I was thumbing through the channels
And I saw a sight to see
Had she ever been to Texas where Bob Wills is still the king
Of cowgirls and cowboys know how to have a ball
And every night they'll tip a toast to the Lone Star state
Where the women are so fine and the music is so great
Don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it
So if you don't understand just drop what you're doing
Drive here as quick as you can
I'd even stop in Oklahoma if it was up to me
Don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it
Don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it
I want something with a swing to it
I said hey sugar mama
I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
And later on we just might
Go make a little love beneath the moon above
Sugar mama I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
Well I've been pushed down kicked around
All over town all week
Nice guys end up last in line
There's only one thing on Gods green earth
To get this cruel world off my mind
I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
And later on we just might
Go make a little love beneath the moon above
I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
Id say Monday is the worst day
Sugar mama I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
And later on we just might
Go make a little love beneath the moon above
Sugar mama I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
And let your troubles take flight
I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
So lets make a little love beneath the moon above
In the glow of a kerosene light
Till we turn it on just right
Sugar mama I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
This empty pillow by my head is proof you sleep in the bed that you make
To bring my baby back
Maybe she was long gone long before she ever set foot out that door
I guess over time the love in her heart was overshadowed by her heartaches
There goes my life down that highway
I've gotta put the pieces all back together
Like that old Titanic
Running full steam ahead
You fogged up my mind
With love words you said
I could not see the danger
Till my ship was sinking
I didn't know my heart
I couldn't see the truth
Till it was in my face
If I'd seen it coming
I could have turned away
I didn't know my heart
Now the door went under
In an ocean of regret
With no hope of rescue
From love I can't forget
I never knew just what hit me
I never knew my heart
I didn't know my heart
I couldn't see the truth
Till it was in my face
If I'd seen it coming
I could have turned away
I didn't know my heart
I didn't know my heart
I couldn't see the truth
Till it was in my face
If I'd seen it coming
I could have turned away
I didn't know my heart
I didn't know my heart
Whenever she walks flowers grow in her footsteps
Whenever she talks all the birds hush their singing
The heart of a saint and the face of an angel
Absolutely unbelievably beautiful
She'll take my frown and she'll turn it back around
Acting crazy as a fool
Absolutely unbelievably beautiful
Wasn't turned on just by her looks alone
She's an angel on loan from up above
She'll set the mood and put some soft slow music on
And all 7 wonders ain't half as wonderful
Never ceases to amaze me
The epitome of what love should be
There's a ghost for every memory
What was once a happy home
Feels more like a haunted house
Haunted by the sounds of broken hearts
It sends a chill through my bones
It's got me scared as a mouse
What was once a happy home
Feels more like a haunted house
There's no place to run and hide
I swear she's everywhere I go
I know she's not here
It sends a chill through my bones
It's got me scared as a mouse
What was once a happy home
I'm a game that you used to play
And I'm a plan that you didn't lay so well
And I'm a fire that burns in your mind
So close your eyes I'm a memory
I'm a love that you bought for a song
And I'm a voice on a green telephone
And I'm a day that lasted so long
So close your eyes I'm a memory
I'm a dream that comes with the night
And I'm a face that fades with the light
And I'm a tear that falls out of sight
So close your eyes I'm a memory
I'm a love that you bought for a song
And I'm a voice on a green telephone
And I'm a day that lasted so long
We'd find a soft place to watch the sun go down
So was it me or was it what I could not give you
She said time would heal my broken heart
And I'd find a true companion for my soul
Nothing more than a pretty song
About a boy who loved a girl
In the chapel where she said we'd wed someday
It rattled me so to hear them old church bells ringing
Knowing well enough we'd never love that way
Looking back it was a blessing she broke my heart in two
It was his way or the high way
To help him gain control
He wore his own kind of hat
And for that folks called him an outlaw
Well some even cussed his name
He strummed the beat of a different drum
And he said he wouldn't change for no one
Well she never tried to change him
But she loved him and gave him a son
And Lord knows she was a good wife
He wore his own kind of hat
And for that folks called him an outlaw
Well some even cussed his name
He strummed the beat of a different drum
And he said he wouldn't change for no one
He wore his own kind of hat
And for that folks called him an outlaw
Well some even cussed his name
He strummed the beat of a different drum
And he said he wouldn't change for no one
Your looking for good ways to tell me goodbye
Something about people how they never know
They're loving somebody then letting them go
Your looking for reasons there ain't no need
You can blame it on me.
You can blame it on me. I was the one
Acting like real life was some old love song
You can't loose your cool these days I know
So I'll go on home and you can feel free
You can blame it on me
I'm not the picture of anyone's dreams
When you start looking
Then I've been making mistakes by the dozen
So if you wanna leave
You can blame it on me
You can't loose your cool these days I know
So I'll go on home and you can feel free
If you'd had made a tag on the back
And you from what she's got on
You wouldn't think she'd know every Merle Haggard song by
But when it comes down to the heart of the situation
Rich lady shades and a little dog in the window
You'd never know she was born and raised right down on her
But when it comes down to the heart of the situation
It sweet talks me into anything
Brings any country boy down to his knees
But when it comes down to the heart of the situation
Will bring us joys to share
With those who really care
Will bring us joys to share
With those who really care
With her little one in one arm
And the laundry in the other
She could sure use a helping hand
But that's just the life of a single mother
Somebody's calling on the phone
Somebody's knocking at the door
She forgets and burns the dinner
Throws it across the kitchen floor
And for a moment she wants to give up and break down
But nobody's crying but the baby
She ain't far from going crazy
And there are times she wonders how she's going to make it
But she's got to be strong enough for two
She's gotta do what he wouldn't do
No time for tears around here
Nobody's crying but the baby
And when the day is done
She'll tuck her angel in
She'll turn out the lights and start missing him again
Her mascara slowly runs down her face
But nobody's crying but the baby
She ain't far from going crazy
And there are times she wonders how she's going to make it
But she's got to be strong enough for two
She's gotta do what he wouldn't do
No time for tears around here
But the baby is getting older
The lonely nights are getting colder
And what she wouldn't give to have a shoulder to cry on
But she's got to be strong enough for two
She's gotta do what he wouldn't do
No time for tears around here
Lord only knows why she loved a guy like you
You turned your back on her and broke her heart in two
And the only reason I ain't got you
She begged me not to says she loves you
If the sun goes down on you
She's the only thing I've ever really cared for
No she don't deserve this kind of shame
She carries a burden around that
You know you are to blame for
And you just laughed and said
And the only reason I ain't got you
Cause you can't put out an old flame
By pouring whiskey on the fire
And tonight he'll make a toast to her memory
And then he'll take another shot of a 100 proof of misery
And his old broken heart still burns with desire
Cause you can't put out an old flame
By pouring whiskey on the fire
His tears fall like rain but his pain just wont die down
As he buys another round
Hey honey so what we had a little fight
We both said some things that we didn't mean last night
Yeah we should of kissed and made up instead of giving up
And getting up on the wrong side of the bed
And lord knows that I'm an early riser
And with this new day he sent me a reminder
So what part of I love you don't you understand
And if you still can't see you're the one and only one for me
And always will be heres a kiss and a cup
Sweetheart wake up and smell the coffee
Just bad news and headlines of hatred and anger
This old cruel world they'll try to bring it to the ground
Honey ain't that just like a woman
Then again ain't that just like a man
Acting bullet proof and ten foot tall
Heres a kiss and a cup
Heres a kiss and a cup
Heres a kiss and a cup
Girl I hate to see you cry
Laying there in that position
There's things you need to hear
So turn off your tears and listen
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way that it should
But I know the heart of life is good
Now you know it's nothing new
Bad news never had good timing
There in the circle of your friends
We'll defend the silver lining
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
But I know the heart of life is good
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
Fear is a friend who is misunderstood
About somebody who done somebody wrong
We could kick it off slow with a bottle of wine
Or get straight to the old punch line
Either way it starts it's gonna end
With an all night long
Its guaranteed to be off the charts
Solid gold number one in my heart
The sweet things you say and do
And baby you got a few ideas of your own
Well kiss for kiss and note for note
Shut the door and lock the dead bolt
Breaker breaker one nine is someone out there on that line
If you see my girl won't you please remind her
I'm gonna keep that hammer down until I find her
Unhitched my heart hit the road around nightfall
She never said where she was going but she said where I could go
Breaker breaker one nine is someone out there on that line
If you see my girl won't you please remind her
That my heart is breaking but I don't smell no bacon
So I'm gonna keep that hammer down until I find her
Well we took that big trip on down the aisle
Everything was hunky dory for a while
I can hardly see the road with this truck load of tears
Breaker breaker one nine is someone out there on that line
If you see my girl won't you please remind her
I've got Smokey on my tail and unless I go to jail
Now he don't expect her to stay true to him
And she never says that she will
But hes got a first love that just might kill him
And she knows hes hooked on the thrill
So she'll wait and worry then she'll wait some more
For the fever that drives him to just run its course
She talks to that picture they took their last night
Says you can't be a cowboy forever
No you can't be a cowboy forever
Sometimes he calls her he swears that the ground hurts
More than it did yesterday
She knows his voice and he still sounds determined to do
So she'll wait and worry then she'll wait some more
For the fever that drives him to just run its course
The whiskey he drinks said some things last spring
Lord he can't be a cowboy forever
No you can't be a cowboy forever
Then one night he shows up and says what's for dinner
With that cocky grin on his face the way that she smiled
She closed her eyes and he put that ring on her finger
Said you can't be a cowboy forever
No you can't be a cowboy forever
I can still see you standing there next to me in the county fair ticket line
We've come a long way through the years had our fair share of heartache and tears
I know no matter the size of the mountain you and me will be side by side
Back in the day we were cool and crazy like two outlaws on the run
Now making love means making babies and I swear we're having twice the fun
It's been no walk in the park but then again that's not our style
It wouldn't be too entertaining without a little drama every once in awhile
I don't believe there's ever been such a beautiful sight.
Hearts are breaking across Texas tonight.
Hearts are breaking across Texas tonight
Hearts are breaking across Texas tonight
She's as pure as a Sunday morning
Just as fun as a Saturday night
She's as pretty as a stain glass window
She's always shining like a neon light
When I'm holding her here in my arms
I feel as if there's nothing I can't do
But just the thought of her leaving me
Leaves me helpless and broken in two
My sweet contradiction knows well the chains that bind me
My cure and my addiction is her love and only her love
And no I don't understand what did I do to deserve to be her man
She's such an angel so why is she flying so low
So she can love someone like me
She's my sweet contradiction
By that look on your face
I know you know what's on my mind
Honey it's really half your fault
Standing there looking that fine
I swear I can't believe my eyes
You look so good it almost hurts
Wearing nothing but a smile
And one of my old favorite sweatshirts
If you're wanting a reaction
Girl I'm fixing to ignite
You say it takes two to tango
Just like I felt the very first time
And I have to pinch myself cause
I still can't believe you're mine
Lord knows I'm blessed to be the man
Who gets to sweep you off your feet
You know I never miss a beat
There's a full moon shining and
Baby we're both fixing to find
What you get when you mix
He read the bible seven times and he believed every word
He sat on the back pew so he could chew him a chaw singing
He carried candy for the kids in his Sunday dress coat
He told the whole congregation that I was his grandkid
And today he joined up with Jesus wearing shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns and then the soldier played taps
I bet he's walking with Pete down a street paved with gold
Showing off his brand spanking new wings and his barbed wire halo
He married sweet Emma Grace before the war was through
She held his right arm next to his anchor tattoo
He lost his whole world from the far side of the earth
Until he met a man who taught him to forgive
But in the end he beat the devil until he was black and blue
Before he went he made me promise him that I wouldn't cry
And though I told him that I wouldn't you know I couldn't help but lie
Cause today he joined up with Jesus wearing shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns and then the soldier played taps
I bet he's walking with Pete down a street paved with gold
As sure as the old church bell still rings
He always said he had country in his soul
He's showing off his brand spanking new wings and barbed wire halo
Sweet chariot coming forth to carry me home
He read the bible seven times
And he believed every word
He sat on the back pew so he could chew him a chaw
He carried candy for the kids in his Sunday dress coat
And taught me things I needed to know
Lord knows he wished he did
He told the whole congregation that I was his grandkid
And today he joined up with Jesus
Wearing shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns
And then the soldier played taps
And his barbed wire halo
He married sweet Emma Grace before the war was through
She held his right arm next to his anchor tattoo
He was on a ship off at sea when she died in child birth
He lost his whole world from the far side of the earth
He lost the will to love
He lost the will to live
Until he met a man who taught him to forgive
Yeah life took him to hell and back
To hell and back a time or two
But in the end he beat the devil until he was black and blue
Before he went he made me promise him that I wouldn't cry
And though I told him that I wouldn't I couldn't help but lie
Cause today he joined up with Jesus
Wearing shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns
And then the soldier played taps
I bet he's walking with Pete down the street paved with gold
As sure as the old church bell still rings
He always said he had country in his soul
He's showing off his brand spanking new wings
And his barbed wire halo
I heard someone out poking fun
Still cracking jokes he sarcastically implied
That's what I like about a country song
Where somebody done somebody wrong
By those high rollers in Hollywood
That's what I like about a country song
Some like it fast and some like it slow
If you're left or right or right down the middle
Everybody stops to listen when that bow hits the fiddle
Hot mamas driving to the grocery store
The truckers and the teachers
Even Church of Christ preachers
That's what I like about a country song
Where somebody done somebody wrong
By those high rollers in Hollywood

When you're at that judgment throne
Some days are diamonds
Some roads are blocked
And if I never do nothing
I'll get you back someday
You got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
All around your island
It keeps out the dangers
And holds in the pain
Sometimes you're happy
And half of me is ocean
And half of me is sky
It could crush this town
I can't hold out forever
And part of me is gone
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
He made the heavens and the earth
Separated day from night
He made man and it was good
Still something wasn't right
And all creation stood in awe
At the woman standing there
Wearing nothing but a smile
And a flower in her hair
What the world would be like without a girl like you
Your love's the kind of beautiful
That will never be surpassed
Now I know why he saved the best for last
There was someone who broke my heart
Long before I fell for you
I would have swore she was the one
I thought she was my dream come true
As all the walls came crashing down
I hit my knees right there
Looking back I'm thanking God
For that unanswered prayer
What the world would be like without a girl like you
Your love's the kind of beautiful
That will never be surpassed
Now I know why he saved the best for last
How can I describe my love for you
You're my life you're my whole wide world
It's kinda like a feeling I feel holding our new born baby girl
What the world would be like without a girl like you
Your love's the kind of beautiful
That will never be surpassed
Now I know why he saved the best for last
She was home all alone on a Saturday Night
She laughed and thought to herself
Well luckily gave her a age and occupation
How much do you make what do you love to do
Take care congratulations found the perfect match for you
She thought ooh. last thing I need is another
Pickup truck and some pickup line ooh. from some wannabe cowboy
Wasting my time with red roses and wine
He had nothing to lose so he gave it a try
He thought ooh. last thing I need is another pretty girl
Who just wants to have fun ooh. but when he read what she wrote
I like to get a little loud
Goes without saying I suppose
I've got this thing for old guitars
Seems I'm always on the fly
She brings my temperature back down
And I know without her love I'd fall apart
That girl of mine must be plum half way out of her mind
I'm like a full time job
Sometimes a household chore
I wonder when she said I do
If she truly ever knew
What our future had in store
Somehow she still believes in me
Through all my many winds of change
Some have faith it will move a mountain
Lord she's got the kind that will move the mountain range
And I know without her love I'd fall apart
That girl of mine must be plum half way out of her mind
And I know without her love I'd fall apart
That girl of mine must be plum half way out of her mind
A love like this is like a slow train
My life is borderline insane
Without her love I'd fall apart
That girl of mine must be plum half way out of her mind
That girl of mine must be plum half way out of her mind
I sat down at a park bench watching my children play
When this old timer took a seat he said hello how's your day
Said to tell you the truth I shouldn't be here doing this
Between the headlines and deadlines I've got no time to reminisce
That's when he said sounds like you're a busy man son that ain't front page news
He said once upon a time I was wearing your brand of boots so listen up
I've gone the wrong way I've learn the hard way
Baby's crawls then they walk before you know it
As your staring at the tail lights you can feel life passing you by
It goes zero to sixty in the blink of the eye
He took a picture from his wallet that he carried threw out the war
Of the beautiful brunet he married in 1944
My angel flew way it's almost been five years
And he told me her name then he wiped away his tear
Then he said take a look at your little girl
Enjoy that little girl smile
Because on day your gonna turn around you'll be walking her down the isle
So count your many blessing and love with all your heart and hold on tight
You better cherish every morning and hit your knees every night
So I said lord I've gone the wrong way I've learned the hard way
We live we die the years fly by like white lines on the high way
Slow me down and make me see
The kind of man I need to be
Zero to sixty lives goes zero to sixty the old man said
I've gone the wrong way I've learn the hard way
Baby crawls then they walk before you know it
As your staring at the tail lights you can feel life passing you by
Well rumor has it so they say
She was broke down on the highway
She was underneath the hood
The two came up on each side and said
Hey honey you want a ride
One winked and the other gave her a little pinch
And so the story goes she hauled off and broke his nose
With her daddy's diamond horseshoe monkey wrench
She's no sweetheart of the rodeo
Well pretty girls these days get straight on top in so many ways
She just naturally looks fine in those tight blue jeans
She's no sweetheart of the rodeo
No she's no sweetheart of the rodeo
Boys you been warned so now you know
So straighten up and act your age
She's no sweetheart of the rodeo
She's no sweetheart of the rodeo
Those who don't have a clue.
You're fighting this rain.
You're willing the shine.
You can't help yourself.
But I know you are trying.
When your heart and your head disagree
Then I'll bet if you made them unite
There would be such a fight
Over what they should do
With this problem and you
Don't know how to resolve this conflict
Still chasing a dream
You're facing the facts
The weight of the reel
When your heart and your head disagree
Then I'll bet if you made them unite
There would be such a fight
Over what they should do
With this problem and you
Don't know how to resolve this conflict
I wish this world apart
Where I could give you all the answers
But the fight continues on
And the fact of the matter
Is I am convinced we all
Spend far too much time on the fence
Tell me which is right
When your heart and your head disagree
Then I'll bet if you made them unite
There would be such a fight
Over what they should do
With this problem and you
Don't know how to resolve this conflict
Don't know how to resolve this conflict
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you
Houston means the last day of the tour and we're through
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you
Was a great time for me and the guys
Time always never flies
Sure makes a cowboy blue
And I'm one day closer to you
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you
Houston means the last day of the tour and we're through
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you
Houston means the last day of the tour and we're through
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you
The full moons glowing out so bright
It's light out on the highway
I can't hear the engine for the
Wheels out on the road
The wind is blowing freezing
But it keeps my eyes wide open
And it hauls a heavy load
I got to tell her that I'm sorry
I got to tell her I was wrong
I got to show her I still love her
100 miles from no where
There are houses on the highway
Empty and a dark place
That someone once called home
Maybe they put sheets on chairs
And tables like the movies
But I know in that in real life
There as empty as my soul
I got to tell her that I'm sorry
I got to tell her I was wrong
I got to show her I still love her
And if I fail and I turn my wheel
Into that semi coming
I know well that there's a man in there
Just trying to get home
And waiting up and worrying
Is a woman loves him dearly
Ain't thinking clearly
People think I'm lazy
People think I'm crazy
And I don't know that she's gone
But I know that I got 200 miles
I don't think too much
I got to tell her that I'm sorry
I got to tell her I was wrong
I got to show her I still love her
I got to tell her that I'm sorry
I got to tell her I was wrong
I got to show her I still love her
And another night out on the interstate
It's not exactly where he thought he'd be
When he reached this age
There is an old man staring back at him in the rear view
With a million miles of life in his eyes
And makes him ask those questions he don't want to
Does a shooting star miss the sky
And how long can a woman go on loving you
The years are flying faster now
So tell me how eight seconds feel so slow
And I wonder where old cowboys go
There's a house and eighty acres he calls home
When he's not on the road
And a woman who's been true to him so long
And on nights like this he'll miss her most of all
His body and his mind knows that he needs to find
A softer place to fall
Does a shooting star miss the sky
And how long can a woman go on loving you
The years are flying faster now
So tell me how eight seconds feel so slow
And I wonder where old cowboys go
Hall. I smile when I think about
I love the way my lips look on you.
What he can to survive. Single mom with a dead end job. 90 hour week just to keep what she's got. But the bills add up
Afraid cause it will never walk away.
Is turn around. All you gotta do is turn around.
You don't have to take the broken road. You can turn around and come back home.
You don't have to take the broken road. You can turn around and come back home.
No one listens to you anymore. Any your heart has broken down. You don't need to move. Love has come to you. All you
Gotta do is turn around.
In the rain and the mud in July in Cheyenne
They had to carry away that brave young man
A little part of every heart of every rodeo fan
Died there in the rain and the mud in July in Cheyenne
Why he died that day is hard to understand
Right there in the rain and the mud in July in Cheyenne
So tip your hat to the cowboy every once in a while
And take time to remember that cowboy's smile
A little part of every heart of every rodeo fan
Died there in the rain and the mud in July in Cheyenne
No buckles on a shelf collecting dust
Still his memory shines inside of all of us
His mom and daddy long to see their little boy again
In the rain and the mud in July in Cheyenne
They had to carry away that brave young man
If you're washed in the blood someday you'll see him again
And he tore your dreams in two.
Get your rear back in the water.
Or tie on a hula popper.
You gotta cast it out again.
You know you'll never catch a keeper
If you sit around and cry.
And threw you right back in the lake.
About sticks and rocks.
Even though you'd like to smack her
You gotta cast it out again.
You know you'll never catch a keeper
If you sit around and cry.
Like happy ever after ain't never gonna work.
The last one you drug in
You gotta cast it out again
You know you'll never catch a keeper
If you sit around and cry
You gotta cast it out again.
You know you'll never catch a keeper
If you sit around and cry.
And the heart so hollow
You're saying I'm fragile
But I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door
I need you to love me
Give to me your leather
With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave
Sometimes I'm a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
I need you to love me
Give to me your leather
I need you to love me
Give to me your leather
Now first of all I gotta warn you. Before you fall in love with me.
So if you think you can take it. And enjoy the nonsense and the noise.
In a king size bed that's always lonely. Whenever I walk out your door.
But if you think you can take it. And enjoy the nonsense and the noise.
There's something about them neon signs. I'm like a moth drawn to a flame.
So if you think you can take it. And enjoy the nonsense and the noise.
Got my baby up in my deer blind.
God I got my baby up in my deer blind.
Never knew they made Mossy Oak negligee
God I got my baby up in my deer blind.
Thank God I got my baby up in my deer blind.
God I got my baby up in my deer blind.
I'm the name of the game and they call me Country.
And my granny likes a chew and chaw.
You know I got a jacked up pickup truck
I got it decked out like a Country pimp
I'll even let you twirl my fuzzy dice.
Crazy white boy from the south
And if you see any folk got a problem with that
I'm the name of the game and they call me Country.
And my granny likes a chew and chaw.
I like Johnny Cash Grand Master Flash
I won't try it unless you fry it
Put the Crisco in the pan.
I love fresh fried red hot hush puppies.
I got gravy running down my chin.
I'm the name of the game and they call me Country.
And my granny likes a chew and chaw.
Now all these hot senoritas want to ride with me
Country Girls on my hook.
Knocking my gold belt buckle and my snake skin boots.
But I'm in it to win it so place your bets
And tell the whole world that I'm the Honky Tonk Kid.
I'm the name of the game and they call me Country.
And my granny likes a chew and chaw.
He read the bible seven times
And he believed every word
He sat on the back pew so he could chew him a chaw
He carried candy for the kids in his Sunday dress coat
And taught me things I needed to know
Lord knows he wished he did
He told the whole congregation that I was his grandkid
And today he joined up with Jesus
Wearing shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns
And then the soldier played taps
And his barbed wire halo
He married sweet Emma Grace before the war was through
She held his right arm next to his anchor tattoo
He was on a ship off at sea when she died in child birth
He lost his whole world from the far side of the earth
He lost the will to love
He lost the will to live
Until he met a man who taught him to forgive
Yeah life took him to hell and back
To hell and back a time or two
But in the end he beat the devil until he was black and blue
Before he went he made me promise him that I wouldn't cry
And though I told him that I wouldn't I couldn't help but lie
Cause today he joined up with Jesus
Wearing shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns
And then the soldier played taps
I bet he's walking with Pete down the street paved with gold
As sure as the old church bell still rings
He always said he had country in his soul
He's showing off his brand spanking new wings
And his barbed wire halo
I still think about us
In the rush that we felt
With the rag top down and the radio blasting
You were riding shot gun
In nothing but a bikini and a seat belt
Looking better than the law should have been allowing
We hit the corners going 90
Head over heels over you
Every feeling that we felt
Was a feeling that felt brand new
And you looked just like an angel
With that cross on your necklace
We'd drive on down to the river
Steaming up those windows
And how your daddy never found out about it
I looked into your eyes and I
I believed it with all my heart
I just didn't know any better
I'd do it all over again
All for the thrill of the ride
I got a letter from your lawyer
And you got one from mine
They say It's gonna be final
Once we sign that dotted line
We'll I guess we'll get our freedom
And a so called fresh new start
But when you take half of everything
You'll be taking half my heart
Our love got lost somewhere in life's complications
Torn between two lawyers and all their legal litigations
This ain't easy but it's what my heart has to do
I took down our wedding picture
From above the fireplace
And I stood there awhile
Starring at your pretty face
Have we lost our love
To differences we can't resolve
But if push comes to shove
Thank God no children are involved
I can still see you throwing your rose bouquet
I never thought I'd see the day we'd throw it all away
This ain't easy but it's what my heart has to do
I've done all I can do now all I can do is pray
And ask the Lord to let me hear you say
This ain't easy but it's what my heart has to do
You're too hard to handle
Scandal after scandal
You must think I'm naive
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
It's wild alibis and those outrageous lies
You expect me to believe
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
It's time we call it quits
You know you may be fun for Saturday night
But the rest of the week is the pits
Measure what we have between the good and the bad
And there's just too much uncertainty
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Because you placed the blame on the pink champagne
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Anywhere from Tulsa to Tel Aviv
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
It's time we call it quits
You know you may be fun for Saturday night
But the rest of the week is the pits
There's always something up your sleeve
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
He's wrinkled and gray but he's still got the fire
And he sings on the stage like a bird on a wire
Everybody loves The Honky Tonk Kid
He got his first guitar when he was fifteen
Everybody loves The Honky Tonk Kid
Well the Honky Tonk Kid loves a honky tonk crowd
He picks them up when this world gets them down
All the smoke and the neon keep his pain here
Nobody knows The Honky Tonk Kid
Ten million fans and a hand full of friends
He'll go home alone when each night ends
He'll think about her and he'll twist off the lid
Cause nobody loves The Honky Tonk Kid
It won't be long the lord will take him away
But he'll draw a crowd just like he always did
My mountain is a mole hill
My throne's a busted chair
This crown has turn to rust
And it's all tangled in my hair
This high horse that I ride on
Is gonna buckle at the knee
Upon my castle made of sand
I cannot be the king of me
There's the man in white
His words are painted red
There's power in his blood
And only truth in what he said
There's the man in black
With a needle in his vein
This is the prayer that he once prayed
My throne's a busted chair
This crown has turn to rust
And it's all tangled in my hair
This high horse that I ride on
Is gonna buckle at the knee
On my castle made of sand
And this harem in my heart is filled
With hot metal and fool's gold
Watch your statue turns to dirt
All that's left in the end is your soul
With all your heart and soul
Though this cold world
My mountain is a mole hill
My throne's a busted chair
This crown has turn to rust
And it's all tangled in my hair
This high horse that I ride on
Is gonna buckle at the knee
Upon my castle made of sand
I cannot be the king of me
My mountain is a mole hill
My throne's a busted chair
This crown has turn to rust
And it's all tangled in my hair
This high horse that I ride on
Is gonna buckle at the knee
Upon my castle made of sand
I cannot be the king of me
River strong you can't swim inside it
We could string some lights up the hill beside it
Tonight the moon so bright you could drive with your headlights out
Cause a little bit of summers what the whole years all about
Girl you look fine fine fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say say say ain't this been some kinda day
You and me been catching on like some kinda wildfire
Don't get up just to get another
You can drink from mine
We can't leave each other
We can with the day you can rest your head on my shoulder if you wanna get older with me
Cause a little bit of summer makes a lot of history
Girl you look fine fine fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say say say ain't this been some kinda day
You and me been catching on like a wildfire
Girl you look fine fine fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say say say ain't this been some kinda day
You and me been catching on like a wildfire
Girl you look fine fine fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say say say baby ain't this the best of days
Right on track I'm chugging
Rolling like an old freight train. On a
Flying down the road running
Like an outlaws boys on the day
I know you're sound asleep at
Home while I'm on this stage. and I'm missing you
Wishing I was kissing you
Mighty lonesome sound when there's not soul around
Hear the gears grind full steam ahead halfway out of my mind
I'm too far gone to be turning back
I'm here and gone like yesterday
Rolling like an old freight train. just like an old freight train.
She keeps it all together
I always come unwound
She's cool calm and collected
I wanna paint the town
She's like a Sunday morning
She's like a stain glass window
That no one sees but me
That brings me to my knees
There's something about Sinatra
And a bottle of Chardonnay
Without a single word
She takes my breath away
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you
Right now that kind of look in her eyes
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look
She sparkles like a diamond
She twinkles like a star
She's like a ray of sunshine
That always melts my heart
And when I'm feeling empty
Her love makes me whole
Just like a country breeze
That soothes my weary soul
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you
Right now that kind of look in her eyes
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that
She's up to something
She's up to something
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you
Right now that kind of look in her eyes
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look
There's something about Sinatra

He wanted someone who loves the land as much as he does
Somebody simple and strong that he knows he can count on
That's why God loves cowboys
He knew they need room and freedom
He was there when he heard those prayers coming from shying
Right beside that young man on his last ride
That's why God loved cowboys
Ooh those cold nights get lonely
He needs more then just a good fire keeping him warm
Ooh there's nothing more holy
Than a love of a woman weather life storm
That's why God loves cowgirls
That's why God loves cowboys
First kiss I thought I died and gone to heaven
I went in to pay when I walked out
I know that's gonna leave a mark
Just like a tattoo on my heart
It's gonna tear my world apart
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark.
If you play with fire you're bound to get burned
You would think by now that I would've learned
My mama said don't but I did it anyway
I know that's gonna leave a mark
Just like a tattoo on my heart
It's gonna tear my world apart
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark.
I wish you didn't look so dang good
I wish you wouldn't smile at me that way if there's any
I know that's gonna leave a mark
Just like a tattoo on my heart
It's gonna tear my world apart
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark.
Don't you ever let this world push you around
Use your head and keep your feet firmly on the ground
And if you get knocked down
Get back up and try again
And don't you ever lose that sparkle in your eyes
Don't bottle up your passion like a jar fireflies
If you ever lose sight of your light
Don't you forget your faith in God above
Don't you forget your mom and daddy's love
Follow your heart and always believe in the underdog
Don't buy a thing unless you can pay in cash
Go ahead and throw those credit cards in the trash
If you're down in the count one strike away
Choke up and crowd the plate and put the ball in play
Keep your nose down when you win
Keep your head up when you lose
And you're gonna lose
Don't you forget your faith in God above
Don't you forget your mom and daddy's love
Follow your heart and always believe in the underdog
And there will come a day
So make me smile while we're apart
You gotta sing from you soul and play with all of your heart
There's a good chance your heart will break in two
Trust that God has someone special planned for you
Did you know I was down on love and luck
Someday you'll have babies of your own
The greatest honor that I've ever had
Is having you call me your dad
Don't forget your faith in God above
Don't you forget your mom and daddy's love
Follow your heart and always believe in the underdog
And you know you can't blame it on the breaks.
Blame it on those baby blues
Tailgate kind of summer night
Blame it on those baby blues
Yeah when the sun goes down on the sleepy little town
You turn my world into a country love song.
Take a good long look in the mirror
And you'll see what turns my radio on
Blame it on those baby blues
Tailgate kind of summer night
Blame it on those baby blues
Can't get enough of me
By the time the sunrise comes
You can blame it on those baby blues
Tailgate kind of summer night
Blame it on those baby blues
You can blame it on those baby blues
I've had one of those days
Girl I need you to be
My soft place to fall
So lay your pretty head on my side of the bed
I turn it on and on when I turn off those bedroom lights
Say you want me to stay
I've had one of those days
I long to hold you tight
Fine wine and candle light
Girl I need your touch to set me free
So lay your pretty head on my side of the bed
I turn it on and on when I turn off those bedroom lights
Say you want me to stay
I've had one of those days
Baby I need one of your nights
Girl we got that kinda romance
Remember that night on your street
I said Id sweep you off your feet
So lay your pretty head on my side of the bed
I turn it on and on when I turn off those bedroom lights
Say you want me to stay
I've had one of those days
Baby I need one of your nights
I've had one of those days
Sunday afternoon church potluck
George Jones blaring from my grandpa's truck
Granny's fried chicken and her sweet tea
Now that's a bittersweet memory
The old tire swing where my little boys play
Doing double back flips off the branch in the tank
Kissing on you and fishing from the bank
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times
That's a love made in the shade of our family tree
Passed down from my granny and my grandpa
But our roots were deep and our faith was strong
With every sunset comes another sunrise
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times
That's a love made in the shade of our family tree
Lost love once throughout the years
Remember their smiles and dry those tears
So let love grow like a country vine
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times
That's a love made in the shade of our family tree
Made in the shade of our family tree
Sunday afternoon church potluck
George Jones blaring from my grandpa's truck
A family that prays together
Is a family that stays together
Love the Lord thy God and Savior
With all your heart and love thy neighbor
A family that prays together
Is a family that stays together
Love the Lord thy God and Savior
I'm one of the boys that make sure nobody pays with their
Life ain't easy for a joker like me
I've got a smile painted on my face
It's only make believe
She's got me where she wants me
Got me blinking when they cover the gate
I'm afraid someone's gonna get hurt
I'm in love with the rodeo queen
A clown in love with the rodeo queen
Every night the crowd goes wild when they see her riding
How much time stands still when the bull starts spinning
When the bull starts spinning
When the bull starts spinning
She's got me where she wants me
Got me blinking when they cover the gate
I'm in love with the rodeo queen
A clown in love with the rodeo queen
I ain't just some fool in a barrel no
There's a real heart beating underneath my
I might look like it but I ain't a pretender
Got me blinking when they cover the gate
Got me blinking when they cover the gate
I'm in love with the rodeo queen
I can see you have a passion for the songs you write and play.
But you lack what we all call commercial appeal.
And you just don't have what it takes to make it here in Nashville.
Well my heart felt like a train wreck
But I wore a smile on my face.
And put my guitar back in its case.
Our little conversation was like a revelation redirecting my dreams
Cause God knows I'd never sell my soul to rock and roll or rap
Or wear those tight skinny jeans.
And I'm gonna sing what I wanna sing.
Rather be an old fence post in Texas than the king of Tennessee.
My old pick up truck and I drove back home to Amarillo.
Got a gig off old route 66 at this bar room called the Armadillo.
Not a sole showed up.
But I just kept on kicking that cup.
In just over 10 year.
I'd say I'm doing all right.
And I'm gonna sing what I wanna sing.
Rather be an old fence post in Texas than the king of Tennessee.
And I'm gonna sing what I wanna sing.
Rather be an old fence post in Texas than the king of Tennessee.
Then sell my soul to rock and roll or rap or wear those tight fitting
A sharp pain in my soul
No cars on the county road
I made some big mistakes
I can't take back yesterday
But its to hard to live this way
When your heart is a million miles away
I get tired and it makes me mean
But cruel words aren't what you need
And two hours on the interstate I get quite start to pray but it
Feels like I lost my faith
There's a sharp pain in my soul
No cars on the county road
What I give to change my faith
She came from the middle of nowhere
A sleepy Pennsylvania town
Her mother held her guilty for so long
Till she finally put those burdens down
He spent his whole life on city fair
His window played the evening sun
And it's hard to believe for a strong man
But he surely was a lonely one
She took the morning shift downtown
It's strange to be his favorite place
And after every single customer was cruel enough
He was the only one to smile and say
Thank you for the coffee
A simple conversation
Thank you for the light shining in your eyes
It's taken such a long time to find someone to talk to
And I know it ain't much
But thank you for your time
And it's hard to find a kindred soul
And people are so unkind
And little things drive you crazy
Stay locked away in your mind
Just like Romeo and Juliet
But time never listens to fairy tales
So love had met the bitter end
He went back to his city life
And Pennsylvania called her name
Someone with the time to say
Thank you for the coffee
A simple conversation
Thank you for the light shining in your eyes
It's taken such a long time to find someone to talk to
Girl I know it ain't much
Put down the cigarettes
Stay up and talk to me
There's nowhere to be tonight
So come in and lock the door
And I know I'm hard on you
I think you realize you're hard on me too
So when the going's tough
We can't put our weapons down
Cause this love's strong enough to stay around
They can't tear this fortress down
These people talk too much
And I'm a conversation piece
And I'm not a pay check
And you're more than trailer trash
And a power too big for us
Has kept me here with you
And I know I'm hard on you
And I think you realize you're hard on me too
So when the going's tough
We can't put our weapons down
Cause this love is strong enough to stay around
They can't tear this fortress down
You know that talk is cheap
I speak my heart in melody
And I'll use this song to say
I'm always hoping for a good time
Never happens on a Tuesday night
Two weeks and I'm hearing the same play
The same rhythm for most of my life
My hands hurting from the steel strings
5 hours and it never did bother me
I was the only one listening
I'm just glad there's someone like you I can come home to
I've spent my whole life searching for a road taking me everywhere
It's so hard when I'm never there
It takes everything to follow my heart
And sometimes I'm so afraid
I pull the brakes and stop the train
I know we're tired and lonely
Love is gonna pull us through
I know we're tired and lonely
Love's gonna pull us through
And I'm glad there's someone like you I can come home to
I'm always hoping for a good time
Never happens on a Tuesday night
Two weeks and I'm hearing the same play
The same rhythm for most of my life
My hands hurting from the steel strings
5 hours and it never did bother me
I was the only one listening
I'm just glad there's someone like you I can come home to
I've spent my whole life searching for a road taking me everywhere
It's so hard when I'm never there
It takes everything to follow my heart
And sometimes I'm so afraid
I pull the brakes and stop the train
I know we're tired and lonely
Love is gonna pull us through
I know we're tired and lonely
Love's gonna pull us through
And I'm glad there's someone like you I can come home to
A sharp pain in my soul
No cars on the county road
I made some big mistakes
I can't take back yesterday
But its to hard to live this way
When your heart is a million miles away
I get tired and it makes me mean
But cruel words aren't what you need
And two hours on the interstate I get quite start to pray but it
Feels like I lost my faith
There's a sharp pain in my soul
No cars on the county road
What I give to change my faith

Girl I know it ain't much
I saw you walk in here
With that guitar in your hand
I thought I might ask you
Just one more question
I used to have me a band
He got on down at the plant.
Our singer got a girlfriend
Well you know how that goes
Man if you want me to
I'll sing a song with you
I used to sing the high part
He plays a mean guitar
There's no need to call security.
That you'd sing a song for me.
Birmingham to Jackson
The sunshine on your bare feet
Your toenails painted hot pink
And running through the sprinkler
The song you're always singing
And the dawn is breaking
The old yellow moon is sinking
I run the truck up in the yard
And leave the keys swinging
Because 21 days has got me thinking
That 21 days is 22 days too long
Fayetteville to Little Rock
Shreveport to Beaumont
Labor Day was a fine mess
We just laughed it off when you kept it on
The song you're always singing
And the dawn is breaking
The old yellow moon is sinking
I run the truck up in the yard
And leave the keys swinging
Because 21 days has got me thinking
That 21 days is 22 days too long
The song you're always singing
And the dawn is breaking
The old yellow moon is sinking
I run the truck up in the yard
And leave the keys swinging
Because 21 days has got me thinking
That 21 days is 22 days too long
We shared a seat for two for the first time
You left me in a mystery
Shelly won't you call
Shelly won't you call
I hoped that I would hear from you
At least every week or two
And baby it hurts to know
Sometimes you got to let it go
When love runs out of time
It's been such a long time since my phone quit ringing
Guess I gotta let you go
Cause your sailing your ship and baby I'm sinking
My first show was at a dead end bar down on College Street
I was proud to play for nothing back when I was seventeen
I swore my dreams were over when I never played a second gig
Till I found out that the bar shut down for getting rich off of high school kids
A change never comes easy
A change never comes easy
Ten years have come and gone. Slipped out form under me
And now days I play my songs a long way from College Street
Everyday is a brand new place and sometimes I still play for free
It goes to show the good old days ain't as bad as they used to be
A change never comes easy
A change never comes easy
I guess I took it hard as anybody in my shoes
Live and learn hide the scars but don't let it get to you
A change never comes easy
A change never comes easy
A change never comes easy
There's a light in the city
Standing 5 miles high
I'm crossing that river
There's a girl on my mind
It's high atop the buildings
And It's just a one more reason
She's stuck in my head
And it buzzes like neon
And it makes me feel fine
And the way she leads me on
It's a real good sign
These dirty brick cities
They all look the same
There's something within
Says a change in the weather
Is coming round again
And it buzzes like neon
And it makes me feel fine
And the way she leads me on
It's a real good sign
From Lawrence to Springfield
There ain't nothing out there
Just hills and prairies
And this cold dry air
I'm starting to hear voices
Too far out to turn around
And it buzzes like neon
And it makes me feel fine
And the way she leads me on
It's a real good sign
And the way she leads me on
It's a real good sign
I sat on the front porch
Playing the same chords
And half my afternoon
I'm going to find a different groove
I've got a good friend
How does he do it this way
The boys got a rhythm
Gonna put my soul into music
And find a different groove
Everywhere under the sun
But I've made up my mind
I can't make it swing
On account of my two left feet
I've got to keep moving
And find a different groove
And find a different groove
There's a late night diner on the south side of town
That pretty girls on Friday should never hang around
But the lady two seats over is sitting there crying all alone
If she's here at this hour it must be hell on her at home
I'm not trying to know your business
I'm not trying to change your life
It costs a lot to love somebody
And I know because I had to pay the price
I finished up my coffee and put my dollar down to leave
But that'd be the bad decision that I made one too many times
I'm not trying to know your business
I'm not trying to change your life
It costs a lot to love somebody
And I know because I had to pay the price
It costs a lot to love somebody
The darkest hour is always before the dawn
And it sure is dark out here driving all alone
But it's sad to say I can't come home tonight
Because I'm down below the Mississippi line
Where the clouds are dancing in the full moon light
On the side of the road underneath the pines
There's a big arrow flashing my name on the sign
I tried to call you up and tell you so
Still I love you baby you know I'd never be untrue
Sometimes it gets so hard when you're on the move
When your down below the Mississippi line
Where the clouds are dancing in the full moon light
On the side of the road underneath the pines
There's a big arrow flashing my name on the sign
I'm down below the Mississippi line
Where the clouds are dancing in the full moon light
On the side of the road underneath the pines
There's a big arrow flashing my name on the sign
Everyone thinks I've lost my mind.
Can make it on every day of your life.
I guess she didn't even try to call.
I was getting sad tearing out the walls.
You're in a tough place moving day to day
Where nothing stays the same for any length of time
And you are so strong but I know the days get so long
Anticipating right and wrong and trying to choose a side
Where everybody says no one said this was easy
And all the teenage blues staring down at your shoes
We all have to learn to lose to know how winning feels
But in the aftermath there is a definite path
Where everybody says no one said this was easy
Where everybody says no one said this was easy
I don't know much more desolate than North Mississippi heading west
Three more days I'll turn around then I'll be Alabama bound
No postcards or pay telephones to help me through the night
Something as simple as calling home never seems to work out right
The hardest part of what I do is missing you
This poor coffee hotel bed a thousand songs say what's in my head
That don't mean it ain't true when it comes to me and you
No postcards or pay telephones to help me through the night
Something as simple as calling home never seems to work out right
The hardest part of what I do is missing you
You spend your married life living with a ghost
I spend every night missing little things the most
No postcards or pay telephones to help me through the night
Something as simple as calling home never seems to work out right
Old black and white movies on TV
Empty cans on the nightstand
Ashtray full of half smoked cigarettes
Picking out old songs on my guitar
I was born a rambling man
I'm about as lonesome as it gets
Come on baby give just a little
I can't do nothing when you're gone
This place couldn't be any colder
I need your head on my shoulder
Work tends to put so much distance
Between your loving arms and me
I believe I've had about enough
I'm too tired to drive to Birmingham
So meet me in Tennessee
We'll spend the morning making up
Come on baby give just a little
I can't do nothing when you're gone
This place couldn't be any colder
I need your head on my shoulder
My heart's been breaking way too long
Come on baby give just a little
I can't do nothing when you're gone
This place couldn't be any colder
I need your head on my shoulder
Old black and white movies on TV
The voices in my head try
The voices in my head feed
Don't you know they got a
Foot for you They got me
Chained in this room I'm
Stuck for eternity to
The voices in my head
Torture me tell wreck
The voices in my head
Beat me tell I go to bed
And I can take no more
Of this pain wont you please
The voices that I met
I just can't go to bed
The voices in my head
Torture me so I can't rest
The voices in my head
Beat me tell I go to bed
I'm stuck in the stuck
Give me something that
The work of the mysteries
Will be right for you
It's the nations I run too
Just give it a little
Of everything I know that I can run to
I'm flying solo I'm running
There's no need to interrupt
I'm flying my own thing
I'm flying solo I'm running
There's no need to interrupt
I have something to say to you
I've never dream to be in
I can't believe I'm rolling solo
Emotions are feeling very ill right now
I hope this helps you to open up
To a new and brighter day
I hear the sounds of the
Birds swinging and sway
There's a new thereafter
I found you in need of
The sun arise shining on
In the world today I'm passing home
The sun arise shining on
In the world today I'm passing home
Try your mentalist touch
I don't want to impose you
Let's not fall in that hole again
We never really made it any way
But you were always unhappy
Lately I've been quite lonely
And I thought maybe you'd be home tonight
Maybe we could just talk some
And maybe I could even stay the night
I don't wanna be a man who brings home every girl he can
I just want to have you back again
I just want to have you back again
But I just want to have you back again
And I don't wanna be the dude that only wants to see you nude
I just want to have you back again
I don't wanna be a man who brings home every girl he can
I just want to have you back again
Now here's a little story that I would like to tell
Because of 2 big wars it tried to unload
Will start with one big bomb from over the sea
So please take heed to what I have to say
Keep this thing from happening in that awful way
Will start with one big bomb from over the sea
So please take heed to what I have to say
Keep this thing from happening in that awful way
I guess they don't think I've got worries enough
Oh God have mercy on me
Every dollar I make goes for taxes and bills
Perhaps they've discovered the cure for my ills
Oh God have mercy on me
And with folks saying things will get worser than now
I'm scared half to death all the time anyhow
Though it's little I am and it's less than I'm worth
At least I'll be dust with the biggest on earth
Oh God have mercy on me
I woke up with her in my arms this morning
You always find the wrong times to come around to call
Tonight I lay here touching her sweet body
And the good familiar feeling I recall
I closed my eyes to kiss her your memory appeared
You always find the wrong times to come around to call
You've left your little boy and me
You say you're tired of staying home
And you can make it on your own
I thought this family was your life
Found in a Cosmo magazine
That little guy and I will find our way
We never really knew you anyway
And when he wants to know the when the where the why and how
The mama who should be at home is gone
I'll tell him just forget it son
Or was it just a year or two
The girl I thought had clipped her wings
Lived only in my boyish dreams
Someday they'll say your son looks just like you
But you'll never know if what they say is true
And when he wants to know the when the where the why and how
The mama who should be at home is gone
I'll tell him just forget it son
And when he wants to know the when the where the why and how
The mama who should be at home is gone
I'll tell him just forget it son
Daddy had a 1969 Ford and I was just bout ten years old
We would listen to Jones and Haggard on the radio
He sang these things I still care to a girl he used to know
I learned how to sing and shuffle my shoes
I may be ragged but I'm right
I've got five dollars and it's Saturday night
And every time daddy got a little bit tired
I learned how to sing and shuffle my shoes
Your hand is like a torch each time you touch me
The look in your eye pulls me apart
Don't open the door to Heaven if I can't come in
Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart
Your kiss is like a drink when I'm thirsty
Oh and I'm thirsty for you with all my heart
But don't love me then act as though we never kissed
Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart
Don't give me something that you might take away
To have you then loose you wouldn't be smart on my part
Don't open the door to Heaven if I can't come in
Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart
I go home and break out the good stuff
All the good love is waiting for me
Anything less than her ain't nearly enough love
So I go home and break out the good stuff
And when that loving feeling gets to me
There's just one place I wanna be
I go home and break out the good stuff
Anything less than her ain't nearly enough love
So I go home and break out the good stuff
I go home and break out the good stuff
Anything less than her ain't nearly enough love
Well you'd never know it
That she was the woman
That walked in with him
He danced every dance
While she watched from her chair
Like she wasn't there
Well she was a beauty
And I thought to myself
What a fool he must be
Well I watched and I waited
Till the time was just right
And I walked away with
The steal of the night
Like a thief I slipped in
Now I should feel guilty
We slipped out of sight
And I walked away with
The steal of the night
I'll do anything I can to keep our love together one more time
You made it hard for me to stay in line
When the sun goes down and the cat goes out
Last week you went to Vegas with your friends
And left me here alone
But it hurts when you don't call me when you're gone
See my mind begins to wander
And I'll find someone to take the hurt away
When the sun goes down and the cat goes out
When the sun goes down and the cat goes out
Your always so cold to me
We're falling apart right in front of my eyes
And it's something I just can't ignore
The love that we once knew
We're falling apart right in front of my eyes
And it's something I just can't ignore
They call me a playboy
As I'm making my rounds
Chasing the bright light
Of each night spot in town
My heart's breaking in two
They may call me a playboy
But I'm just lonesome for you
I once had a real love
That was when I had you
Now I'll never feel love
This false front I'm wearing
Is just to cover my blues
They may call me a playboy
But. I'm just lonesome for you
I once had a real love
That was when I had you
Now I'll never feel love
This false front I'm wearing
Is just to cover my blues
They may call me a playboy
But. I'm just lonesome for you
They may call me a playboy
As we listened to the Opera when I was just a kid.
My daddy talked through Saturday's them crazy things he did.
And the going thing was Texas swing before Bob Will's was king
Was in the town of Tulsa about 30 years ago
At Cain's Academy down in old Oklahoma
Well the dust was blowing but the music was right
We drove 80 miles through that blowing sand
Coming up them hill it just seized up on me
And I wouldn't miss a thing on Saturday night
I can hear that music in my ears
I was ready to go and I was shifting them gears
Knew she was my honey and she knew I was her man
And heard them pretty notes of that guitar ring
And The Light Crust Dough Boys and old Pappy Dan
At the time they were tough and money was tight
But I didn't care on Saturday night
Had no money but I could sang a blues
Was in the town of Tulsa by 30 years ago
At Cain's Academy down in the old Oklahoma
When the dust was blowing but music was right
From the girl who let you down
You would sell what is left of your soul
You keep telling yourself she means nothing
Maybe you should call her bluff
But if you don't really mean it
You must not be drinking enough.
You can buy down at the five and dime
But on some other woman
It don't smell the same in your mind.
You keep telling yourself you can take it
You tell yourself that you're tough
But if you still want to hold her
You must not be drinking enough.
To wash away old memories
And there ain't enough whiskey in Texas
It turns out you ain't quite so tough
You must not be drinking enough.
You heard this grown man cry
You must not be drinking enough.
You still wanna hold her
Love's a gamble every heart will take
You roll the dice in hopes that it won't break
One night I bet on your blue eyes and took a chance
And I won a whole lot more than one night of romance
I held the ace of hearts that night in the dark
How lucky can one man be
I hold a winning hand
Anyway life deals the cards
Love's a numbered wheel you have to spin
There's no need for me to spin again
Cause loving you is paying off more than I knew
I took a little risk and hit it big with you
I held the ace of hearts that night in the dark
How lucky can one man be
I hold a winning hand
Anyway life deals the cards
I held the ace of hearts that night in the dark
How lucky can one man be
I hold a winning hand
Anyway life deals the cards
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
She was raised uptown with a silver spoon
We had an old Ford tractor and a country moon
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
And I like my sushi southern fried
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
I need to place an ad with you today
Tomorrow may be too late
I'd like to have it started right away
I'm not buying or selling anything
I know just what to say
One good hearted woman
In the man that she loves
Just one chance to tell her
How much he still loves her
He can't be sorry enough
I just hope these few lines will get to her
I hope she comes back when she reads these words
One good hearted woman
In the man that she loves
Just one chance to tell her
How much he still loves her
He can't be sorry enough
He tuned it to a country show
To the crying of a steel guitar
Mama used to sing to me
She taught me that sweet harmony
I'd ever really take it this far
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
An atlas and a coffee cup
Five pickers and an old Dodge truck
For a show on Saturday night
It makes this thing I'm doing seem right
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
He won it thirty years ago
I made it up to music row
Still I wouldn't trade a minute
I wouldn't have it any other way
Just show me to the stage
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
Well she puts her dancing shoes on every night
And comes alive there in the smoke
Beneath them neon lights
Well she checks her broken heart there at the door
She's danced that dance before
Well I pity the next poor fool
That gets caught up in her rhythm
She's been on the losing end of love too many times
And she ain't gonna go for anything you've got in mind
So before you start let me impart
These few words of wisdom
She's been on the losing end of love too many times
And she ain't gonna go for anything you've got in mind
So before you start let me impart
These few words of wisdom
Has it been ten years
I've always heard marriage
Made one seem like two
But you're looking better
Than you did back then
You still make this old heart give in
And if I had it to do all over
I'd do it all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again
The preacher man said
That seemed like forever
To a young man's heart
Now the days seem much shorter
And the memories just keep adding up
And if I had it to do all over
I'd do it all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
Well I first kissed you on a hollow log
Down by the river they call the Dog
We fell in love and we vowed that day
Like the flow of the river our love won't change
On the bank of the river where the rock juts out
Now the river's still here but you're long gone
You left me and the river here all alone
I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you
I got the Dog River blues
Well the rain came down and the river rose up
Filled up the cab on my pickup truck
It came in the house and down the hall
And washed your picture right off the wall
I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you
I got the Dog River blues
And I pray someday it'll bring you home
If you change your mind honey I'll be here
I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you
I got the Dog River blues
I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you
I got the Dog River blues
For I still got the river but I ain't got you
In small town down in Georgia
Until she met that Jackson boy
They married young like folks did then
Not a penny to their name
They believed the one you vowed to love
Should always stay the same
And on the land his daddy gave him
A foundation underway
For a love to last forever
Or until their dying day
They built a bond that's strong enough
To stand the test a time
And a place for us to turn to
When our lives were in bind
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
And taught us right from wrong
In this world that I'll call home
My mama raised five children
She found her strength in faith of God
She never had a social life
Home was all she knew
Except the time she took a job
And my daddy skinned his knuckles
On the cars that he repaired
He never earned much money
But he gave us all he had
He never made the front page
But he did the best he could
Folks drove the cars from miles around
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
And taught us right from wrong
In this world that I'll call home
There'll never be another place
A heartache looking for a place to stay.
The Lord made a woman to make a man a fool.
There ain't no ending to what a man won't do.
It's a short sweet ride on a runaway train.
But I knew stone sober I was being used.
She took all she wanted and she was gone.
There ain't no ending to what a man won't do.
It's a short sweet ride on a runaway train.
There ain't no ending to what a man won't do.
It's a short sweet ride on a runaway train.
There ain't no ending to what a man won't do.
It's a short sweet ride on a runaway train.
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
For the Rolling Stones
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Before you drop that quarter
Keep one thing in mind
You got a heartbroke hillbilly
Standing here in line
I've been down and lonely
Before you punch that number
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
For the Rolling Stones
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Against rock and roll
But when your heart's been broken
You need a song that's slow
And don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear George Jones
For the Rolling Stones
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
I had to look through our old pictures
To see the way we used to smile
Before we left love in the closet
Like it just went out of style
Wipe the hurt away like dust
Make love shine the way it used to shine
Find the gold beneath the rust
That's all I need to know
Do you wanna stay together
Just say let's don't let go
Have the teardrops that you've cried
Drowned the fire in your eyes
Is there one flame beneath the smoke
Tell me is there any hope
That's all I need to know
Is it too late to recover
Those old smiles we used to wear
Can we save a love that once was strong
Before it breaks beyond repair
That's all I need to know
Do you wanna stay together
Just say let's don't let go
Have the teardrops that you've cried
Drowned the fire in your eyes
Is there one flame beneath the smoke
Tell me is there any hope
That's all I need to know
Is there one flame beneath the smoke
Tell me is there any hope
Dallas packed her suitcase
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her
She made leaving me look easy
I wish she'd made it look a little harder
I took her out of Texas
When she was just a girl
But old Tennessee and me
Couldn't take Texas out of her
On how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
If Dallas was in Tennessee
By now she's leaving Memphis
And everything we had behind her
Will serve as a reminder
That true love is a treasure
That's very seldom found
But you can't stay together if there's no common ground
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
If Dallas was in Tennessee
Dallas packed her suitcase
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
I called my doctor on the telephone
I can't eat and I can't sleep
I told my buddies I was settling down
They looked at me like I was a fool
I can't eat and I can't sleep
There ain't nothing I can do
I can't eat and I can't sleep
Sounds like love's got a hold on you
Sounds like love's got a hold on you
She looked me in the eye and said it's over
She said don't tell me lies and try to please me
I've heard it all so many times before
And I took her by the arm and said don't leave me
And somewhere deep inside me I still do
I've got the shades pulled down
I told everybody including my mama
But I've been right here
Since you've been gone
Listening to George Jones
Coming through the speakers of my stereo
Don't want to see nobody
I'm gonna hide my heart
And be a love recluse
Oh I could cry on my best friend's shoulder
But there ain't no use
The pain I'm going through
So I'll keep George on the old turntable
Coming through the speakers of my stereo
Don't want to see nobody
Smoke and candles burning low
Their backs to the bar
Staring across a crowded floor
Then I hear a familiar sound
Your voice laughing out loud
From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance
In a corner somewhere
But I can look at you
And I remember those times
When I looked in your eyes
The way that he now looks at you
Deep down I know it's over
But it hurts me when he's so much closer
From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance
And if I can't hold you near me
I'll just hold onto your memory
From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance
There's a lady living right above me
Pretty as a picture on the wall
Once I helped her with a bag of groceries
We met a time or two out in the hall
She told me somebody hurt her feelings
The hurt that's in her eyes is plain to see
Slowly she's been wearing out my ceiling
Back and forth I followed every footstep
A callused right hand
Holds a shiny gold watch
For thirty years spent on the clock
But you won't see no tears
He's always been hard as a rock
But he knows he's too old
Besides he just wouldn't know how
I guess he's just glad
But he's got to wonder what now
No statute carved out of stone
And his greatest reward is the love of a woman
That old working class hero lives on
Seems so much bigger today
With just him and mama
What he's done with his life
Might not be remembered
But he's got every right to be proud
No statute carved out of stone
And his greatest reward is the love of a woman
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught
Down by the river on a Friday night
Pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
The minute that she waltzed right through that door
Now she's with somebody new out on that floor
And she's got the rhythm and I got the blues
She's got the rhythm and I've got the blues
As she spells out regret in perfect time
She's got the rhythm and I got the blues
Our room was filled with silence
I guess we'd said it all
I don't know when I'd seen our bedroom
So long I can't recall
We'd built this thing between us
I'm not sure what's the cause
So I swallowed all my pride
And tonight I climbed the wall
Tonight I climbed the wall
And took her by the hand
We'd come too far to fall
Couldn't stand to see it end
So tonight I climbed the wall
When you love the one you hold
You'd think by now I'd know
Now as we lie here together
All our troubles seem so small
Just these satin sheets between us
Tonight I climbed the wall
And took her by the hand
We'd come too far to fall
Couldn't stand to see it end
So tonight I climbed the wall
Tonight I climbed the wall
She makes me moan all night long
So I don't need the booze to get a buzz on
I've tried it all from Tennessee Whiskey
To Ozark Mountain Moonshine
But it's her sweet love that packs the punch
And keeps me higher than a Georgia pine
My Southern Comfort don't come in a bottle
I get a double shot of love homegrown
So I don't need the booze to get a buzz on
My little country girl makes my head whirl and my knees begin to shake
Yeah I'm hooked on my baby's love
There ain't nothing in a jug this strong
So I don't need the booze to get a buzz on
I've tried it all from Tennessee Whiskey
To Ozark Mountain Moonshine
But it's her sweet love that packs the punch
And keeps me higher than a Georgia pine
My Southern Comfort don't come in a bottle
I get a double shot of love homegrown
So I don't need the booze to get a buzz on
I wear a Blue Ribbon grin every now and then
But I don't need that to get stoned
No I don't need the booze to get a buzz on
There's one lonely pillow on my double bed
My room's decorated with pictures of you
Your letters wallpaper this shrine to the blues
I've got precious memories at my beck and call
I've got everything a broken heart needs
I've got everything a broken heart needs
Now I'm up to my ears in tears
Up to my ears in tears
Well I found some old love letters you wrote me years ago
But the words all ran together when the tears began to flow
If I can't wash away your memory guess I'll just go under slow
Up to my ears in tears
Yeah I'm up to my ears in tears
Up to my ears in tears
Yeah that water's cold and clear
I thought some time in the sun
Would help me get over you
But I could tell from day one
This is a place meant for two
Now here I sit on the beach
Watching the tide ebb and flow
I booked my room for a week
But now I'm ready to go
I'm in a tropical depression
I've got the blue water blues
Can't shake this loving you obsession
Can't stand this sand in my shoes
This forgetting you vacation
Is just a fool's holiday
If I can't get over you
This tropical depression is gonna
This should be paradise
Heaven down by the sea
Without you here by my side
It feels like hell to me
I'm in a tropical depression
I've got the blue water blues
Can't shake this loving you obsession
Can't stand this sand in my shoes
This forgetting you vacation
Is just a fool's holiday
If I can't get over you
This tropical depression is gonna
If I can't get over you
This tropical depression is gonna
I got my first motorcycle when I turned sixteen
I got my own reasons why I do what I do
I like to ride motorcycles
I like to ride motorcycles
I always wore my hair just a little too long
Daddy didn't like it and he made no bones
If I'd have gotten it cut like he wanted me to
I got my own reasons why I do what I do
I like to wear my hair long
I like to wear my hair long
I got my own reasons why I do what I do
Now I got a big Harley
And my hair is still long
And I'm still listening to a country song
Yeah I know what I like
Well I guess it's just not my day
The wind blew my morning paper away
Then I cut my toe on a sliver of glass
If it ain't one thing it's you
If you've heard that I'm going crazy
The wheels seem to fall off whatever I do
If it ain't one thing
Well I rented that movie you hate
But that old VCR just chewed up the tape
Then I went to the freezer thought I'd cook me a steak
All I found was that old piece of our wedding cake
If it ain't one thing it's you
If you've heard that I'm going crazy
The wheels seem to fall off whatever I do
If it ain't one thing
But I never knew that I needed you so
If it ain't one thing oh it's you
If you've heard that I'm going crazy
The wheels seem to fall off whatever I do
If it ain't one thing
Oh if it ain't one thing
I'd tell you what I'd do
I go downtown buy a Mercury or two
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
I stole her from a friend
He got lucky stole her back again
She heard he had a Mercury
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
Well my baby went out
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
I'd tell you what I'd do
I go downtown buy a Mercury or two
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
Pretty Paper is playing on the jukebox
And mistletoe is hanging above the bar
I want to thank you for this
Broken heart that I got
Wherever in the world you are.
It's going to be a honky tonk Christmas
For these silent nights at home are killing me
It's going to be a honky tonk Christmas
But I'll be over you by New Year's Eve.
Blue Christmas turn it up I wanna hear it
If I make it through December I'll be fine.
It's going to be a honky tonk Christmas
For these silent nights at home are killing me
It's going to be a honky tonk Christmas
But I'll be over you by New Year's Eve.
Following a distant star
Not being sure of what it meant
But knowing it was Heaven sent
And didn't make a sound
And the Angels cried.
The angels knew what was to come
The reason god has sent his son from up above
It filled their hearts with joy to see
And knowing of his destiny
And didn't make a sound
And the Angels cried.
I've often thought about that night
And wondered if they realized that star so bright
Was sent to tell all of the land the son of god
Would soon become the son of man.
And didn't make a sound
And the Angels cried.
And the Angels cried.
If we make it through December
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town
Maybe even California
If we make it through December
Got laid off down at the factory
And their timing's not the greatest
Heaven knows I've been working hard
Wanted Christmas to be right
I don't mean to hate December
It's meant to be this happy time of year
And my little girl don't understand
Why daddy can't afford no Christmas here
If we make it through December
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town
Maybe even California
If we make it through December
Well I'm making out my list
But I'm afraid what I want this year
But Santa he's the kind
When he makes up his mind
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry
He can't see where he's going
If there tears in his eyes
And don't you know his ho ho ho will be
So baby come back to me
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry
And don't you know his ho ho ho will be
So baby come home to me
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry
So baby come back to me
The snow is falling It's Christmas Eve
Presents are wrapped Under the tree
I don't need nothing else
I ain't gonna write no letter Send north to the pole
Oh pick it Rudolph Go about it Frosty
I don't need nothing else
So put on your Christmas stockings I'll find that mistletoe
Let's get into the the holiday spirits
And honey ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
I don't need nothing else
I don't need nothing else
Today I took some paper from the closet
And wrapped the wedding ring
And I addressed it to the man
Who vowed to love you
And on the little card
I wrote these words inside
Merry Christmas to me
Just one gift beneath my tree
For the fool who let you leave
Merry Christmas to me
Then I sat down in my chair
And thought about you
About the many reasons why you're gone
And I opened up the present that I gave to me
And realized how much it hurts to be alone
Merry Christmas to me
Just one gift beneath my tree
For the fool who let you leave
Merry Christmas to me
I'm the fool who let you leave
Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
We're looking for the King
We're following the star
Old man won't you help us if you can
But he pointed his hand
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
There's a new kid in town
I see you've traveled far
You say these gifts are for
The new King's pleasure
That a King might come
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
There's a new kid in town
Well I've been sorta worried
About Santa Claus this year
And it didn't snow down here
But I'm telling you not to worry
Everybody listen closely
And I'll tell you what I heard
Instead of his trusty sleigh
He'll have a truck instead of reindeer
To carry him on his way
He couldn't get snow you see
Santa's gonna come in a pickup truck
When he visits you and me
Santa can't bring his reindeer
He'll leave them far away
He's gonna be here Christmas day
He's got a big red pickup
And there's gonna be a Merry Christmas
A Merry Christmas for all
Instead of his trusty sleigh
He'll have a truck instead of reindeer
To carry him on his way
He couldn't get snow you see
Santa's gonna come in a pick up truck
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry
Just last year when I was only seven
You came home a quarter past eleven
And fell down underneath our Christmas tree
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry
Mama smiled and looked outside the window
She told me son you better go upstairs
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nations
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Two young people without a thing
Say some vows and spread their wings
And settle down with just what they need
She just likes the way he smiles
It takes more than marble and tile
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Two old people without a thing
Children gone but still they sing
Side by side on that front porch swing
She can barely sweep the floor
Hand in hand they'll walk through that door
It doesn't take much when you get enough
It doesn't take much when you get enough
There's a hole in the wall
Where a nail used to be
A nail that held a picture of
The one that once held me
What I don't wanna hear
Oh I guess a saner man
Would simply paint it
But I'm not sane and after all
I've got this hammer in my hand
There'll be a hole in that wall
Big enough to drive a truck through
When you lose the greatest love
A little hole in the wall
Is enough to drive you mad
Oh I guess a saner man
Would simply paint it
But I'm not sane and after all
I've got this hammer in my hand
There'll be a hole in that wall
Big enough to drive a truck through
Oh I've got this hammer in my hand
There'll be a hole in that wall
Every night she looks in the mirror and she only ages
So she packs her bags to try her hand
But the bills are piling up and the pop scene just ain't on the rally
Be back in the money in no time at all
Everybody's gone country
And the way I talk sometimes
But you hate it most when I don't call at night
And it's just because you love me
You do the best you can with who I am
Can leave one in the dark
And I know what I put you through
Is hard upon your heart
And it's just that you're concerned for me
You do the best you can with who I am
You go to church on Sunday
While I'm still home in bed
And sometimes you say I'm perfect
And sometimes not worth a damn
You do the best you can with who I am
Can leave one in the dark
And I know what I put you through
Is hard upon your heart
And it's just that you're concerned for me
You do the best you can with who I am
You say you're heart's been broken
And you just can't win
You say that you'll never find love again
Let me tell you friend
You can't give up on love
That's the one thing we've got to keep going
Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
But you can't give up on love
It's another broken family
You can't give up on love
That's the one thing we've got to keep going
Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
But you can't give up on love
Troubled times make it hard to stay
So many lovers take the easy way
But don't go crazy and jump ship too soon
You can't give up on love
That's the one thing we've got to keep going
Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
But you can't give up on love
No you can't give up on love
Well I was sitting in a roadhouse down on Highway 41
You were wiping off some ketchup on a table that was done
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
And I asked you for a date and then I asked to tie the knot
And I finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car
The last thing I remember I heard myself say
I've never been too good with all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
Standing by a woman in a long white lacy veil
I raised the veil and she smiled at me without her left front tooth
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
I never thought my love life would quite turn out this way
Well I don't drink as much as I used to
And the hard times don't hurt like they ought to
And somehow I've learned how to listen
For a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground
And the midsummer days sit so heavy
But don't they flow like the breeze through your mind
When nothing appears in a hurry
To make up for someone's lost time
And somehow I've learned how to listen
For a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground
And somehow I've learned how to listen
For a sound like the breeze dying down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for the friend I have found
She keeps my feet on the ground
On the wrong end of the highway
When the long night has no end
When there's no one there beside me
Thank God for the radio
When I'm far from home
Thank God for the radio
That mean so much to me and you
There's a song that we first danced to
And there's a song they played the night we met
And there's a song we first made love to
That's a song I'll never forget
Thank God for the radio
When I'm far from home
Thank God for the radio
That mean so much to me and you
Thank God for the radio
When I'm far from home
Thank God for the radio
That mean so much to me and you
That mean so much to me and you
I work a forty hour week and I earn my keep
And I try to walk proud and tall
And I don't back up at all
There ain't nothing down home that I really don't enjoy
I drive a pickup truck and I don't pass the buck
And I always speak my mind
And I know how to have a good time
I'm a little bit rowdy and a little bit tame
Ain't no way I'm ever gonna change
There ain't nothing down home that I really don't enjoy
Well I must admit that I've mellowed a bit
Father Time can slow you down
It just takes a little longer now
There ain't nothing down home that I really don't enjoy
I'm just a country boy
Well I know sometimes you find it hard
To understand just what we do out here
Well that bus rolls up at home
And I sure don't like to leave you
Couldn't stand for you to think that I don't care
So I wrote this job description
Just to tell you what I do when I'm not there
I sleep eighty miles an hour
To the whining of a diesel down the interstate
The easy chair that sits beside the fireplace
Then we shut her down in another town
Shower up and do just what we came to do
Count the money and the miles back home to you
Well each night I take the stage
With a six piece band and a guitar in my hand
All the good times and the bad
Then we say goodbye and we load it up
And head somewhere I've already been
Then I lay down in that double bed alone
And I thank the Lord again
I sleep eighty miles an hour
To the whining of a diesel down the interstate
The easy chair that sits beside the fireplace
Then we shut her down in another town
Shower up and do just what we came to do
Count the money and the miles back home to you
Well I just sing for the people
This time I'd be true
I'd walk that straight line
There'd be no bad times
I make the worst mistake
One fool could ever make
Tell me it's not to late
If I could hold you tight
I'd have the world tonight
Everything would be alright
I make the worst mistake
One fool could ever make
Tell me it's not to late
If I could hold you tight
I'd have the world tonight
Everything would be alright
Everything would be alright
I'm always on the road
You're always all alone
And I'm not always there when I'm at home
But I'm ready for a little change
I'm ready to accept some blame
So let's back up to yesterday
Let's get back in love
All those little things we used to do
When all we had was enough
Well I don't like the blues
I like love that's true
Let's get back in love
All those little things we used to do
Let's get back in love
All those little things we used to do
Let's get back in love
All those little things we used to do
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught
Down by the river on a Friday night
Pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
Every night she looks in the mirror and she only ages
So she packs her bags to try her hand
But the bills are piling up and the pop scene just ain't on the rally
Be back in the money in no time at all
Everybody's gone country
The minute that she waltzed right through that door
Now she's with somebody new out on that floor
And she's got the rhythm and I got the blues
She's got the rhythm and I've got the blues
As she spells out regret in perfect time
She's got the rhythm and I got the blues
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
If you wanna drive a big limousine
I'll buy the longest one you've ever seen
If you wanna own a great big mansion
Well I'll give it my utmost attention
It may take a while but I'll prove that it's true
If it's money you want then I'll get it
If you wanna take a trip across the ocean
I'll travel anywhere you take a notion
If you wanna own a great big mansion
It may take a while but I'll prove it's true
If it's money you want then I'll get it
He tuned it to a country show
To the crying of a steel guitar
Mama used to sing to me
She taught me that sweet harmony
I'd ever really take it this far
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
An atlas and a coffee cup
Five pickers and an old Dodge truck
For a show on Saturday night
It makes this thing I'm doing seem right
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
He won it thirty years ago
I made it up to music row
Still I wouldn't trade a minute
I wouldn't have it any other way
Just show me to the stage
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
I'll take the sunshine over the rain
But I can swear that in every way that
But I will give you all that I am
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
For the Rolling Stones
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Before you drop that quarter
Keep one thing in mind
You got a heartbroke hillbilly
Standing here in line
I've been down and lonely
Before you punch that number
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
For the Rolling Stones
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Against rock and roll
But when your heart's been broken
You need a song that's slow
And don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear George Jones
For the Rolling Stones
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Two young people without a thing
Say some vows and spread their wings
And settle down with just what they need
She just likes the way he smiles
It takes more than marble and tile
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Two old people without a thing
Children gone but still they sing
Side by side on that front porch swing
She can barely sweep the floor
Hand in hand they'll walk through that door
It doesn't take much when you get enough
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nations
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
I called my doctor on the telephone
I can't eat and I can't sleep
I told my buddies I was settling down
They looked at me like I was a fool
I can't eat and I can't sleep
There ain't nothing I can do
I can't eat and I can't sleep
Sounds like love's got a hold on you
Sounds like love's got a hold on you
There's one lonely pillow on my double bed
My room's decorated with pictures of you
Your letters wallpaper this shrine to the blues
I've got precious memories at my beck and call
I've got everything a broken heart needs
I've got everything a broken heart needs
In small town down in Georgia
Until she met that Jackson boy
They married young like folks did then
Not a penny to their name
They believed the one you vowed to love
Should always stay the same
And on the land his daddy gave him
A foundation underway
For a love to last forever
Or until their dying day
They built a bond that's strong enough
To stand the test a time
And a place for us to turn to
When our lives were in bind
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
And taught us right from wrong
In this world that I'll call home
My mama raised five children
She found her strength in faith of God
She never had a social life
Home was all she knew
Except the time she took a job
And my daddy skinned his knuckles
On the cars that he repaired
He never earned much money
But he gave us all he had
He never made the front page
But he did the best he could
Folks drove the cars from miles around
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
And taught us right from wrong
In this world that I'll call home
There'll never be another place
I need to place an ad with you today
Tomorrow may be too late
I'd like to have it started right away
I'm not buying or selling anything
I know just what to say
One good hearted woman
In the man that she loves
Just one chance to tell her
How much he still loves her
He can't be sorry enough
I just hope these few lines will get to her
I hope she comes back when she reads these words
One good hearted woman
In the man that she loves
Just one chance to tell her
How much he still loves her
He can't be sorry enough
Well I was sitting in a roadhouse down on Highway 41
You were wiping off some ketchup on a table that was done
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
And I asked you for a date and then I asked to tie the knot
And I finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car
The last thing I remember I heard myself say
I've never been too good with all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
Standing by a woman in a long white lacy veil
I raised the veil and she smiled at me without her left front tooth
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
I never thought my love life would quite turn out this way
Dallas packed her suitcase
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her
She made leaving me look easy
I wish she'd made it look a little harder
I took her out of Texas
When she was just a girl
But old Tennessee and me
Couldn't take Texas out of her
On how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
If Dallas was in Tennessee
By now she's leaving Memphis
And everything we had behind her
Will serve as a reminder
That true love is a treasure
That's very seldom found
But you can't stay together if there's no common ground
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
If Dallas was in Tennessee
Dallas packed her suitcase
She looked me in the eye and said it's over
She said don't tell me lies and try to please me
I've heard it all so many times before
And I took her by the arm and said don't leave me
And somewhere deep inside me I still do
I'd tell you what I'd do
I go downtown buy a Mercury or two
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
I stole her from a friend
He got lucky stole her back again
She heard he had a Mercury
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
Well my baby went out
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
I'd tell you what I'd do
I go downtown buy a Mercury or two
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
Has it been ten years
I've always heard marriage
Made one seem like two
But you're looking better
Than you did back then
You still make this old heart give in
And if I had it to do all over
I'd do it all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again
The preacher man said
That seemed like forever
To a young man's heart
Now the days seem much shorter
And the memories just keep adding up
And if I had it to do all over
I'd do it all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
Have a little love on a little honeymoon
You got a little dish and you got a little spoon
A little bitty house and a little bitty yard
A little bitty dog and a little bitty car
A little hometown or a big old city
Life goes on for a little bitty while
A little bitty baby in a little bitty gown
It'll grow up in a little bitty town
A big yellow bus and little bitty books
It all started with a little bitty look
A little hometown or a big old city
Life goes on for a little bitty while
You know you got a job and a little bitty check
A six pack of beer and television set
Little bitty world goes around and around
Little bit of silence and a little bit of sound
Start all over in a little bitty world
Little bitty plan and a little bitty dream
It's all part of a little bitty scheme
It's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Life goes on for a little bitty while
It's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Life goes on for a little bitty while
Coffee keeps me up and I can't sleep
And when I drink too much then I can't eat
Losing you has led me to believe
Everything I love gonna have to give up
I guess I made a big mistake
Everything I love gonna have to give up
Everything I love gonna have to give up
How long will I love you
I'd like to think forever
Is how far we could go
So let me paint a picture
The day you don't mean everything to me
When a nickel's worth a dollar
And gold ain't worth a dime
When they build a ship on waters that will take you back in time
When the stars have all been counted
Now you don't have to worry
About what comes to pass
This old world may wear out
But my love's gonna last
If they ever build that highway to the moon
I'll just find something else to promise you
When a nickel's worth a dollar
And gold ain't worth a dime
When they build a ship on waters that will take you back in time
When the stars have all been counted
Oh when the stars have all be counted
This world can take you by the hand
And tempt the soul of any man
But you can choose your path
There's two roads you can take
One way is right and one way is wrong
And she's all I see between the devil and me
But through the smoke I see her there
She's all I see between the devil and me
I hold her in my arms tonight
So safe and warm I close my eyes
Outside her reach is my concern
Somewhere I know a fire burns
And she's all I see between the devil and me
But through the smoke I see her there
She's all I see between the devil and me
The gates of hell swing open wide
Well I just looked where I don't see
Like some big black widow spider
You know just how to catch your prey
And you sneak up from behind and whisper my name
And there go the words I meant to say
There go the games I wanted to play
You like to see what you can do
And there go the words I meant to say
There go the games I wanted to play
We still wear our rings
We still say I love you
We both play the part oh so well
It's like living in a house with no curtains
The whole world can see what's inside
You can turn out the lights in a house with no curtains
But heartache has nowhere to hide
We could pack up and leave in different directions
If we just had somewhere to go
We just keep on pretending
Admitting what everyone knows
It's like living in a house with no curtains
The whole world can see what's inside
You can turn out the lights in a house with no curtains
But heartache has nowhere to hide
You can turn out the lights
In a house with no curtains
On the trouble of a woman and a man
But you can not impose
You can't stick your nose
Into something that you don't understand
And who don't even care anymore
And who's car is parked next door
I thought I knew her well
I really couldn't tell
That she had another lover on her mind
You see it felt so right
When she held me tight
How could I be so blind
And who don't even care anymore
Who's car is parked next door
A heart is on the line
Love is stolen in the shadows of the night
Though it's wrong all along
Who don't even care anymore
Who's car is parked next door
And who don't even care anymore
Who's car is parked next door
And who don't even care anymore
After seventeen years behind bars
He sat down and poured out his heart
When his son came to see him today
He spoke with a voice that trembled
He said I ain't been much of a father
And the water is deep
Or you'll end up like me
And walk on the rocks that I stumbled on
He said son stay away from the bottle
Watch out for the company you keep
And hold on to those you love
The right way may not be easy
The right road ain't always straight
That lead to where I am today
And the water is deep
Or you'll end up like me
And walk on the rocks that I stumbled on
Well I must've had a ball last night
I can't recall what even started our fight
I must've drank away my blues
Well I must've done the town up right
I must've had a ball last night
And someone's in the kitchen sink
Well I must've had a ball last night
I can't recall what even started out fight
Well I must've drank away my blues
Well I must've done the town up right
I must've had a ball last night
Well my picture's on the table
Somebody tore it right in two
Well who'd do such a crazy thing
Someone took your suitcase and your little car
I can't recall what even started out fight
I must've drank away my blues
Well I must've done the town up right
I must've had a ball last night
Well I must've done the town up right
There ain't no way of knowing
But all the signs are showing
I must've had a ball last night
Well I've been on the wrong side
Of the front door too often
Watched you slam it in my face
Well I may have learned the hard way
Won't even have to try
And a chance for you to cry
I've stood behind you
And I've laid beside you
But I won't do that anymore
Just here when you want me
Won't even have to try
And a chance for you to cry
Let's begin with the day I met her
How fast this good old boys world got better
Just the first few seconds after I first seen her
My best old jeans and my broken sneakers
Sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
She's the best cook that's ever melted cheese
There's absolutely no reason to doubt it
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
Here I am alone again tonight
In this old empty house
Its hard to learn what you don't think you need
That you can't live without
Never leave the sound of the telephone
But ever since you left
I've asked myself the reasons
Going up and down this hall way
Trying to leave the pain behind
Never saw your face this many times
When you were really here
Things you said I never understood
Never spent this much time alone
But ever since you left
I've asked myself the reasons
Going up and down this hall way
Trying to leave the pain behind
They ware the little man
I go back now and the stores are empty
Except for an old coke sign dated 1950
Boarded up like they never existed
Or renovated and called historic districts
There goes the little man
There goes the little man
Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
And killed the little man
He pumped your gas and he cleaned your glass
And one cold rainy night he fixed your flat
The new stores came where you do it yourself
You buy a lotto ticket and food off the shelf
Forget the little man
Forget about that little man
He hung on there for a few more years
And he wouldn't sell beer
Now the bank rents the station
To a man down the road
And they sell velvet Elvis and
There goes little man
There goes another little man
Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
And killed the little man
Now the stores are lined up in a concrete strip
You can buy the whole world in just one trip
They don't even realize
Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
And killed the little man
It wasn't long ago when I was a child
An old black man came with his mule and his plow
He broke the ground where we grew our garden
Long live the little man
Looking through these old photographs
Don't they bring good memories back
Some of them make us laugh
I'm glad we've kept all of these souvenirs
To prove that our love was here
Look at how happy we were
If forever should end today
And there's no tomorrow for us
What a day yesterday was
Here's one of us with you calm and cool
But look at me acting a fool
And here's one of us on the ferris wheel
The best may be yet to come
We may have a hundred years
If forever should end today
And there's no tomorrow for us
What a day yesterday was
Let's close this book of photographs
And let's turn out the lights
And love for the moment
As if it were the last
If forever should end today
And there's no tomorrow for us
What a day yesterday was
I've tried so hard to make love happen
I end up on the sad side of the fun
They've got someone and love looks great
I've tried it wild and tried it proper
I've gotten used to getting over
And hopefully as I grow older
Love won't be so difficult to see
When I look into your soft green eyes
When I see your delicate body
Revealed to me as you slip off your dress
I'm reminded what I feel for you
Will remain strong and true
Long after the pleasures of the flesh
Then I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
Be it the wind or the rain
Or the moon up in the sky
The spin of the earth or the changes in the tide
I don't know what brought us together
What strange forces of nature
Conspire to construct the present
Then I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
When I look into your soft green eyes
When I see your delicate body
Revealed to me as you slip off your dress
I'm reminded what I feel for you
Will remain strong and true
Long after the pleasures of the flesh
Then I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
I woke up the other night
I've never seen before
She said my name's Juliet
That's another good reason not to drink
That's another good reason not to drink
When I'm sober I'm almost a saint
If I keep going on like this
That's another good reason not to drink
I can't go see my best friend
Just because of what I said
That's another good reason not to drink
That's another good reason not to drink
When I'm sober I'm almost a saint
If I keep going on like this
That's another good reason not to drink
I'm gonna sue the city
Last night as I left the bar
He stepped right on my hand
That's another good reason not to drink
That's another good reason not to drink
When I'm sober I'm almost a saint
If I keep going on like this
That's another good reason not to drink
That's another good reason not to drink
When I'm sober I'm almost a saint
If I keep going on like this
That's another good reason
Baby let me in I'm freezing
I'll never understand
All the little things
I'll never come Face to face
You know a girl can't be too careful with her heart
But I saw you and thought that you looked harmless
But when you smile that way I'm not so sure you are
You can tell that by the way I move
When I saw you I thought that it was hopeless
But I just had to ask you for a dance or two
Somewhere in the stars it must be written
If there's a heaven here on earth I think we've found it
The music stopped and we're still holding each other
This feels like the beginning of forever
Somewhere in the stars it must be written
Girl we've got to take this chance that we've been given
If there's a heaven here on earth I think we've found it
You always told me that you wanted to
I guess I never thought It would happen
I guess I never really wanted it to
The world is calling you and you must answer
But you can take me with you In your dreams
If you ever get back to Amarillo
In a shiny new car or worn out shoes
If you ever get back to Amarillo
At some office out in tinsel town
Don't forget about those who love you
They'll be there for you if you get down
I believe in you and all you're after
I hope you end up where you want to be
If you ever get back to Amarillo
In a shiny new car or worn out shoes
If you ever get back to Amarillo
Thirty years now have gone by quickly
I still think of you from time to time
I'm happy and my health is fine
I often wondered if you found your freedom
I sometimes wonder if I should have gone
If you ever get back to Amarillo
In a shiny new car or worn out shoes
If you ever get back to Amarillo
If you ever get back to Amarillo
In a shiny new car or worn out shoes
If you ever get back to Amarillo
I'll be waiting for you.
I've just got time for one more round
And you can let some other fool sit down
I'd like for you'd to listen to
Did you ever hear of a clown with tear
I think I'll have another round
And you can let some other fool sit down
Home for me is misery
And here I'm wasting time
Is not what's on my mind
But then you see her leaving me
It's not what I prefer
I think I'll have another round
And you can let some other fool sit down
When the last breath of life is gone from my body
And my lips are as cold as the sea
When my friends gather around for my farewell party
Won't you pretend you love me
There will be flowers from those who cry when I go
And leave you in this old world alone
I know you'll have fun at my farewell party
I know you'll be glad when I'm gone
Don't be mad at me for wanting to keep you
Till my life on this old world is through
You'll be free at the end of my farewell party
But I'll go away loving you
There will be flowers from those who cry when I go
And leave you in this old world alone
I know you'll have fun at my farewell party
I know you'll be glad when I'm gone
Whenever a chance to meet
Some old friends on the street
They wonder how does a man
I always got a smiling face
Any time and any place
And every time they ask me why
And let her know you think
About her when you're gone
And love her like the devil
When you get back home
Now people may try to guess
The secret of happiness
Some of them never learn
The secret I'm speaking of
Is a woman and a man in love
And let her know you think
About her when you're gone
And love her like the devil
When you get back home
And let her know you think
About her when you're gone
And love her like the devil
You know it don't take long
Till like two people in a heartbreak song
Well ain't it just like a woman
And ain't it just like a man
When it's right in the palm of your hand
When it's right in the palm of your hand
Can't take back those things we said
So we watch it pass in separate beds
Changing... were changing
Too little love and too much pride
You won't give in and neither will I
Like children ... children
Well ain't it just like a woman
And ain't it just like a man
Chasing the rainbow and looking for love
When it's right in the palm of your hand
When it's right in the palm of your hand
Feet on the floor holding my head
Sitting alone on the side of the bed
I've been thinking ... thinking
Trying to find where we went wrong
I just turned around and you were gone
It's over... it's over
Well ain't it just like a woman
And ain't it just like a man
Chasing the rainbow and looking for love
When it's right in the palm of your hand
And Ain't it just like a woman
And ain't it just like a man
Chasing the rainbow and looking for love
When it's right in the palm of your hand
Hey baby you ain't got to prove to me you're some kind of macho man
To check up on a moonshine still
When I got there to my surprise
I could see a little light on the hill
I was really hot on the track
I got a badge in my pocket
Better never make a slip
As I looked down the river
I noticed on the side of the hill
I can see a red light that was glowing bright
I knew it had to be a still
But I better know someone
I got a badge in my pocket
Them moonshiners better never make a slip
Must've knew I was on my way
And they started to scatter
I heard two or three of them say
He's got a big 45 and loads to fill
Dragging and shagging to another hill
And he'll get us if he can
Good dogs and all kinds of cats.
I'll stand right here where I'm at
Two kinds of babies to hold.
Two kinds of mothers I'm told I'm told
Good dogs and all kinds of cats.
Dirt roads and white lines and all kinds of stop signs
I'll stand right here where I'm at
Two kinds of babies to hold
Two kinds of mothers I'm told I'm told
Good dogs and all kinds of cats.
I'll stand right here where I'm at
I've never had any reason to doubt her
As far as I know she's been true
But lately she's had a different look in her eyes
When there's a world of people out there
I tell ya lately frankly I've been scared
But she's the only one I love
She still tells me she loves me
But I wonder if my love's enough
With a bamboo cane stuck in the sand
First I get cold and hot
There's nothing I can do
All that I want is you
Look what I'm going through
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
Something is wrong or right
I think of you all night
Seeing you in my dreams
Holding you close to me
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
I'm so glad to have you back within these arms of mine
I can finally go to sleep and get some rest
Never once did I think of finding someone new
You're the very thing they sing about in love songs
And one mistake don't mean you've failed the test
And I think the world should know
I don't care what you've said or done
I'll always love you so
And I think the world should know
I don't care what you've said or done
I'll always love you so
All of those tourists covered in oil
On my front porch swing
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's nobody's fault
I don't know the reason
I stayed here all season
But it's a real beauty
How it got here I haven't a clue
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
Must be Buffet's fault
Broke my leg twice I had to limp on back home
But there's booze in the blender
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know this is all Alan's fault
Yes and some people claim that there's a woman to blame
Football games on Monday night
A meat and potato man
I like my coffee black
My women hot and my beer ice cold
A meat and potato man
A meat and potato man
A meat and potato man
Cornbread and beans and country roots
A meat and potato man
Folks with poodles dressed like kids
When your heart is all alone every second
But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
Play solitaire and stare at the phone
But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
So let's put aside our foolish pride
And let our hearts say hello
We both agree we're just no good
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
Think I'll rejoin the human race
The room spins around when you're kissing me
The thrill is back like it used to be
I sure could use a hair cut and shave
Since you said we were through
I've been down with a case of the blues
But the thrill is back
The room spins around when you're kissing me
The thrill is back like it used to be
I think I'd better give my doctor a call
The room spins around when you're kissing me
The thrill is back like it used to be
The room spins around when you're kissing me
The thrill is back like it used to be
The room spins around when you're kissing me
Your gonna walk out on this heart of mine
You made your mind up and you're gone tonight
If some rainy day your all alone
If you feel the need just click on me.
You won't even have to hold me or look into my eyes
You can tell me that you love me
Through your keyboard and wires
Though you won't have to touch me or even take my hand
Just slide your little mouse around until you see it land.
If you feel the need just click on me.
If you feel the need just click on me.
Barney stopped me with his gun
Ten minutes after midnight
I don't know about that accent son
Just where did you come from
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Well I was south of Detroit City
I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue
I'll be honest with you ma'am
It ain't like mama fixed it
It's cornbread and chicken
Somewhere around Ventura
I lost a universal joint and I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked
If I had plans for dinner
We like the girls that sing soprano
It's cornbread and chicken
Well I was headed home on 65
Somewhere around Kentucky
The CB rang for the bobtail rig
Well I answered him and he asked me
Aren't you from out in Tulsa
I just dropped a load of salsa
Where I come from It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from It's cornbread and chicken
Yeah where I come from
Yeah where I come from
Get back down there sometimes
The dog still barks at every car that comes around
That ain't nothing new
My favorite picture of you is still on my windowsill
You wrote to me don't ever change
And I'm afraid I never will
When day is done the night still comes
While the bridge still burns
And I know there's no use
I'm still a fool and it's so cruel
My favorite picture of you is still on my windowsill
You wrote to me don't ever change
And I'm afraid I never will
But that ain't nothing new
I tried to stay on the straight and narrow
But I've walked a crooked path
And I've felt worthy of forgiveness
Right on the money and off by a mile
Ahead of my time and way out of style
But I've reached out for the glass
I try to pull back on the throttle
But I still run out of gas
I guess I should have known
It tells me just what it wants
Someone who knows what I like in my coffee
A lover who always looks at me not through me
I need a love like that
I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
I need a love like that
Well I need a new car but I can't afford it
My heart's lonely and I can't ignore it
I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
I need a love like that
They don't care where they're at
I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
I need a love like that
I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
A truck needs a highway a train needs a track
And I need a love like that
It's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to be a redneck
Chase around girls on Friday night
It's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to work hard in the sun all day
It's good to be a redneck
Drive by Ernie's for some barbecue
It's alright to be a redneck
The kids are gonna cry
And the chicken's gonna fry
It's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to have a girl
That don't mind a little kiss
When you got a little chew
By the light of the moon
It's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to be a redneck
It's alright to be a redneck now
Maybe I should stay here
For the rest of my life
My compliments to you dear
You're so easy on the eyes
Maybe you should stay here
There's something I must say dear
I'm compelled to let you know
My intuition makes me think
So maybe you should stay here
But honey I don't care
Somebody said only fools rush in
So maybe we should stay here
Like me the night is lonely
Like you the night is young
There's no reason why
We shouldn't have these feelings
So maybe we should stay here
This is a three minute song
To tell her that I love her
How wonderful we get along
A sweet sentiment that's borderline slick
It's a little bit edgy
But softer than spaghetti
It's a way for me to tell her that I love her
But it can't be too long
That stuff it just don't belong
That she's in every breath I draw
And how I can't live without her
And I could never doubt her
A little guitar then it's gone
It's a way for me to tell her that I love her
But it can't be too long
That stuff it just don't belong
That stuff it just don't belong
It was painted red the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
It was just an old plywood boat
With a 75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
Just a little lake cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive
Just an old half ton short bed ford
My Uncle bought new in 64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal
It was just an old hand me down ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower son
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
When Daddy let me drive
3 daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
It's just an old plywood boat
Well tonight if you turn your radio on
About someone who lost everything they had
But I'm a little bluer than that
When you look out in the morning
You might see clouds rolling by like memories
But I'm a little bluer than that
Where did we go wrong
It haunts me all the time
You're always on my mind
I can picture you in his arms tonight
As for me it don't feel right
To let us fade like some old photograph
But I'm a little bluer than that
Where did we go wrong
It haunts me all the time
You're always on my mind
So tonight if you turn your radio on
About someone who lost everything they had
But I'm a little bluer than that
And I can hardly wait
For you to make what wrong today seem right
It's been a long hard day
So bring on the night
And pull down the shades
Lock the world outside
And throw the key away
And turn on the feelings
And turn out the lights
And bring on the night
When the sun goes down
You know how to set things right
Let's put the day behind us
And bring on the night
And pull down the shades
Lock the world outside
And throw the key away
And turn on the feelings
And turn out the lights
And bring on the night
Okay I forgot about the trash
I didn't trim the long hairs on my mustache
All right I admit it I forgot our anniversary
That ain't no big thing but it's a gold star for me
You get tired and disgusted with me
When I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked the Lord to try to help me
He looked down from heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient I'm a work in progress
I read that book you gave me about Mars and Venus
You get tired and disgusted with me
When I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked the Lord to try to help me
He looked down from heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient I'm a work in progress
I know you meant well when you gave me those clogs
But my heels sure get hot down by the muffler on my hog
I'm sure they're stylish but I'll take my boots
I try to do that healthy thing like you want me to do
Now I love your cooking honey
But sometimes I need some real food
You get tired and disgusted with me
When I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked the Lord to try to help me
He looked down from heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient I'm a work in progress
Oh honey just be patient now
I can hear a heartbeat
It seems a little strong
I can hear the things
By looking in her eyes
I can hear the memory
As they echo off the wall
Falling from the pictures
Building up inside of me
I can hear all them things
Stronger than a wind in the willow tree
But I chose to pretend
I should have recognized
That sound way back then
But I just wouldn't listen
And didn't want to all those years
Stronger than a wind in the willow tree
I want you to take them
I couldn't stand for something else to be gone
I think you'll understand why
I'm the designated drinker
To where I can't think of her
I'm the designated drinker
I'd do the same for you
I'm not the kind that likes to drown my sorrows
I may hate myself tomorrow
I'm the designated drinker
To where I can't think of her
I'm the designated drinker
To where we can't think of her
We're the designated drinkers
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
And the greatest is love
Teaching a class full of innocent children
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
And the greatest is love
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
you the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love
And time wasn't such a luxury
If love was lovesick over me
If I could keep the wind in my sails
Keep a hold of the tiger by the tail
A half a ham sandwich in my lunch pail
If everybody everywhere
Had a lighter load to bear
And a little bigger piece of the pie
And that'd be alright
Go heavy on the good and light on the bad
A hair more happy and a shade less sad
Turn all that negative down just a tad
If the family farm never got sold
If another bad joke never got told
If everybody everywhere
Had a lighter load to bear
And a little bigger piece of the pie
And that'd be alright
If everybody everywhere
Had a lighter load to bear
And a little bigger piece of the pie
And that'd be alright
If everybody everywhere
Had a lighter load to bear
And a little bigger piece of the pie
If everybody everywhere
Had a lighter load to bear
And a little bigger piece of the pie
And that'd be alright
Some people never will
Sometimes its hard to know when you got it
Sometimes its perfectly clear
Well I know it's out there
I know the way it should feel
Of once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime love
Love like we've all dreamed of
Right before you very eyes
Once in a lifetime love
So if you think you've got it
You feel it inside ya
Don't let it slip away
Thought you had anyway
You know how lucky you are
A Once in a lifetime love
Once in a lifetime love
Love like we've all dreamed of
Right before your eyes
A Once in a lifetime love
Right before your eyes
Love for me hasn't been easy
I've let true love fall to the ground
Through the years and the tears
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around
When love comes around I'll be ready
Love will find me a brand new man
I'll be standing there with my heart in my hand
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around
Too many times I've lost a good love
And I can't see now how it went
But when love comes back to me
It won't see the same old me
A drunk man walking down a rainy street
A wood floor and new socks on your bare feet
You look down and suddenly you're looking up
A bald tire running on an icy road
A steep hill underneath a foot of snow
A greased pig fallen off a pickup truck
I hope that you're feeling the way that I feel
It's just like flying but you're standing still
The birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
A bad step leading up to your back door
I hope that you're feeling the way that I feel
It's just like flying but you're standing still
The birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
I hope that you're feeling the way that I feel
It's just like flying but you're standing still
The birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
The prettiest thing I'd ever seen in my life
I loved her at first sight
I brought her home to see my folks
We were together for a long time
Thought it would be for all time
But things change and rearrange
My first love was an older woman
There's been many since
But there'll never be another
But I will never she's mine forever
My first love was an older woman
There's been many since
But there'll never be another
I'll never sell her she's mine forever
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young

And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love
Let your heart be light
Happy golden days of yore.
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more.
Through the years we all will be together
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Here to stay is a new bird
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
But you can do the job
As we dream by the fire
Walking in a winter wonderland.
And pretend that he's a circus clown
Until the other kiddies knock him down.
Though your nose gets a chilling
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Born the King of angels
Now in flesh appearing.
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice.
He knows when you're awake.
Santa Claus is coming to town.
Santa Claus is coming to town.
Santa Claus is coming to town.
All the kids in Girl and boy land
They're gonna build a toy land town
Around that Christmas tree.
Santa Claus is coming to town
He knows when you're awake.
Santa Claus is coming to town.
Santa Claus is coming to town.
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
And Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies
Really know how to fly
Round yon virgin mother and child.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Round yon virgin mother and child.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Let it be Christmas everywhere
In the hearts of all people
Feel the love of the season where ever you are
On the small country roads
Lined with green mistletoe
Big city streets where a thousand lights glow
Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
Let it be Christmas everywhere
In the smiles of all children asleep in their beds
In the eyes of young babies
Their first fallen snow
Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
Let it be Christmas everywhere
In the songs that we sing
And the gifts that we bring
In what this day means
From the sandy white beaches
Where blue water rolls
Snow covered mountains and valleys below
Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
We ran into a drifted bank and there we got upset
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
It's Christmas time in the city
Soon it will be Christmas day
Dressed in holiday style
There's a feeling of Christmas
Meeting smile after smile
It's Christmas time in the city
Soon it will be Christmas day
Strings of street lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle
It's Christmas time in the city
Soon it will be Christmas day
It's Christmas time in the city
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
Close by me forever and love me I pray
Bless all of the dear children in thy tender care
Well I was sitting in a roadhouse down on Highway 41
You were wiping off some ketchup on a table that was done
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
And I asked you for a date and then I asked to tie the knot
And I finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car
The last thing I remember I heard myself say
I've never been too good with all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
Standing by a woman in a long white lacy veil
I raised the veil and she smiled at me without her left front tooth
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
I never thought my love life would quite turn out this way
Two young people without a thing
Say some vows and spread their wings
And settle down with just what they need
She just likes the way he smiles
It takes more than marble and tile
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Two old people without a thing
Children gone but still they sing
Side by side on that front porch swing
She can barely sweep the floor
Hand in hand they'll walk through that door
It doesn't take much when you get enough
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
For the Rolling Stones
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Before you drop that quarter
Keep one thing in mind
You got a heartbroke hillbilly
Standing here in line
I've been down and lonely
Before you punch that number
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
For the Rolling Stones
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Against rock and roll
But when your heart's been broken
You need a song that's slow
And don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear George Jones
For the Rolling Stones
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nations
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
He tuned it to a country show
To the crying of a steel guitar
Mama used to sing to me
She taught me that sweet harmony
I'd ever really take it this far
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
An atlas and a coffee cup
Five pickers and an old Dodge truck
For a show on Saturday night
It makes this thing I'm doing seem right
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
He won it thirty years ago
I made it up to music row
Still I wouldn't trade a minute
I wouldn't have it any other way
Just show me to the stage
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
I'd tell you what I'd do
I go downtown buy a Mercury or two
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
I stole her from a friend
He got lucky stole her back again
She heard he had a Mercury
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
Well my baby went out
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
I'd tell you what I'd do
I go downtown buy a Mercury or two
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
Every night she looks in the mirror and she only ages
So she packs her bags to try her hand
But the bills are piling up and the pop scene just ain't on the rally
Be back in the money in no time at all
Everybody's gone country
There are stars in the southern sky
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the seven bridges road.
Like some lonesome child
And I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild.
Sometimes there's a part of me
Has to turn form here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars
Down the seven bridges road.
There are stars in the southern sky
And if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of time sweetened honey
If you wanna drive a big limousine
I'll buy the longest one you've ever seen
If you wanna own a great big mansion
Well I'll give it my utmost attention
It may take a while but I'll prove that it's true
If it's money you want then I'll get it
If you wanna take a trip across the ocean
I'll travel anywhere you take a notion
If you wanna own a great big mansion
It may take a while but I'll prove it's true
If it's money you want then I'll get it
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
The minute that she waltzed right through that door
Now she's with somebody new out on that floor
And she's got the rhythm and I got the blues
She's got the rhythm and I've got the blues
As she spells out regret in perfect time
She's got the rhythm and I got the blues
I'll take the sunshine over the rain
But I can swear that in every way that
But I will give you all that I am
Well I first kissed you on a hollow log
Down by the river they call the Dog
We fell in love and we vowed that day
Like the flow of the river our love won't change
On the bank of the river where the rock juts out
Now the river's still here but you're long gone
You left me and the river here all alone
I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you
I got the Dog River blues
Well the rain came down and the river rose up
Filled up the cab on my pickup truck
It came in the house and down the hall
And washed your picture right off the wall
I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you
I got the Dog River blues
And I pray someday it'll bring you home
If you change your mind honey I'll be here
I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you
I got the Dog River blues
I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you
I got the Dog River blues
For I still got the river but I ain't got you
Sitting at a tiny table in a ritzy restaurant
She was staring at her coffee cup
He was trying to keep his courage up by buying booze
The talk was small when they talked at all
They both knew what they wanted
There was no need to talk about it
He went to the Family Inn
She didn't even have to pretend she didn't know what for
He came back with the key
With a bamboo cane stuck in the sand
She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring
I may tell a lot of stories that may not be true
But I can get to Heaven just as easy as you
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught
Down by the river on a Friday night
Pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
Have a little love on a little honeymoon
You got a little dish and you got a little spoon
A little bitty house and a little bitty yard
A little bitty dog and a little bitty car
A little hometown or a big old city
Life goes on for a little bitty while
A little bitty baby in a little bitty gown
It'll grow up in a little bitty town
A big yellow bus and little bitty books
It all started with a little bitty look
A little hometown or a big old city
Life goes on for a little bitty while
You know you got a job and a little bitty check
A six pack of beer and television set
Little bitty world goes around and around
Little bit of silence and a little bit of sound
Start all over in a little bitty world
Little bitty plan and a little bitty dream
It's all part of a little bitty scheme
It's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Life goes on for a little bitty while
It's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Life goes on for a little bitty while
Coffee keeps me up and I can't sleep
And when I drink too much then I can't eat
Losing you has led me to believe
Everything I love gonna have to give up
I guess I made a big mistake
Everything I love gonna have to give up
Everything I love gonna have to give up
On the trouble of a woman and a man
But you can not impose
You can't stick your nose
Into something that you don't understand
And who don't even care anymore
And who's car is parked next door
I thought I knew her well
I really couldn't tell
That she had another lover on her mind
You see it felt so right
When she held me tight
How could I be so blind
And who don't even care anymore
Who's car is parked next door
A heart is on the line
Love is stolen in the shadows of the night
Though it's wrong all along
Who don't even care anymore
Who's car is parked next door
And who don't even care anymore
Who's car is parked next door
And who don't even care anymore
Well I just looked where I don't see
Like some big black widow spider
You know just how to catch your prey
And you sneak up from behind and whisper my name
And there go the words I meant to say
There go the games I wanted to play
You like to see what you can do
And there go the words I meant to say
There go the games I wanted to play
When I look into your soft green eyes
When I see your delicate body
Revealed to me as you slip off your dress
I'm reminded what I feel for you
Will remain strong and true
Long after the pleasures of the flesh
Then I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
Be it the wind or the rain
Or the moon up in the sky
The spin of the earth or the changes in the tide
I don't know what brought us together
What strange forces of nature
Conspire to construct the present
Then I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
When I look into your soft green eyes
When I see your delicate body
Revealed to me as you slip off your dress
I'm reminded what I feel for you
Will remain strong and true
Long after the pleasures of the flesh
Then I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
Let's begin with the day I met her
How fast this good old boys world got better
Just the first few seconds after I first seen her
My best old jeans and my broken sneakers
Sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
She's the best cook that's ever melted cheese
There's absolutely no reason to doubt it
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
Here I am alone again tonight
In this old empty house
Its hard to learn what you don't think you need
That you can't live without
Never leave the sound of the telephone
But ever since you left
I've asked myself the reasons
Going up and down this hall way
Trying to leave the pain behind
Never saw your face this many times
When you were really here
Things you said I never understood
Never spent this much time alone
But ever since you left
I've asked myself the reasons
Going up and down this hall way
Trying to leave the pain behind
They ware the little man
I go back now and the stores are empty
Except for an old coke sign dated 1950
Boarded up like they never existed
Or renovated and called historic districts
There goes the little man
There goes the little man
Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
And killed the little man
He pumped your gas and he cleaned your glass
And one cold rainy night he fixed your flat
The new stores came where you do it yourself
You buy a lotto ticket and food off the shelf
Forget the little man
Forget about that little man
He hung on there for a few more years
And he wouldn't sell beer
Now the bank rents the station
To a man down the road
And they sell velvet Elvis and
There goes little man
There goes another little man
Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
And killed the little man
Now the stores are lined up in a concrete strip
You can buy the whole world in just one trip
They don't even realize
Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
And killed the little man
It wasn't long ago when I was a child
An old black man came with his mule and his plow
He broke the ground where we grew our garden
Long live the little man
I've just got time for one more round
And you can let some other fool sit down
I'd like for you'd to listen to
Did you ever hear of a clown with tear
I think I'll have another round
And you can let some other fool sit down
Home for me is misery
And here I'm wasting time
Is not what's on my mind
But then you see her leaving me
It's not what I prefer
I think I'll have another round
And you can let some other fool sit down
Hey baby you ain't got to prove to me you're some kind of macho man
First I get cold and hot
There's nothing I can do
All that I want is you
Look what I'm going through
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
Something is wrong or right
I think of you all night
Seeing you in my dreams
Holding you close to me
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
Your gonna walk out on this heart of mine
You made your mind up and you're gone tonight
If some rainy day your all alone
If you feel the need just click on me.
You won't even have to hold me or look into my eyes
You can tell me that you love me
Through your keyboard and wires
Though you won't have to touch me or even take my hand
Just slide your little mouse around until you see it land.
If you feel the need just click on me.
If you feel the need just click on me.
When your heart is all alone every second
But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
Play solitaire and stare at the phone
But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
So let's put aside our foolish pride
And let our hearts say hello
We both agree we're just no good
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
Barney stopped me with his gun
Ten minutes after midnight
I don't know about that accent son
Just where did you come from
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Well I was south of Detroit City
I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue
I'll be honest with you ma'am
It ain't like mama fixed it
It's cornbread and chicken
Somewhere around Ventura
I lost a universal joint and I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked
If I had plans for dinner
We like the girls that sing soprano
It's cornbread and chicken
Well I was headed home on 65
Somewhere around Kentucky
The CB rang for the bobtail rig
Well I answered him and he asked me
Aren't you from out in Tulsa
I just dropped a load of salsa
Where I come from It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from It's cornbread and chicken
Yeah where I come from
Yeah where I come from
Get back down there sometimes
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
And the greatest is love
Teaching a class full of innocent children
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
And the greatest is love
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
you the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love
It was painted red the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
It was just an old plywood boat
With a 75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
Just a little lake cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive
Just an old half ton short bed ford
My Uncle bought new in 64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal
It was just an old hand me down ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower son
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
When Daddy let me drive
3 daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
It's just an old plywood boat
Remember when I was young and so were you
Remember when we vowed the vows and walked the walk
Remember when old ones died and new were born
Was the music we danced to week to week
Remember when thirty seemed so old
When the children grow up and move away
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when
Well I know sometimes you find it hard
To understand just what we do out here
Well that bus rolls up at home
And I sure don't like to leave you
Couldn't stand for you to think that I don't care
So I wrote this job description
Just to tell you what I do when I'm not there
I sleep eighty miles an hour
To the whining of a diesel down the interstate
The easy chair that sits beside the fireplace
Then we shut her down in another town
Shower up and do just what we came to do
Count the money and the miles back home to you
Well each night I take the stage
With a six piece band and a guitar in my hand
All the good times and the bad
Then we say goodbye and we load it up
And head somewhere I've already been
Then I lay down in that double bed alone
And I thank the Lord again
I sleep eighty miles an hour
To the whining of a diesel down the interstate
The easy chair that sits beside the fireplace
Then we shut her down in another town
Shower up and do just what we came to do
Count the money and the miles back home to you
Well I just sing for the people
I thought some time in the sun
Would help me get over you
But I could tell from day one
This is a place meant for two
Now here I sit on the beach
Watching the tide ebb and flow
I booked my room for a week
But now I'm ready to go
I'm in a tropical depression
I've got the blue water blues
Can't shake this loving you obsession
Can't stand this sand in my shoes
This forgetting you vacation
Is just a fool's holiday
If I can't get over you
This tropical depression is gonna
This should be paradise
Heaven down by the sea
Without you here by my side
It feels like hell to me
I'm in a tropical depression
I've got the blue water blues
Can't shake this loving you obsession
Can't stand this sand in my shoes
This forgetting you vacation
Is just a fool's holiday
If I can't get over you
This tropical depression is gonna
If I can't get over you
This tropical depression is gonna
I'm always on the road
You're always all alone
And I'm not always there when I'm at home
But I'm ready for a little change
I'm ready to accept some blame
So let's back up to yesterday
Let's get back in love
All those little things we used to do
When all we had was enough
Well I don't like the blues
I like love that's true
Let's get back in love
All those little things we used to do
Let's get back in love
All those little things we used to do
Let's get back in love
All those little things we used to do
You say you're heart's been broken
And you just can't win
You say that you'll never find love again
Let me tell you friend
You can't give up on love
That's the one thing we've got to keep going
Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
But you can't give up on love
It's another broken family
You can't give up on love
That's the one thing we've got to keep going
Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
But you can't give up on love
Troubled times make it hard to stay
So many lovers take the easy way
But don't go crazy and jump ship too soon
You can't give up on love
That's the one thing we've got to keep going
Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
But you can't give up on love
No you can't give up on love
There's a hole in the wall
Where a nail used to be
A nail that held a picture of
The one that once held me
What I don't wanna hear
Oh I guess a saner man
Would simply paint it
But I'm not sane and after all
I've got this hammer in my hand
There'll be a hole in that wall
Big enough to drive a truck through
When you lose the greatest love
A little hole in the wall
Is enough to drive you mad
Oh I guess a saner man
Would simply paint it
But I'm not sane and after all
I've got this hammer in my hand
There'll be a hole in that wall
Big enough to drive a truck through
Oh I've got this hammer in my hand
There'll be a hole in that wall
How long will I love you
I'd like to think forever
Is how far we could go
So let me paint a picture
The day you don't mean everything to me
When a nickel's worth a dollar
And gold ain't worth a dime
When they build a ship on waters that will take you back in time
When the stars have all been counted
Now you don't have to worry
About what comes to pass
This old world may wear out
But my love's gonna last
If they ever build that highway to the moon
I'll just find something else to promise you
When a nickel's worth a dollar
And gold ain't worth a dime
When they build a ship on waters that will take you back in time
When the stars have all been counted
Oh when the stars have all be counted
Love for me hasn't been easy
I've let true love fall to the ground
Through the years and the tears
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around
When love comes around I'll be ready
Love will find me a brand new man
I'll be standing there with my heart in my hand
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around
Too many times I've lost a good love
And I can't see now how it went
But when love comes back to me
It won't see the same old me
I can hear a heartbeat
It seems a little strong
I can hear the things
By looking in her eyes
I can hear the memory
As they echo off the wall
Falling from the pictures
Building up inside of me
I can hear all them things
Stronger than a wind in the willow tree
But I chose to pretend
I should have recognized
That sound way back then
But I just wouldn't listen
And didn't want to all those years
Stronger than a wind in the willow tree
Smiles in the morning as warm as sunshine
Kisses when I lay down at night
And two loving arms to console me
I should be scared it's so right
Feelings like this can't be wrong
And we've got a good thing going on.
Some would say it's too perfect
But I don't think what we have is so bad.
Feelings like this can't be wrong
And we've got a good thing going on.
I need some sunshine on my face
To help me dry my eyes
I need a blue sky over here
So I can clear my mind.
Maybe a soft breeze on my back
To make me feel at ease
Anything more than what I've got
On this rainy day in June.
It's a rainy day in June
On this rainy day in June.
Yesterday morning I woke up
On the wrong side of the bed
And on the right side laid a note
I don't know if it will
But I'll keep waiting with the hopeful heart
On this rainy day in June.
It's a rainy day in June
On this rainy day in June.
Every thought begins with you
I see your face in every cloud that passes
On this rainy day in June.
It's a rainy day in June
How I'm getting along
I guess that you think I can't make it
I don't want you to worry
Don't want you to lose any sleep
But a man called long distance this morning
Said they're thinking about putting me.
On the cover of the USA Today
Story of heartbreaking pain
Picture of the loneliest man they claim
Darkness reminds me of you
I lost 8 pounds since last Tuesday
But could stand to lose a few.
I don't believe I'm too bad
People say I look fine
The man from the paper seems happy
Says I'm bigger than the latest crime.
On the cover of the USA Today
Story of heartbreaking pain
Picture of the loneliest man they claim
So if you're concerned and troubled
Think you're hurting me
Has made a big man out of me.
I'm on the cover of the USA Today
Story of heartbreaking pain
Picture of the loneliest man they claim
And I was a drowning man
Would you get in the water
Would you lend me a hand
Would you sit on the land
If love was a mountain
Would you climb to the top
Would you never look down
If love was a mountain
Love rarely knocks so many times upon your door
And heaven only knows if it will come back anymore
If love was a firefly
Would you laugh when it twinkled
If love was a firefly
With everyone you know
Would you dance if I asked you
Would you smile and say no
Love rarely knocks so many times upon your door
And heaven only knows if it will come back anymore
Would you turn in your ticket
Would you never look back
If love was a fast train
Will I need a miss of my life
And love's no exception to this rule
Now I'm feeling lonesome and blue
Just the way I expect to.
But there's something that I could use
To help me deal with this abuse
If French fries were fat free
And you still love me.
If French fries were fat free
And you still love me.
What a wonderful world this would be
If the whiskey really helped me
I'd wear a smile endlessly
If French fries were fat free
And you still love me.
You know the more I think about you
The more sense it makes
Cause grease and love both cause heartache
So I raise my glass and toast
These things I want the most.
Though I probably never see
I can't help but believing
That if French fries were fat free
And you still love me
What a wonderful world this would be
If the whiskey really helped me.
I'd wear a smile endlessly
If French fries were fat free
And you still love me
The kiss was colder than I remember
When we first said hello
I guess the flame's now a little lower
I can feel you letting go.
You know the pain drops a little darker
Then when you first put it on
I guess your love's like some old cheap and magic marker
Said forever nice go.
But you don't have to paint me a picture
You don't have to say things at all
You don't have to paint me a picture
I can see in the writing on the wall.
Summer nights and winter days
Hand in hand in the haze.
Now it's cold heart summer evenings
And there's clouds on my sunrise
But you don't have to smile and say you're happy
I can see what's in your eyes.
You don't have to paint me a picture
You don't have to say things at all
You don't have to paint me a picture
Starting over again is a bit like dancing
You just need someone to lead and take it slow
So lay your head on my shoulder
Put one foot in front of the other
And the next thing you know
Every day is like a new beginning
But just slip your arms around me
Put one foot in front of the other
And the next thing you know
I know how it feels to have your heart crossed
Like the wings of the butterfly
So just hold on tight.
Put one foot in front of the other
And the next thing you know
The mechanic raised up from under my hood
Those spark plug wires are a little too long
And that water pump's nearly down a quart
Just give me the word and I'm ready to start
He sat down and played me a song by the grease rack
And I closed my eyes and pondered awhile
I hate to be the one to give you this news
But your whole melodic structure's worked itself loose
It's got so many dotted eighth notes in it
I'd keep her under fifty beats per minute
That dominant chord with the augmented fifth
Just see how dangerously high it raises you up
So just go on over there and work on my car
I'll sit here by the fan and chances are
It won't take too long
I just took your picture off the table
And I just took your picture off the wall
Hide from you anywhere I'm able
But there's one place I can't hide from you at all.
Strong enough to get her off my mind.
Memories seem to know just where to find me
And lately they're all that I recall
And everything in this old house reminds me
Of the love I had and how I lost it all.
Strong enough to get her off my mind.
Days go by and I still feel the sorrow
And time don't make a difference in the pain
Just sitting here and waiting on tomorrow
Will drive me crazy if I don't go insane.
Strong enough to get her off my mind.
Strong enough to get her off my mind.
You left your bible on the dresser
So I put it in the drawer
Without yelling anymore
I can almost here those hymns
The keys are just collecting dust
But I can't close the lid.
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith
And now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
Things are only getting worse
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church.
The preacher came by Sunday
Said he missed me at the service
He told me Jesus loves me
But I'm not sure I deserve it
Is nowhere to be found
Since they took all that he believed
And laid it in the ground.
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith
And now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
Things are only getting worse
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church.
I still believe in Heaven
And I'm sure you've made it there
I don't have a prayer.
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith
And now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
Things are only getting worse
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church.
You left your bible on the dresser
Smoke's been rising all over town
When they caught her with them matches
I tried but I could not put them out
Did the best to save the whiskey
But the flame's just too risky
She couldn't stop that honky tonk sound
When I ran out with my fiddle
Said she felt no remorse
Smoke's been a rising all over town
I've shoveled manure till my pride hurt.
I've been evicted for not making rent
Made my Daddy wonder where my good sense went.
So I stand here tonight with this six string guitar
To be something I've always been in my heart.
Just for the chance to play you my song
The thrill when I hear you singing along.
It's been worth everything I've been through
I've played for empty tables and chairs
So I hope the critics and skeptics alike
All bought a ticket to this show tonight.
And they'll see firsthand that I have survived
And what doesn't kill you makes you more alive.
And I'm one of the fortunate few
There's so much joy this music can bring
So I count my blessings when I step up to sing.
Praising my Savior all the day long.
Angels descending bring from above
Calling for you and for me.
Watching for you and for me.
Promised for you and for me.
Pardon for you and for me.
I love to tell the story
Of Jesus and his love.
It satisfies my longings
As nothing else can do.
Of Jesus and his love.
For those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting
To hear it like the rest.
That I have loved so long.
Sing his mercy and his grace.
In the mansions bright and blessed
He'll prepare for us a place.
We shall tread the streets of gold.
Wilt be with me to the end.
I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
The Son of God discloses
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
I'd stay in the garden with Him
His voice to me is calling
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
Lay aside your garments that are stained with sin
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb.
There's a fountain flowing for the soul unclean.
What a privilege to carry
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer.
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Standing on the promises of God.
I'm standing on the promises of God.
Standing on the promises of God.
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.
Through death into life everlasting
Over us sin no more hath dominion
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.
Believe Him and all will be well.
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.
And exchange it some day for a crown.
Where his glory forever I'll share.
When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the works
I hear the rolling thunder
The universe displayed
When Christ shall come
With shouts of adulation
What joy shall fill my heart
And there proclaim My God
If I survey all the good things that come to me from above
If I count all the blessings from the storehouse of love
I'd simply ask for the favor of him beyond mortal king
And I'm sure he would grant it again
I want to stroll over Heaven with you some glad day
When all our troubles and heartaches are vanished away
Then we'll enjoy the beauty where all things are new
I want to stroll over Heaven with you
So many places of beauty we long to see here below
But time and treasures have kept us from making plans as you know
But come the morning of rapture together we'll stand a new
While I stroll over Heaven with you
I want to stroll over Heaven with you some glad day
When all our troubles and heartaches are vanished away
Then we'll enjoy the beauty where all things are new
Another night has made me stop
My weary bones can go no farther
And here is where they'll drop
In my dreams your arms will find me
They will hold me through the night
Then release me to my journey
As another day grows light
I've got so many miles to go
Right now all I want to do
Is be anywhere on earth you are
I have always been a gypsy
And the road call me to roam
But each day brings me closer
To the place where we call home
I've got so many miles to go
Right now all I want to do
Is be anywhere on earth you are
In my dreams your arms will find me
They will hold me through the night
Right now all I want to do
And hung up the phone
And my friends say I should be happy
This is a good imitation of the blues
You threatened to leave
And now that you're gone
With this good imitation of the blues
You're no good without me
And they say that I'm
With this good imitation of the blues
You threatened to leave
And now that you're gone
When your lips first smiled at me
I was captured instantly
The gaze of your willing eyes
Touched something deep inside
That I love you like all little children love pennies
You're where I belong
And I love you like all little children love pennies
And I love you like good times of which I've known many
You make my blood flow
Nobody said that it would be easy
Cause honey I found I can't settle down
On my road there's another town
Where the people wanna hear a man
Nobody said that it would be easy
Stay at home all alone
Honey I found I can't settle down
For a new pair of boots
And the way out the door
Nobody said that it would be easy
Sometimes you'll get confused
But honey I found I can't settle down
At the end of my road
Where the people wanna hear a man
A dreamer a drifter and more
For a new pair of boots
And a way out the door
Nobody said that it would be easy
Sometimes you'll get confused
But honey I found I can't settle down
At the end of my road
Yeah honey I found I can't settle down
At the end of my road
Where the people wanna hear a man
Girl you're my sunshine
Chase away the raindrops
Make it all worthwhile
Make all the pain stop
Don't let our world stop
I like it just the way you are
Honey don't change who you are
Don't you change on me
Girl you're my lucky star
Honey don't change who you are
Some kind of happiness
I love you just the way you are
Honey don't change who you are
Girl don't change on me
Don't you change on me
Girl you're my lucky star
Honey don't change who you are
Don't you change on me
Lord knows I wanna know you
No more stormy weather
I love you just the way you are
Honey don't change who you are
Don't you change on me
Girl you're my lucky star
Honey don't change who you are
I love you just the way you are
Honey don't change who you are
Don't you change on me
Girl you're my lucky star
Honey don't change who you are
I used to run in a young man's boots
With a young man's heart
And a young man's roots
But now I stand where a young man stood before
I don't run like I used to
This old man don't run no more
Don't believe for a second
That my key won't fit your door
This old man wants you more
I used to go where the devil wouldn't go
Where the river run still
And the water don't flow
Heaven couldn't stop me then
And the creek don't rise
Where the devil sits with a grin
I used to sing with a young man's voice
And a young man's choice
Hope my song is what you're longing for
I don't sing like I used to
Sometimes less is more
I used to go where the devil wouldn't go
Where the river run still
And the water don't flow
Heaven couldn't stop me then
And the creek don't rise
Where the devil sits with a grin
Well this crazy life is all we got
Like a shoestring tied in a beggar's knot
In the end that's what this story shows
I don't love you like I used to
This old man loves you more
I don't love ya like a used to
The girl's wouldn't look anything like they do
Can't imagine my life without dresses and shoes
Or never taking a sunset from a front porch swing
Or make any sense of the pleasure love brings
I'd been alone for sure
I wouldn't reach for your arms
When my dreams don't come true
Never sit holding hands
On a crowded church pew
I wouldn't smile when my fingers run through your hair
Or laugh when we race to the top of the stairs
You know there are times
That I can't wait to pick up the phone
And the three little voices
That always chime in right along
Oh I never would see through
Would have overlooked
A view that some just talk of
It's hard to describe
In just words how I feel
When I hold stand beside you
It's just time that I kill
When I'm alone and without you
I will love all through the night
As long as I wake up each morning
I'll know I'm the only one around
I'd never have taken in a sunset from the front porch swing
Or make any sense of the pleasure love brings
I'd been alone for sure
I'll never understand
All the little things
I'll never come Face to face
From a long time ago.
I've never really been before.
Ask me now and I won't tell a lie.
Ask me how I've been feeling inside.
Ask me if I really mean it
When I tell you I love you.
Ask me will I please repeat it.
I'll tell you forever if you want me to.
Ask me now and I won't tell a lie.
Ask me how I've been feeling inside.
But it won't shine brighter
Than the stars in your eyes
So bright and so blue
And I won't see anyone
Take me into the night
Pass these lonely dreams
More than I can show you
More than I can know in my heart
So lay down beside me
For your love has found me
And it feels so right
These thoughts in my mind
Are so scattered and few
But I won't see anyone
Take me into the night
Pass these lonely dreams
More than I can show you
More than I can know in my heart
Well I came from Alabama
With a banjo on my knee
My true love for to see
It rained all night the day I left
The weather it was dry
The sun so hot I froze to death
Suzanna don't you cry
I got a long way to go
I sure feel it now deep down in these dusty clothes
Through another town backed up with capricious souls
I got a long way to go
I got a lot left to say
To the empty seat that stood beside me
Through the midnight moon
Saw fit to light my way
Got a lot left to say
But where do I go from here
When I'm lost out on the road
To find my way back home
The only voice that leads me on
So I can find my way back to you
I had a dream the other night
When everything was still
I thought I saw Suzanna
The buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye
Suzanna don't you cry
Where do I go from here
When I'm lost out on the road
And the way's not clear
To find my way back home
The only voice that leads me on
So I can find my way back to you
Soon we'll be in New Orleans
Then I'll look around
And when I find Suzanna
I'll fall down on the ground
And if I do not find her
Then I should surely die
And when I'm dead and buried
I'm lost in the night
The icy wind is howling out your name
The moon is gone behind the clouds again
And I can't stand to live
Cause my bluebird went away
And I'm locked in this room
And my only connection
Well I'm out on a limb
If I could only find sweet love again
To live my life this way is too much to bear
Can't find my bluebird anywhere
The moon is gone behind the clouds again
And I can't stand to live another day
That's when all the conditions are right
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
It's time for a good time
Pick up my baby and turn it around
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
Rowdy friends all night long
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
It's time for a good time
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
It's time for a good time
Sweet southern woman set on my lap
T with an I and an M and an E
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
That spells good time
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
Head for that Waffle House way across town
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
It's time for a good time
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
It's time for a good time
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
It's time for a good time
Born the middle son of a farmer
And a small town Southern man
Like his daddy's daddy before him
Fell in love with a small town woman
And they married up and settled down
For a small town Southern man
First there came four pretty daughters
For this small town Southern man
Then a few years later came another
In a house built with his own hands
From a small town Southern man
And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He was always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man
Callous hands told the story
For this small town Southern man
He gave it all to keep it all together
And keep his family on his land
Made it hard just to walk and stand
You can break the back
But you can't break the spirit
Of a small town Southern man
And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He's always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man
For this small town Southern man
And they got me by the hand
I'm blessed and I know I am
And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
I wish I could back up and start all over
Cause now I'd know better the best way to love her
The words I would tell her the time I would give her
I wish I could back up and start all over
It changes the reasons
You wanted to hold her
I wish I could back up and start all over
I wish I could back up and start all over
I'd make the first time feel like forever
Not to be younger may be just to be smarter
I wish I could back up and start all over
It changes the reasons
You wanted to hold her
I wish I could back up and start all over
I wish I could back up and start all over
Days I would take back nights I'd wanna make longer
Moments I'd never just throw over my shoulder
I wish I could back up and start all over
But it's never too late to wanna do better
Some days it's raining some are sunny and blue
There's never perfect but there's faithful and true
It changes the reasons
You wanted to hold her
I wish I could back up and start all over
I can get you where you need to go
In the woods or right uptown
I can get you where you need to go
I can get you where you need to go
I can get you where you need to go
I can get you where you need to go
So it won't have to brave
But you take me some place that I've never been
Now I don't know if I'll find my way back again
And there's not a thing I can't do
Completely consume all about you
You've got me right where I want you
I close my eyes you're looking at me
You wake me at night walking round in my dreams
Windows are smell of roses in blue
And all I can think of is last night's perfume
And there's not a thing I can't do
Completely consume all about you
You've got me right where I want you
And I've never thought that I would get caught
But here I am wrapped up in you
And there's not a thing I can't do
Completely consume all about you
You've got me right where I want you
Eight track tapes were still in style and Elvis was still alive
Built a fire that just wont quit and that was 1976
Tonight it doesn't feel like it did last night
I'm feeling warm if inside
Since I saw your face
Since I looked in your eyes
There's a change in this place
I think the love factor's high
When the love factor's high
And too hard to collide
That's when you'll find
When the love factor's high
Sometimes it flies and sometimes it falls
Ends up against the wall
But I think I know the love factor's high
When the love factor's high
And too hard to collide
That's when you'll find
When the love factor's high
It happens every time I think about the reasons why
I'm seating here alone at night and not with you.
Heartache takes control and lets me know
Just what a fool I was and how you can't erase the things you do.
Brake apart is what most broken hearts still you to do.
But I made long long way from over you
Don't think I've ever seen so many shades of blue.
They say the time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
Now over you the sound like some lost city
Of course now I see that I had the best in you.
I'm still a long long way from over you
Don't think I've ever seen so many shades of blue.
They say the time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
I'm still a long long way from over you
Don't think I've ever seen so many shades of blue.
They say the time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
They say the time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
Why did she have to go
So young I just don't know why
Things happen half the time
Without reason without rhyme
Lovely sweet young woman
Daughter wife and mother
I just have to believe
Loved ones she left behind
And understand the why
Anger shot straight at God
Then asking for His love
Just hoping that maybe
It's hard to say goodbye
Her picture in my mind
Will always be of times I'll cherish
Satellite communications
A little faster every day
And I don't embrace it
But I wouldn't wanna go
Backwards even if I could
The grass between my toes
And that sunset sinking low
And a good woman's love
The grass between my toes
And that sunset sinking low
And a good woman's love
And you can save about
That's ever been made
The grass between my toes
And that sunset sinking low
And a good woman's love
The grass between my toes
And that sunset sinking low
And a good woman's love
Half the time I don't what my name is
I'm the kind that likes to take it slow and lazy
Girl you got me running hot and hazy
You stole my heart and stuck it in your pocket
Now I got your face inside my locket
I really tried but I don't think I can stop it
You sat beside my last night on the sofa
I took your hand and pulled you a little closer
You kissed my lips then let me hold you
You held the door when we went to the movies
I like your quirky sneaky sense of humor
You're strong and sweet in all the things I needed
When it's time for you to leave me
Every time that you are near me
And sat on the porch with my Labrador like a hundred other times before
We burn it fast and then retire just before the news on channel five
Kiss me once and just
I can taste your lips
Listen to your senses
What they have to say
And love can save you
Today is not like yesterday
I can taste your lips
Listen to your senses
What they have to say
I can taste your lips
Listen to your senses
What they have to say
Listen to your senses
What they have to say
There's an old hardwood tree
Staring through the glass at me
Sometimes I think it reads my mind
There's no denying that I've been hiding from this thing that's chasing me
No good at shunning all these scars from yesterday
Spin that wheel and try your luck
It might be love this time
I knew it from that very first smile
I could taste it like a hungry child
You know they say that last is best
Just to shout it takes my breath away
And there's no denying that I've been hiding from this thing that's chasing me
No good at shunning all these scars from yesterday
Spin that wheel and try your luck
It might be love this time
I've been hiding from this thing that's chasing me
No good at shunning all these scars from yesterday
Spin that wheel and try your luck
It might be love this time
Gentle roar of the wave on the shore
Makes its way through the crack neath the door
Wake up call from the ocean floor down in Avid Cove
What do you need tonight
Something hot to stir one up
Just two things I'll request
And some quarters for these dollars
And play every sad song on the jukebox
Songs of loving and leaving lying and cheating
Songs of hurting and crying and even songs of dying
If you wanna make me happy
Pour me some bourbon on the rocks
And play every sad song on the jukebox
I've seen that look that's in your eyes
I deserved it I guess
But it still hurts me all alone
At night there by myself
And play every sad song on the jukebox
Songs of loving and leaving lying and cheating
Songs of hurting and crying and even songs of dying
If you wanna make me happy
Pour me some bourbon on the rocks
And play every sad song on the jukebox
If you wanna make me happy
Pour me some bourbon on the rocks
Common man of men and the King of many
Common man of men and the King of many
Surround himself with the good old boys to tell His tale
Common man of men and the King of many
Some folks would say it wasn't really Him
Common man of men and the King of many
The minute that she waltzed right through that door
Now she's with somebody new out on that floor
And she's got the rhythm and I got the blues
She's got the rhythm and I've got the blues
As she spells out regret in perfect time
She's got the rhythm and I got the blues
I thought some time in the sun
Would help me get over you
But I could tell from day one
This is a place meant for two
Now here I sit on the beach
Watching the tide ebb and flow
I booked my room for a week
But now I'm ready to go
I'm in a tropical depression
I've got the blue water blues
Can't shake this loving you obsession
Can't stand this sand in my shoes
This forgetting you vacation
Is just a fool's holiday
If I can't get over you
This tropical depression is gonna
This should be paradise
Heaven down by the sea
Without you here by my side
It feels like hell to me
I'm in a tropical depression
I've got the blue water blues
Can't shake this loving you obsession
Can't stand this sand in my shoes
This forgetting you vacation
Is just a fool's holiday
If I can't get over you
This tropical depression is gonna
If I can't get over you
This tropical depression is gonna
Two young people without a thing
Say some vows and spread their wings
And settle down with just what they need
She just likes the way he smiles
It takes more than marble and tile
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Two old people without a thing
Children gone but still they sing
Side by side on that front porch swing
She can barely sweep the floor
Hand in hand they'll walk through that door
It doesn't take much when you get enough
It doesn't take much when you get enough
You say you're heart's been broken
And you just can't win
You say that you'll never find love again
Let me tell you friend
You can't give up on love
That's the one thing we've got to keep going
Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
But you can't give up on love
It's another broken family
You can't give up on love
That's the one thing we've got to keep going
Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
But you can't give up on love
Troubled times make it hard to stay
So many lovers take the easy way
But don't go crazy and jump ship too soon
You can't give up on love
That's the one thing we've got to keep going
Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
But you can't give up on love
No you can't give up on love
Here I am alone again tonight
In this old empty house
Its hard to learn what you don't think you need
That you can't live without
Never leave the sound of the telephone
But ever since you left
I've asked myself the reasons
Going up and down this hall way
Trying to leave the pain behind
Never saw your face this many times
When you were really here
Things you said I never understood
Never spent this much time alone
But ever since you left
I've asked myself the reasons
Going up and down this hall way
Trying to leave the pain behind
When your heart is all alone every second
But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
Play solitaire and stare at the phone
But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
So let's put aside our foolish pride
And let our hearts say hello
We both agree we're just no good
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
Remember when I was young and so were you
Remember when we vowed the vows and walked the walk
Remember when old ones died and new were born
Was the music we danced to week to week
Remember when thirty seemed so old
When the children grow up and move away
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when
I need some sunshine on my face
To help me dry my eyes
I need a blue sky over here
So I can clear my mind.
Maybe a soft breeze on my back
To make me feel at ease
Anything more than what I've got
On this rainy day in June.
It's a rainy day in June
On this rainy day in June.
Yesterday morning I woke up
On the wrong side of the bed
And on the right side laid a note
I don't know if it will
But I'll keep waiting with the hopeful heart
On this rainy day in June.
It's a rainy day in June
On this rainy day in June.
Every thought begins with you
I see your face in every cloud that passes
On this rainy day in June.
It's a rainy day in June
I'll never understand
All the little things
I'll never come Face to face
But without you I know how I'd be...
Imagine a day without sunshine
Or a mountain not having a view.
And picture the Heavens not holding the stars.
That's what I'd be like without you.
It scares me to think I could lose you
I know how I'd be on my own...
Imagine a day without sunshine
Or a mountain not having a view.
And picture the Heavens not holding the stars.
That's what I'd be like without you.
You found your greener pastures in a mansion on a hill
You said you needed simple things that I had plenty of
And I heard you laughed your cares away on a Caribbean cruise.
But there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer
Kind of glue that sticks this world together
Hands of steel and cradle of the Promised Land
God bless the working man
All week long making a living
Hardly noticed but part of everything
But there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer
Kind of glue that sticks this world together
Hands of steel and cradle of the Promised Land
God bless the working man
He gives his life then fades away
Another young man takes his place
But there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer
Kind of glue that sticks this world together
Hands of steel and cradle of the Promised Land
Kind of glue that sticks this world together
Hands of steel and cradle of the Promised Land
God bless the working man
The love you thought was dead and gone
Somehow keeps on hanging on
Even when your heart has left it far behind
Just when you have turned the page
It seems to find a way
And every now and then that old feeling comes around
Every now and then I see your face in another cloud
And every now and then some old something takes me right back again
You can finally breathe life in
Without wondering where she's been
Go to sleep at night without her on your mind
In a second it appears
Followed by familiar tears
Like a long lost friend
And every now and then that old feeling comes around
Every now and then I see your face in another cloud
And every now and then some old something takes me right back again
And I know it's all for nothing
There's no going back to way back then
And every now and then that old feeling comes around
Every now and then I see your face in another cloud
And every now and then some old something takes me right back again
Her right hand closed the front porch door
Suddenly a child no more
All the ribbons all the bows in a box now on her closet floor
Anxious for what's to come
Afraid to leave a place she loves
She's not a woman not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
Broken hearts and rusted dreams
Sometimes make it hard to leave and
Certainty is out of reach even with some self belief
So she bites her lip and shows a smile
Flips her hair and flaunts her style
She's not a woman not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
Her memories she stowed away
Pulls them out on rainy days
And brand new faces take their place
Beside the ones that never fade
Whatever the cost she plays the part
She's not a woman not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
Her right hand closed the front porch door
And goes back down at the end of every day
Man in the moon comes up to play
The ocean wet the desert dry
My love for you will never change
I just came down from Chippewa
Had a station wagon and a hundred dollars
Thinking about the girl I'd lost a year before
I hadn't seen her for some time
Thought I might go on by when your memory came flooding in and you closed that door
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didn't have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train
Well every time I talk to you I hear your jealous lines
I feel like I've been left abandoned on some old railway side
And every time I hear your voice my water just gets cold
My stoker will not stoke and my boiler will not boil
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didn't have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train
Well every time I fell behind I could not get ahead
I wish someone would pull the lever and give me a little sand
And every time I slip behind even further back
I wish some switch man would come out of the fog and change my track
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didn't have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didn't have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
You got the last of all your stuff
You got your car cranked up
And I guess there ain't a thing that I can say
I'm thinking as I'm standing here
And suddenly it all comes clear
As I watch you drive away
They should have made tail lights blue
So when I see them go
They'll look the way I do
Just a pale blue glow
They should have made I can't stay
Sound like I love you
You know they should have made tail lights blue
I know it's gonna take some time
To get you off my mind
And forget how happy we once were
I don't know how to bring you back
And as a matter of fact
The only thing I know for sure
Is that they should have made tail lights blue
So when I see them go
They'll look the way I do
Just a pale blue glow
They should have made I can't stay
Sound like I love you
You know they should have made tail lights blue
They should have made tail lights blue
So when I see them go
They'll look the way I do
Just a pale blue glow
They should have made I can't stay
Sound like I love you
I could get used to you everyday
I've had romance a time or two
And that ain't fun for anyone
I could get used to you everyday
I like the way you make me feel
I never once said I love you
Until I felt the one that's true
I could get used to you everyday
I could get used to you everyday
I could get used to you everyday
If I never see your loving face again
I'll go on loving you till the end
I'll go on loving you till the end
The years and miles may separate you from me
The pain may lessen more as time goes by
But as for me your memories will never fade
And I'll go on loving you till the end
If we're ever free to love again I know
Straight back to your waiting arms is where I'll go
And I'll stay forever and I'll prove to you again
I'll go on loving you till the end
When the frantic pace of life attacks me
And weighs me to the ground
I long for someplace to escape
To the one place I have found
No stoplights to obey
No signs or limits there
And make your home almost anywhere
Where the sky meets the water
Where the wind is my song
Where the sun is my brother
That's where I belong
The gentle motion of the seas
Just rocks me off to sleep
Just quiet ocean breeze
A frigate bird encircles me
She dips her wing and bows her head
Like we share a common love
Where the sky meets the water
Where the wind is my song
Where the sun is my brother
That's where I belong
When the moonlight cracks the edge of night
And stars are everywhere
I can taste the rum and coke
And I can smell that salty air
A light spray across my bow
Cools the evening sun
As it slowly melts into the sea
And tells me day is done
Where the sky meets the water
Where the wind is my song
Where the sun is my brother
That's where I belong
When the common themes of life
They come and overload my brain
I steer my thoughts right to that place
That takes me far away
When the traffic fills that concrete path
That takes me back and forth
I usually sit and dream about
That biggest piece of earth
Where the sky meets the water
Where the wind is my song
Where the sun is my brother
That's where I belong
Where the sky meets the water
Where the wind is my song
Where the sun is my brother
That's where I belong
Oh I'm blessed and I know I am
God has dealt me a winning hand
A loving woman and a fairy land for me
Oh and I can't believe it half the time
When I look at her in perfect light
Sweet vision every day and night I see
My baby has big green eyes
Brighter than the bluest sky
Softer than an angel flies
Sweeter than a lullaby
And she loves me without design
Her picture never leaves my mind
I don't deserve a love this fine
Baby and her big green eyes
Oh and I'm never very far away
Even if I'm in another place
Her smile you can't erase from me
My baby has big green eyes
Brighter than the bluest sky
Softer than an angel flies
Sweeter than a lullaby
And she loves me without design
Her picture never leaves my mind
I don't deserve a love this fine
Baby and her big green eyes
Oh and I'm thankful every waking hour
For the love of a gentle flower
A face I will never tire or leave
My baby has big green eyes
Brighter than the bluest sky
Softer than an angel flies
Sweeter than a lullaby
And she loves me without design
Her picture never leaves my mind
I don't deserve a love this fine
Baby and her big green eyes
Her picture never leaves my mind
I don't deserve a love this fine
True love is a golden ring
Like the vows we made it's a precious thing
Sent from above on silver wings
True love is a golden ring
Down a winding road with many turns
Through fire and smoke and bridges burned
I've held my share of stranger's hands
True love is a golden ring
Like the vows we made it's a precious thing
Sent from above on silver wings
True love is a golden ring
Like the endless turn of a wedding band
Looking in your eyes I see the truth
After all this time I found you
True love is a golden ring
Like the vows we made it's a precious thing
Sent from above on silver wings
True love is a golden ring
We started out and life was perfect
I never thought our love would change
But years of ups and downs made a difference
It's not the same as it was yesterday
I don't treat you like I used to
You don't look the same into my eyes
We thought the best would be behind us
But the best keeps getting better all the time
We learned how to love and how to make up
And found what it takes to be enough
The best keeps getting better all the time
I love you now more than ever
And you appreciate me more today
The best keeps getting better all the time
We learned how to love and how to make up
And found what it takes to be enough
The best keeps getting better all the time
The best keeps getting better all the time
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
I fell in a ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I need to place an ad with you today
Tomorrow may be too late
I'd like to have it started right away
I'm not buying or selling anything
I know just what to say
One good hearted woman
In the man that she loves
Just one chance to tell her
How much he still loves her
He can't be sorry enough
I just hope these few lines will get to her
I hope she comes back when she reads these words
One good hearted woman
In the man that she loves
Just one chance to tell her
How much he still loves her
He can't be sorry enough
He tuned it to a country show
To the crying of a steel guitar
Mama used to sing to me
She taught me that sweet harmony
I'd ever really take it this far
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
An atlas and a coffee cup
Five pickers and an old Dodge truck
For a show on Saturday night
It makes this thing I'm doing seem right
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
He won it thirty years ago
I made it up to music row
Still I wouldn't trade a minute
I wouldn't have it any other way
Just show me to the stage
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
Has it been ten years
I've always heard marriage
Made one seem like two
But you're looking better
Than you did back then
You still make this old heart give in
And if I had it to do all over
I'd do it all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again
The preacher man said
That seemed like forever
To a young man's heart
Now the days seem much shorter
And the memories just keep adding up
And if I had it to do all over
I'd do it all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
For the Rolling Stones
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Before you drop that quarter
Keep one thing in mind
You got a heartbroke hillbilly
Standing here in line
I've been down and lonely
Before you punch that number
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
For the Rolling Stones
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Against rock and roll
But when your heart's been broken
You need a song that's slow
And don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear George Jones
For the Rolling Stones
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
She looked me in the eye and said it's over
She said don't tell me lies and try to please me
I've heard it all so many times before
And I took her by the arm and said don't leave me
And somewhere deep inside me I still do
Dallas packed her suitcase
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her
She made leaving me look easy
I wish she'd made it look a little harder
I took her out of Texas
When she was just a girl
But old Tennessee and me
Couldn't take Texas out of her
On how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
If Dallas was in Tennessee
By now she's leaving Memphis
And everything we had behind her
Will serve as a reminder
That true love is a treasure
That's very seldom found
But you can't stay together if there's no common ground
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
If Dallas was in Tennessee
Dallas packed her suitcase
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
I called my doctor on the telephone
I can't eat and I can't sleep
I told my buddies I was settling down
They looked at me like I was a fool
I can't eat and I can't sleep
There ain't nothing I can do
I can't eat and I can't sleep
Sounds like love's got a hold on you
Sounds like love's got a hold on you
The minute that she waltzed right through that door
Now she's with somebody new out on that floor
And she's got the rhythm and I got the blues
She's got the rhythm and I've got the blues
As she spells out regret in perfect time
She's got the rhythm and I got the blues
Our room was filled with silence
I guess we'd said it all
I don't know when I'd seen our bedroom
So long I can't recall
We'd built this thing between us
I'm not sure what's the cause
So I swallowed all my pride
And tonight I climbed the wall
Tonight I climbed the wall
And took her by the hand
We'd come too far to fall
Couldn't stand to see it end
So tonight I climbed the wall
When you love the one you hold
You'd think by now I'd know
Now as we lie here together
All our troubles seem so small
Just these satin sheets between us
Tonight I climbed the wall
And took her by the hand
We'd come too far to fall
Couldn't stand to see it end
So tonight I climbed the wall
Tonight I climbed the wall
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught
Down by the river on a Friday night
Pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
There's one lonely pillow on my double bed
My room's decorated with pictures of you
Your letters wallpaper this shrine to the blues
I've got precious memories at my beck and call
I've got everything a broken heart needs
I've got everything a broken heart needs
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nations
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Two young people without a thing
Say some vows and spread their wings
And settle down with just what they need
She just likes the way he smiles
It takes more than marble and tile
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Two old people without a thing
Children gone but still they sing
Side by side on that front porch swing
She can barely sweep the floor
Hand in hand they'll walk through that door
It doesn't take much when you get enough
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Every night she looks in the mirror and she only ages
So she packs her bags to try her hand
But the bills are piling up and the pop scene just ain't on the rally
Be back in the money in no time at all
Everybody's gone country
Well I was sitting in a roadhouse down on Highway 41
You were wiping off some ketchup on a table that was done
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
And I asked you for a date and then I asked to tie the knot
And I finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car
The last thing I remember I heard myself say
I've never been too good with all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
Standing by a woman in a long white lacy veil
I raised the veil and she smiled at me without her left front tooth
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
I never thought my love life would quite turn out this way
If you wanna drive a big limousine
I'll buy the longest one you've ever seen
If you wanna own a great big mansion
Well I'll give it my utmost attention
It may take a while but I'll prove that it's true
If it's money you want then I'll get it
If you wanna take a trip across the ocean
I'll travel anywhere you take a notion
If you wanna own a great big mansion
It may take a while but I'll prove it's true
If it's money you want then I'll get it
We never spoke a word
But every thought she had I heard from across the room
If we were standing face to face
I couldn't find the words to say give me one more move
I don't even know her name
I guess foolish pride's to blame
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
And my heart won't tell my mind to tell my mouth what it should say
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
Wise man next to me did say
Don't you let regret take place
Of the dreams you have to chase
You might fall down on your face
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
When your heart won't tell your mind to tell your mouth what it should say
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith
When your heart won't tell your mind to tell your mouth what it should say
It's driving my heart crazy
Like I've done before
Then I fall a little farther
Every time you look at me
The first time in your arms I knew
I went out of my mind
Then I fall a little farther
Every time you look at me
I'll take the sunshine over the rain
But I can swear that in every way that
But I will give you all that I am
In small town down in Georgia
Until she met that Jackson boy
They married young like folks did then
Not a penny to their name
They believed the one you vowed to love
Should always stay the same
And on the land his daddy gave him
A foundation underway
For a love to last forever
Or until their dying day
They built a bond that's strong enough
To stand the test a time
And a place for us to turn to
When our lives were in bind
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
And taught us right from wrong
In this world that I'll call home
My mama raised five children
She found her strength in faith of God
She never had a social life
Home was all she knew
Except the time she took a job
And my daddy skinned his knuckles
On the cars that he repaired
He never earned much money
But he gave us all he had
He never made the front page
But he did the best he could
Folks drove the cars from miles around
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
And taught us right from wrong
In this world that I'll call home
There'll never be another place
Have a little love on a little honeymoon
You got a little dish and you got a little spoon
A little bitty house and a little bitty yard
A little bitty dog and a little bitty car
A little hometown or a big old city
Life goes on for a little bitty while
A little bitty baby in a little bitty gown
It'll grow up in a little bitty town
A big yellow bus and little bitty books
It all started with a little bitty look
A little hometown or a big old city
Life goes on for a little bitty while
You know you got a job and a little bitty check
A six pack of beer and television set
Little bitty world goes around and around
Little bit of silence and a little bit of sound
Start all over in a little bitty world
Little bitty plan and a little bitty dream
It's all part of a little bitty scheme
It's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Life goes on for a little bitty while
It's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Life goes on for a little bitty while
On the trouble of a woman and a man
But you can not impose
You can't stick your nose
Into something that you don't understand
And who don't even care anymore
And who's car is parked next door
I thought I knew her well
I really couldn't tell
That she had another lover on her mind
You see it felt so right
When she held me tight
How could I be so blind
And who don't even care anymore
Who's car is parked next door
A heart is on the line
Love is stolen in the shadows of the night
Though it's wrong all along
Who don't even care anymore
Who's car is parked next door
And who don't even care anymore
Who's car is parked next door
And who don't even care anymore
Well I just looked where I don't see
Like some big black widow spider
You know just how to catch your prey
And you sneak up from behind and whisper my name
And there go the words I meant to say
There go the games I wanted to play
You like to see what you can do
And there go the words I meant to say
There go the games I wanted to play
This world can take you by the hand
And tempt the soul of any man
But you can choose your path
There's two roads you can take
One way is right and one way is wrong
And she's all I see between the devil and me
But through the smoke I see her there
She's all I see between the devil and me
I hold her in my arms tonight
So safe and warm I close my eyes
Outside her reach is my concern
Somewhere I know a fire burns
And she's all I see between the devil and me
But through the smoke I see her there
She's all I see between the devil and me
The gates of hell swing open wide
Let's begin with the day I met her
How fast this good old boys world got better
Just the first few seconds after I first seen her
My best old jeans and my broken sneakers
Sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
She's the best cook that's ever melted cheese
There's absolutely no reason to doubt it
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
First I get cold and hot
There's nothing I can do
All that I want is you
Look what I'm going through
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
Something is wrong or right
I think of you all night
Seeing you in my dreams
Holding you close to me
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
Barney stopped me with his gun
Ten minutes after midnight
I don't know about that accent son
Just where did you come from
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Well I was south of Detroit City
I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue
I'll be honest with you ma'am
It ain't like mama fixed it
It's cornbread and chicken
Somewhere around Ventura
I lost a universal joint and I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked
If I had plans for dinner
We like the girls that sing soprano
It's cornbread and chicken
Well I was headed home on 65
Somewhere around Kentucky
The CB rang for the bobtail rig
Well I answered him and he asked me
Aren't you from out in Tulsa
I just dropped a load of salsa
Where I come from It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from It's cornbread and chicken
Yeah where I come from
Yeah where I come from
Get back down there sometimes
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
And the greatest is love
Teaching a class full of innocent children
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
And the greatest is love
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
you the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love
It was painted red the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
It was just an old plywood boat
With a 75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
Just a little lake cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive
Just an old half ton short bed ford
My Uncle bought new in 64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal
It was just an old hand me down ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower son
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
When Daddy let me drive
3 daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
It's just an old plywood boat
Remember when I was young and so were you
Remember when we vowed the vows and walked the walk
Remember when old ones died and new were born
Was the music we danced to week to week
Remember when thirty seemed so old
When the children grow up and move away
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when
Born the middle son of a farmer
And a small town Southern man
Like his daddy's daddy before him
Fell in love with a small town woman
And they married up and settled down
For a small town Southern man
First there came four pretty daughters
For this small town Southern man
Then a few years later came another
In a house built with his own hands
From a small town Southern man
And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He was always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man
Callous hands told the story
For this small town Southern man
He gave it all to keep it all together
And keep his family on his land
Made it hard just to walk and stand
You can break the back
But you can't break the spirit
Of a small town Southern man
And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He's always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man
For this small town Southern man
And they got me by the hand
I'm blessed and I know I am
And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
That's when all the conditions are right
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
It's time for a good time
Pick up my baby and turn it around
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
Rowdy friends all night long
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
It's time for a good time
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
It's time for a good time
Sweet southern woman set on my lap
T with an I and an M and an E
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
That spells good time
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
Head for that Waffle House way across town
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
It's time for a good time
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
It's time for a good time
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
It's time for a good time
I can get you where you need to go
In the woods or right uptown
I can get you where you need to go
I can get you where you need to go
I can get you where you need to go
I can get you where you need to go
Let me just say for the sake of conversation
If there's such a thing as reincarnation
In the middle of a fiddle and a steel guitar
I'm gonna come back as a country song
I don't have to say it'd be Heaven to me
So go ahead and put it on my headstone
In the middle of a fiddle and a steel guitar
I'm gonna come back as a country song
So here I am on a stool tonight
I'm gonna come back as a country song
In the middle of a fiddle and a steel guitar
I'm gonna come back as a country song
All your pretty bags are packed
Forever sure did go by fast
I hope you find the skies are blue
The grass is green and the road is smooth
Who knows you might just maybe
It ain't about who's right or wrong
Love dies and life goes on
I poured some bourbon in a coffee cup
It's been too long since I drank too much
So here's to me and here's to the moon
And here's to love that ends too soon
Who knows you might just maybe
It ain't about who's right or wrong
Love dies and life goes on
Love dies and life goes on
Had a good thing but now it's long gone baby
It's hard to describe
So selfless and complete
And beauty in and out
I know heaven wonders where you are
When I'm with you I feel like a king
Just like out of some old movie scene
It's hard to believe that you could feel the way I do
Never thought I'd find so much love to fall into
If heaven calls you back just ask if you can stay
I'll never find someone to ever take your place
You know they only made a few
I know heaven wonders where you are
When I'm with you I feel like a king
Just like out of some old movie scene
Everything but the wings
Talk about do and talk about don't
Talk about will and talk about won't
Talk about being free
When I walk out you can slam the door
So you don't have to love me anymore
So you don't have to love me anymore
I will keep all those memories of the good times
Yeah there were some good times
So when you think of you and me
They won't even cross your mind
That you want what we had before
So you don't have to love me anymore
Yeah I will keep all those memories of the good times
Yeah there were some good times
So when you think of you and me
They won't even cross your mind
If you need me to make you cry
I don't want to but I'll try
Just look her in the eye and lie
Just look her in the eye and lie
Red clay and Georgia pines
Out on the highway 34
Red clay and Georgia pines
Red clay and Georgia pines
She don't get high anymore
She don't get high anymore
She don't get high anymore
She don't get high anymore
And she listens closely to the beats and the parts
She likes the songs that make her cry
And ones that pick her up and make her high
She even likes the ones where they just talk in rhyme and riddles
And she likes the songs that take her back and make her want
Sometimes she just wants to dance and move on
She taps her feet or sheds a tear
Plays air guitar or raises a beer
She even likes the ones where they just talk in rhyme and riddles
At times it seems they know just how she feels
A broken heart or a love song that kills
She even likes the ones where they just talk in rhyme and riddles
She even likes the ones where they just talk in rhyme and riddles
No plans and that's just fine
Just put your hand in mine
Don't need no party dress
I like you just like this
Just like the night we met
There's nothing you could do
To make me want you more
So I hope it's still okay
That when I feel this way
There's nothing you could do
To make me want you more
So I hope it's still okay
That when I feel this way
Well I drove down to the ocean
Left my heartache way behind
But the rain won't leave and the pain won't ease
And the sun don't wanna shine
So I ordered me up a killer
Found a view out across the sea
I got a bug in my margarita
Seems bad luck won't leave me alone
Well I met an old boy from Georgia
And the sun don't wanna shine
And there's something in the bottom of this drink I just got
And it don't look like a worm to me
I got a bug in my margarita
Seems bad luck won't leave me alone
And the women that had done us wrong
And we both sang a happy song
I got a bug in my margarita
Seems bad luck won't leave me alone
Seems bad luck won't leave me alone
Seems bad luck won't leave me alone
I'm the poorest old boy that you will ever see
When the clouds roll in and the sun won't shine
Now my dollar bills ain't worth a dime
But I drank a pot of coffee and I'm on the run
Yeah that old rat race it ain't no fun
I've got a mountain of debt to crawl out from under
But one of these days I'm gonna hit the numbers
I'm all ground down to the bottom of the ground
That saved a wretch like me
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun
That saved a wretch like me
And just the time I need Him He's always near
He walks with me and talks with me
Along life's narrow way
He lives within my heart
In all the world around me I see His loving care
And though my heart grows weary I never will despair
The day of His appearing will come at last
He lives He lives Christ Jesus lives today
He walks with me and talks with me
Along life's narrow way
He lives He lives Salvation to impart
He lives within my heart
He lives He lives Christ Jesus lives today
He walks with me and talks with me
Along life's narrow way
He lives He lives Salvation to impart
But that Thy blood was shed for me
Fightings and fears within without
To rid my soul of one dark blot
To thee whose blood can cleanse each spot
Because Thy promise I believe
Because Thy promise I believe
Love lifted me Love lifted me
When nothing else could help
Love lifted me Love lifted me
When nothing else could help
Ever to Him I'll cling
Love lifted me Love lifted me
When nothing else could help
Love lifted me Love lifted me
When nothing else could help
Love lifted me Love lifted me
When nothing else could help
Love lifted me Love lifted me
When nothing else could help
There is a name I love to hear
I love to sing its worth
It sounds like music in mine ear
The sweetest name on earth
Because He first loved me
It tells me of a Savior's love
Who died to set me free
It tells me of His precious blood
The sinner's perfect plea
Because He first loved me
It tells of One whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe
Who in each sorrow bears a part
That none can bear below
Because He first loved me
There's mercy with the Lord
And He will surely give you rest
By trusting in His Word
For Jesus shed His precious blood
Rich blessings to bestow
Plunge now into the crimson flood
That washes white as snow
That leads you into rest
Believe in Him without delay
And you are fully blessed
There's wonderful power in the blood
In the blood of the Lamb
In the precious blood of the Lamb
Would you be free from your passion and pride
Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide
There's wonderful power in the blood
In the blood of the Lamb
In the precious blood of the Lamb
There's wonderful power in the blood
In the blood of the Lamb
In the precious blood of the Lamb
Sent from somewhere to my soul
And the sacred past unfolds
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appears
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
Precious sacred scenes unfold
I remember Mother praying
But their prayers still follow me
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
Precious sacred scenes unfold
That calls me from a world of care
And bids me at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes known
In seasons of distress and grief
My soul has often found relief
Of those whose anxious spirits burn
With strong desires for Thy return
With such I hasten to the place
Where God my Savior shows His face
And gladly take my station there
When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more
And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair
When the saved word shall gather over on the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
On that bright and cloudless morning
When the dead in Christ shall rise
And the glory of his resurrection share
When His chosen ones shall gather
To their home beyond the skies
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder
Take up thy cross and follow Me
I heard my Master say
I gave My life to ransom thee
Surrender your all today
Wherever He leads I'll go
Wherever He leads I'll go
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so
Wherever He leads I'll go
He drew me closer to His side
I sought His will to know
And in that will I now abide
Wherever He leads I'll go
Wherever He leads I'll go
Wherever He leads I'll go
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so
Wherever He leads I'll go
To Christ who loves me so
Wherever He leads I'll go
Wherever He leads I'll go
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so
Wherever He leads I'll go
Seems forever I've been gone
Lord I need to find my way back home
I hear the voice my sweet momma called me
Telling me to change my ways
Takes me back to yesterday
Seems forever I've been gone
Lord I need to find my way back home
I left behind the person that I once was
I changed for good and some for bad
I've wasted days and nights on love forgotten
I've traded happiness for sad
Seems forever I've been gone
Lord I need to find my way back home
I've felt the hurt of a broken heart inside me
I've felt the joy of love unchained
I've seen the rain wash away a mountain
Like tears have washed away my pain
Seems forever I've been gone
Lord I need to find my way back home
I've watched some loved ones dear to my heart dying
I've heard a newborn baby's cry
I've walked a path of glory and of darkness
I've felt the guilt of a senseless life
Seems forever I've been gone
Lord I need to find my way back home
Drank to forget and I've drank to remember
And I've drank for love and I've drank for hate
I've danced alone with a full moon up above me
Lighting the way to heaven's gate
Seems forever I've been gone
Lord I need to find my way back home
I've felt the love of Jesus shining on me
I've felt the devil's wicked ways
Prayed just to make it through the day
Seems forever I've been gone
How did you end up in my life
You chose me to lay down with at night
Colors of spring are vivid and green
Since I looked so deep in your eyes
With feelings I used to deny
How did you end up in my life
You chose me to lay down with at night
You've given me purpose and reason to worship
Someone much stronger than me
The little things a man really needs
How did you end up in my life
You chose me to lay down with at night
To each other till they lay me down
To hold me when you're not around
How did you end up in my life
Way across town a phone rings off the wall
You're gonna drive yourself crazy and you know that it's true
It's just making you wild and blue
Wild and blue it's no wonder
You look at the things that you do
You're already wild and blue
In somebody's room on the far side of town
With your minds all made up and the shades all pulled down
Someone is trying just to satisfy you
He don't know you're wild and you're blue
Wild and blue it's no wonder
You look at the things that you do
You're already wild and blue
It's four in the morning and you're all alone
With no place to go you know you ought to come home
I know you've been wild and blue
Wild and blue and it's no wonder
You look at the things that you do
You're already wild and blue
Beneath the floor and never greens
That kept the ridge on high
That stoled my heart one night
She loved me like I never know
And chased me down below
To never feel her touch again
Or taste that mountain snow
That Appalachian Mountain Girl that haunts me from above
My heart will never beat the same without her mountain love
I often wakeup late at night
Dreaming of about her
Then walked on floor till morning comes
And hope she will return
That Appalachian Mountain Girl that haunts me from above
My heart will never beat the same without her mountain love
Sometimes the wind will blow just right
And I think I can smell
The flowers that headlined the road
That led me to this hell
That Appalachian Mountain Girl that haunts me from above
She finally ran off with a boy from the city
And I ain't got trouble now
I ain't got trouble now
No I ain't got trouble now
But I ain't got trouble now
For the meanest man in town
And I ain't got trouble now
I ain't got trouble now
No I ain't got trouble now
But I ain't got trouble now
And I ain't got trouble now
I ain't got trouble now
No I ain't got trouble now
But I ain't got trouble now
And there ain't no girls in this town
And I ain't got trouble now
I ain't got trouble now
No I ain't got trouble now
They were deep in love by June
Hand in hand beneath that moon
And she sang a little blue ridge mountain song
And he'd just hum along
And they'd dance all night till dawn
On a hillside all alone
They were young and they were free
Like a mountain melody
In love as they could be
Singing that blue ridge song
She married in her mama's wedding gown
Bought a house and settled down
He worked driving all around
All at large from town to town
And he'd come home every night
And she'd be waiting in the front porch light
And she'd sing a little blue ridge mountain song
And he'd just hum along
And they'd dance all night till dawn
On the front porch all alone
They were young and they were free
Like a mountain melody
In love as they could be
Singing that blue ridge song
They couldn't tell him what was wrong
But they just didn't know
It wasn't very long until Jesus called her home
And he got down on his knees
Just let her sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Like she has all along
And I'll dance with her till dawn
On a hill side all alone
And we'll spend eternity like a mountain melody
Singing that blue ridge song
Now he lives there all alone
In the house that they call home
In his heart there lies a void
From the absence of her voice
And he lays down every night
Dreams about that front porch light
Where she sang a little blue ridge mountain song
And he'd just hum along
And they'd dance all night until dawn
On the hillside all alone
They were young and they were free
Like a mountain melody
In love as they could be
Singing that blue ridge song
Little blue ridge mountain song
Singing that blue ridge song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Singing that blue ridge song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Singing that blue ridge song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Sing a little blue ride mountain song
Those sweet lips and eyes of green cut me like a blade of steel
Pull my heart like an eighteen wheel running up a Tennessee hill
She was the only one that ever could tie me down
She was the only one that ever could tie me down
She was the only one that ever could tie me down
She was the only one that ever could tie me down
She was the only one that ever could tie me down
There is a time for love and laughter
The days will pass like summer storms
The winter wind will follow after
But there is love and love is warm
There is a time for us to wander
When time is young and so are we
The woods are greener over yonder
The path is new the world is free
There is a time when leaves are falling
The woods are gray the paths are old
You need a fire against the cold
There is a time for us to wander
When time is young and so are we
The woods are greener over yonder
The path is new the world is free
So do your roaming in the springtime
You'll find your love and summer sun
Frost will come and bring a harvest
And you can sleep when the day is done
There is a time for us to wander
When time is young and so are we
The woods are greener over yonder
The path is new the world is free
The path is new the world is free
There is a time for us to wander
When time is young and so are we
The woods are greener over yonder
And I'll take you with my soul's memory
I'm just going ahead to tell them about you
So they will all know you the way that I do
And I'll meet you dear on the blue side of heaven
Where angels sing and days never end
And I'll dance with you on the blue side of heaven
Where God will bless our love once again
I'll teach them all the songs that we love dear
And I'll tell them of our babies at home
I'll hug and kiss all of our loved ones
Who came before so I'm not alone
And I'll meet you dear on the blue side of heaven
Where angels sing and days never end
And I'll dance with you on the blue side of heaven
Where God will bless our love once again
So let me go and tell me you love me
That someday soon you'll be there with me
We'll be together as long as time goes
And I'll meet you dear on the blue side of heaven
Where angels sing and days never end
And I'll dance with you on the blue side of heaven
Where God will bless our love once again
So don't be sad you know that I love you
And I'll see you when it comes to your time
We'll walk along some beautiful river
I'm always on the road
You're always all alone
And I'm not always there when I'm at home
But I'm ready for a little change
I'm ready to accept some blame
So let's back up to yesterday
Let's get back in love
All those little things we used to do
When all we had was enough
Well I don't like the blues
I like love that's true
Let's get back in love
All those little things we used to do
Let's get back in love
All those little things we used to do
Let's get back in love
All those little things we used to do
Streets of heaven are pave with gold
If heaven has anything like your love
I believe I'll be up in above a time or two
If sometimes love is like a falling star
Before it breaks your heart in two
The things you taught me just a little while
Would've taken me a hundred years
Without somebody like you here
But I didn't know it was gonna be today
I remember the places that we've been
The little things we used to do
Looking back now that's when I began
To realize that I'm a lot like you
But I didn't know it was gonna be today
Friends and family help to pass the time
I'm thumbing through pictures of you
That's not what you'd want me to do
But I didn't know it was gonna be today
Simpler times or easy ways
Oh how I long for an old dirt road
Greener grass or a lighter load
I was glad to see the blacktop
Yeah I was glad to see the blacktop
No more dust in my eyes
Rain would fall and the mud would rise
Through my toes in the summertime
All those teen would drive and play
Dust would fly like a dandelion
I was glad to see the blacktop
Yeah I was glad to see the blacktop
No more dust in my eyes
I stomp my toes on rocks and stones
Slept in fairy mo park homes
Watch my momma shake that line
Dusting clothes off hanging in a hot sunshine
I was glad to see the blacktop
Yeah I was glad to see the blacktop
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Don't be afraid to try
The world can be hard
Step out in the bright sunshine
And remember any time
You can always come home
To a love that's strong and free
You'll never be alone
In your heart there's still a place
No matter how right or wrong you've gone
You can always come home
Smile and say goodbye
And chase those dreams
And when you lay down at night
You know that there's someone
Praying for you every day
Even if you never find your way
You can always come home
You can always come home
To a love that's strong and free
You'll never be alone
In your heart there's still a place
No matter how right or wrong you've gone
You can always come home
And I took those words with me
I'd pull them out and think
Just how much they mean to me
You can always come home
To a love that's strong and free
You'll never be alone
In your heart there's still a place
No matter how right or wrong you've gone
You can let a gal with freckles on her face
Caught my eye like a little red car
She shook my hand and she grabbed my heart
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door
Brunette hair and big brown eyes
Waiting on her table with her lazy anchor on
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door
I was down in Atlanta on a Sunday afternoon
Backed into a Honda with a woman dressed in blue
First she wasn't happy but the chemistry began
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door
So the moral to the story is you better be aware
So keep your motor running and keep it in gear
Listen real close she might just whisper in your ear
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door
You can't mix angels and alcohol
I don't think God meant for them to get along
You can't mix angels and alcohol
You can't blend whiskey with a good woman's love
You can't blend whiskey with a good woman's love
You can't change lonely with a bottle of wine
It might ease the heartache for one short easy time
In the end you have to face what's hiding in your mind
You can't change lonely with a bottle of wine
You can't mix angels and alcohol
I let the bottle drive my life into a wall
I had a dream last night
I was floating down that black water
Kick back on the Mississippi
He got restless down around Memphis
That's where he left me
Said I'm one rambling man
I was gone before you met me
And there I was back in my hometown
That's just how dreams go
Thumb in the air wanted out of there
Well I hitched a ride with this beatnik guy
Said looks like you read me
My name is Jack Kerouac
I was gone before you met me
With boys like me your bound to run the wild side
Like the restless wind you'll never catch me
I was gone before you met me
And just before I awoke
I had a bad nightmare
I was on some lost highway and you were nowhere near
Someone took your hand I wasn't that man
I was cussing fate but it was too late
You were gone before you met me
I heard you singing in the kitchen
Thank God I'm still driven
His restless heart found a heart I can call mine
I was smart enough to let love catch me
Does he make enough and then some
Does he miss you every minute that he's gone
Does he tell you that you're pretty
The one you're waiting on
And every guy here's trying to buy you
Swirling your glass on the table
The one you're waiting on
How many glasses of Cabernet
How many minutes slip away
How many times were you gonna check your phone
I'm telling you if you were mine
You wouldn't be sitting here counting the time
You'd never spend a single moment alone
I bet he don't get how lucky he is
The one you're waiting on
How many glasses of Cabernet
How many boys can you turn away
The one you're waiting on
Hey you were standing by the screen door slamming
Rather clear what's taking place
You were holding on to Louie
That plastic handle just about to break
Well then you picked up Chloe
She knew y'all were going
She started barking like a tank
I was shocked and I was joking
But I would not be longing
Take what's left there in the bank
Take your flat iron and your curlers
Your sparkling water and that damn perfume I never liked
Take your black Mercedes all that stuff for ladies
To me you're just a total blank
Go on and leave me baby
Well now you left screaming and your tires screeching
That little dog right in your lap
I have become a little sad and I called up my old dad
He said son you just woke me from my nap
I told him you had left me
He said now son don't you hate me
You know exactly what I think
You know you're better off
You can fish and you can golf
You still got Jim and Jack and Hank
Take what's left there in the bank
Take your flat iron and your curlers
Your sparkling water and that damn perfume I never liked
Take your black Mercedes all that stuff for ladies
To me you're just a total blank
Go on and leave me baby
To songs out in my truck you couldn't crank
I started feeling empty
I've got Jim and Jack and Hank
Take what's left there in the bank
Take your flat iron and your curlers
Your sparkling water and that damn perfume I never liked
Take your black Mercedes all that stuff for ladies
To me you're just a total blank
Go on and leave me baby
Yeah now go on and leave me baby
How about Old Jimmy Buffet bring him in there when it's sun shining
George Strait an old friend
Can't forget Hank Jr and all his rowdy friends
But sometimes I can't find the reason to be free
So I leave a light on for your memory
I leave a light on for your memory
So it will be easy to come back to me
I leave a light on for your memory
You found a new love and I'd like to believe
That you're really better off without me
The good days have slipped away but I sometimes dream
So I leave a light on for your memory
I leave a light on for your memory
So it will be easy to come back to me
I leave a light on for your memory
You can bet your last two dollars
One's you can't weather you caused them
Scars or tattoo's that went rotten
I know her best than anyone I guess
And all the little parts that are unique
You can bet your last two dollars
One's you can't weather you caused them
Scars or tattoo's that went rotten
Left higher than the right
I guess that's just the way I'm supposed to be
The pieces of the puzzle that I am
You can bet your last two dollars
One's you can't weather you caused them
Scars or tattoo's that went rotten
We all got them flaws
Cause everyone has something they don't like
We're all perfect in the eyes that see
You can bet your last two dollars
One's you can't weather you caused them
Scars or tattoo's that went rotten
We all got them flaws
Everybody's got a few flaws
He colors every feather on a sparrows wings
I can be as big as critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain
And I've learned that sometimes
It's not always black and white but well defined
I can be as big as critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain
And I reach across the canvas and I take your hand
And my world is so complete
I can be as big as critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain
I pray I always see the beauty inside the frame
Halfway bound to New Orleans
Rolling through the levee's trying to get to where I wanna be
When I'm looking back at Texas
That's where I reckon I can finally put myself at ease
Check my life there at the border
Everything over my shoulder
Even tired of her sweet face
I'm sick of what I'm supposed to be
I need a little time to vegetate my mind
Escape from my reality
I'm not entirely unhappy
Make me wanna stop and run
Drift away beside the sea
Well my baby wants to hold me
The bank they want the payments
Sometimes they just can't take it
Got to find a place where I feel free
Halfway bound to New Orleans
Rolling through the levee's trying to get to where I wanna be
When I'm looking back at Texas
That's where I reckon I can finally put myself at ease
Check my life there at the border
Everything over my shoulder
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
She was raised uptown with a silver spoon
We had an old Ford tractor and a country moon
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
And I like my sushi southern fried
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
I need to place an ad with you today
Tomorrow may be too late
I'd like to have it started right away
I'm not buying or selling anything
I know just what to say
One good hearted woman
In the man that she loves
Just one chance to tell her
How much he still loves her
He can't be sorry enough
I just hope these few lines will get to her
I hope she comes back when she reads these words
One good hearted woman
In the man that she loves
Just one chance to tell her
How much he still loves her
He can't be sorry enough
He tuned it to a country show
To the crying of a steel guitar
Mama used to sing to me
She taught me that sweet harmony
I'd ever really take it this far
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
An atlas and a coffee cup
Five pickers and an old Dodge truck
For a show on Saturday night
It makes this thing I'm doing seem right
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
He won it thirty years ago
I made it up to music row
Still I wouldn't trade a minute
I wouldn't have it any other way
Just show me to the stage
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
Has it been ten years
I've always heard marriage
Made one seem like two
But you're looking better
Than you did back then
You still make this old heart give in
And if I had it to do all over
I'd do it all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again
The preacher man said
That seemed like forever
To a young man's heart
Now the days seem much shorter
And the memories just keep adding up
And if I had it to do all over
I'd do it all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
For the Rolling Stones
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Before you drop that quarter
Keep one thing in mind
You got a heartbroke hillbilly
Standing here in line
I've been down and lonely
Before you punch that number
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
For the Rolling Stones
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Against rock and roll
But when your heart's been broken
You need a song that's slow
And don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear George Jones
For the Rolling Stones
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
She looked me in the eye and said it's over
She said don't tell me lies and try to please me
I've heard it all so many times before
And I took her by the arm and said don't leave me
And somewhere deep inside me I still do
Dallas packed her suitcase
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her
She made leaving me look easy
I wish she'd made it look a little harder
I took her out of Texas
When she was just a girl
But old Tennessee and me
Couldn't take Texas out of her
On how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
If Dallas was in Tennessee
By now she's leaving Memphis
And everything we had behind her
Will serve as a reminder
That true love is a treasure
That's very seldom found
But you can't stay together if there's no common ground
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
If Dallas was in Tennessee
Dallas packed her suitcase
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
I called my doctor on the telephone
I can't eat and I can't sleep
I told my buddies I was settling down
They looked at me like I was a fool
I can't eat and I can't sleep
There ain't nothing I can do
I can't eat and I can't sleep
Sounds like love's got a hold on you
Sounds like love's got a hold on you
The minute that she waltzed right through that door
Now she's with somebody new out on that floor
And she's got the rhythm and I got the blues
She's got the rhythm and I've got the blues
As she spells out regret in perfect time
She's got the rhythm and I got the blues
Our room was filled with silence
I guess we'd said it all
I don't know when I'd seen our bedroom
So long I can't recall
We'd built this thing between us
I'm not sure what's the cause
So I swallowed all my pride
And tonight I climbed the wall
Tonight I climbed the wall
And took her by the hand
We'd come too far to fall
Couldn't stand to see it end
So tonight I climbed the wall
When you love the one you hold
You'd think by now I'd know
Now as we lie here together
All our troubles seem so small
Just these satin sheets between us
Tonight I climbed the wall
And took her by the hand
We'd come too far to fall
Couldn't stand to see it end
So tonight I climbed the wall
Tonight I climbed the wall
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught
Down by the river on a Friday night
Pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
I'd tell you what I'd do
I go downtown buy a Mercury or two
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
I stole her from a friend
He got lucky stole her back again
She heard he had a Mercury
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
Well my baby went out
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
I'd tell you what I'd do
I go downtown buy a Mercury or two
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
There's one lonely pillow on my double bed
My room's decorated with pictures of you
Your letters wallpaper this shrine to the blues
I've got precious memories at my beck and call
I've got everything a broken heart needs
I've got everything a broken heart needs
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nations
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Every night she looks in the mirror and she only ages
So she packs her bags to try her hand
But the bills are piling up and the pop scene just ain't on the rally
Be back in the money in no time at all
Everybody's gone country
I stare out the window at this long interstate
Sometimes I wonder just how we'll survive
For these modern days
I'm like an endangered species
Just captured by fate
I was just born too late
This built in computer tells me how far I've been
Another advancement of this age we live in
But it can't change a scenery or help me escape
The constant reminder that I was just born too late
I was just born too late
For these modern days
I'm like an endangered species
Just captured by fate
I was just born too late
I've watched you hide the pain too many times
Much too often you don't say what's in your heart
And your dresses from the closet down the hall
And if mirrors spoke they'd tell me I'm a fool
For never loving you the way I wanted to
And if silence says it all I guess it means our love has died
And if mirrors spoke they'd tell me I'm a fool
For never loving you the way I wanted to
And if silence says it all I guess it means our love has died
There are stars in the southern sky
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the seven bridges road.
Like some lonesome child
And I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild.
Sometimes there's a part of me
Has to turn form here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars
Down the seven bridges road.
There are stars in the southern sky
And if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of time sweetened honey
Two young people without a thing
Say some vows and spread their wings
And settle down with just what they need
She just likes the way he smiles
It takes more than marble and tile
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Two old people without a thing
Children gone but still they sing
Side by side on that front porch swing
She can barely sweep the floor
Hand in hand they'll walk through that door
It doesn't take much when you get enough
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Well I was sitting in a roadhouse down on Highway 41
You were wiping off some ketchup on a table that was done
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
And I asked you for a date and then I asked to tie the knot
And I finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car
The last thing I remember I heard myself say
I've never been too good with all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
Standing by a woman in a long white lacy veil
I raised the veil and she smiled at me without her left front tooth
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
I never thought my love life would quite turn out this way
If you wanna drive a big limousine
I'll buy the longest one you've ever seen
If you wanna own a great big mansion
Well I'll give it my utmost attention
It may take a while but I'll prove that it's true
If it's money you want then I'll get it
If you wanna take a trip across the ocean
I'll travel anywhere you take a notion
If you wanna own a great big mansion
It may take a while but I'll prove it's true
If it's money you want then I'll get it
I'll take the sunshine over the rain
But I can swear that in every way that
But I will give you all that I am
In small town down in Georgia
Until she met that Jackson boy
They married young like folks did then
Not a penny to their name
They believed the one you vowed to love
Should always stay the same
And on the land his daddy gave him
A foundation underway
For a love to last forever
Or until their dying day
They built a bond that's strong enough
To stand the test a time
And a place for us to turn to
When our lives were in bind
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
And taught us right from wrong
In this world that I'll call home
My mama raised five children
She found her strength in faith of God
She never had a social life
Home was all she knew
Except the time she took a job
And my daddy skinned his knuckles
On the cars that he repaired
He never earned much money
But he gave us all he had
He never made the front page
But he did the best he could
Folks drove the cars from miles around
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
And taught us right from wrong
In this world that I'll call home
There'll never be another place
Have a little love on a little honeymoon
You got a little dish and you got a little spoon
A little bitty house and a little bitty yard
A little bitty dog and a little bitty car
A little hometown or a big old city
Life goes on for a little bitty while
A little bitty baby in a little bitty gown
It'll grow up in a little bitty town
A big yellow bus and little bitty books
It all started with a little bitty look
A little hometown or a big old city
Life goes on for a little bitty while
You know you got a job and a little bitty check
A six pack of beer and television set
Little bitty world goes around and around
Little bit of silence and a little bit of sound
Start all over in a little bitty world
Little bitty plan and a little bitty dream
It's all part of a little bitty scheme
It's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Life goes on for a little bitty while
It's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Life goes on for a little bitty while
On the trouble of a woman and a man
But you can not impose
You can't stick your nose
Into something that you don't understand
And who don't even care anymore
And who's car is parked next door
I thought I knew her well
I really couldn't tell
That she had another lover on her mind
You see it felt so right
When she held me tight
How could I be so blind
And who don't even care anymore
Who's car is parked next door
A heart is on the line
Love is stolen in the shadows of the night
Though it's wrong all along
Who don't even care anymore
Who's car is parked next door
And who don't even care anymore
Who's car is parked next door
And who don't even care anymore
Well I just looked where I don't see
Like some big black widow spider
You know just how to catch your prey
And you sneak up from behind and whisper my name
And there go the words I meant to say
There go the games I wanted to play
You like to see what you can do
And there go the words I meant to say
There go the games I wanted to play
This world can take you by the hand
And tempt the soul of any man
But you can choose your path
There's two roads you can take
One way is right and one way is wrong
And she's all I see between the devil and me
But through the smoke I see her there
She's all I see between the devil and me
I hold her in my arms tonight
So safe and warm I close my eyes
Outside her reach is my concern
Somewhere I know a fire burns
And she's all I see between the devil and me
But through the smoke I see her there
She's all I see between the devil and me
The gates of hell swing open wide
We still wear our rings
We still say I love you
We both play the part oh so well
It's like living in a house with no curtains
The whole world can see what's inside
You can turn out the lights in a house with no curtains
But heartache has nowhere to hide
We could pack up and leave in different directions
If we just had somewhere to go
We just keep on pretending
Admitting what everyone knows
It's like living in a house with no curtains
The whole world can see what's inside
You can turn out the lights in a house with no curtains
But heartache has nowhere to hide
You can turn out the lights
In a house with no curtains
When I look into your soft green eyes
When I see your delicate body
Revealed to me as you slip off your dress
I'm reminded what I feel for you
Will remain strong and true
Long after the pleasures of the flesh
Then I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
Be it the wind or the rain
Or the moon up in the sky
The spin of the earth or the changes in the tide
I don't know what brought us together
What strange forces of nature
Conspire to construct the present
Then I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
When I look into your soft green eyes
When I see your delicate body
Revealed to me as you slip off your dress
I'm reminded what I feel for you
Will remain strong and true
Long after the pleasures of the flesh
Then I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
Let's begin with the day I met her
How fast this good old boys world got better
Just the first few seconds after I first seen her
My best old jeans and my broken sneakers
Sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
She's the best cook that's ever melted cheese
There's absolutely no reason to doubt it
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
Here I am alone again tonight
In this old empty house
Its hard to learn what you don't think you need
That you can't live without
Never leave the sound of the telephone
But ever since you left
I've asked myself the reasons
Going up and down this hall way
Trying to leave the pain behind
Never saw your face this many times
When you were really here
Things you said I never understood
Never spent this much time alone
But ever since you left
I've asked myself the reasons
Going up and down this hall way
Trying to leave the pain behind
They ware the little man
I go back now and the stores are empty
Except for an old coke sign dated 1950
Boarded up like they never existed
Or renovated and called historic districts
There goes the little man
There goes the little man
Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
And killed the little man
He pumped your gas and he cleaned your glass
And one cold rainy night he fixed your flat
The new stores came where you do it yourself
You buy a lotto ticket and food off the shelf
Forget the little man
Forget about that little man
He hung on there for a few more years
And he wouldn't sell beer
Now the bank rents the station
To a man down the road
And they sell velvet Elvis and
There goes little man
There goes another little man
Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
And killed the little man
Now the stores are lined up in a concrete strip
You can buy the whole world in just one trip
They don't even realize
Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
And killed the little man
It wasn't long ago when I was a child
An old black man came with his mule and his plow
He broke the ground where we grew our garden
Long live the little man
I've just got time for one more round
And you can let some other fool sit down
I'd like for you'd to listen to
Did you ever hear of a clown with tear
I think I'll have another round
And you can let some other fool sit down
Home for me is misery
And here I'm wasting time
Is not what's on my mind
But then you see her leaving me
It's not what I prefer
I think I'll have another round
And you can let some other fool sit down
Hey baby you ain't got to prove to me you're some kind of macho man
First I get cold and hot
There's nothing I can do
All that I want is you
Look what I'm going through
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
Something is wrong or right
I think of you all night
Seeing you in my dreams
Holding you close to me
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
Once upon a time I was blind
No one else could see it was clear to me
You wiped the pain from my eyes
Dried the tears that I cried
And your love gave me wings
Your love gave me wings
I can fly high through the storms that life brings
Cause your love gave me wings
I was chained and more restrained
With no one else trapped inside myself
But you loosened the binds
And your love gave me wings
Your love gave me wings
I can fly high through the storms that life brings
Cause your love gave me wings
Once upon a time I was blind
With no one else trapped inside myself
But your love gave me wings
Your love gave me wings
I can fly high through the storms that life brings
Cause your love gave me wings
Your love gave me wings
I can fly high through the storms that life brings
Cause your love gave me wings
Your love gave me wings
Your love gave me wings
Your love gave me wings
Your love gave me wings
Oh say can you see by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
Barney stopped me with his gun
Ten minutes after midnight
I don't know about that accent son
Just where did you come from
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Well I was south of Detroit City
I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue
I'll be honest with you ma'am
It ain't like mama fixed it
It's cornbread and chicken
Somewhere around Ventura
I lost a universal joint and I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked
If I had plans for dinner
We like the girls that sing soprano
It's cornbread and chicken
Well I was headed home on 65
Somewhere around Kentucky
The CB rang for the bobtail rig
Well I answered him and he asked me
Aren't you from out in Tulsa
I just dropped a load of salsa
Where I come from It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from It's cornbread and chicken
Yeah where I come from
Yeah where I come from
Get back down there sometimes
When your heart is all alone every second
But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
Play solitaire and stare at the phone
But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
So let's put aside our foolish pride
And let our hearts say hello
We both agree we're just no good
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
And the greatest is love
Teaching a class full of innocent children
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
And the greatest is love
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
you the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love
It was painted red the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
It was just an old plywood boat
With a 75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
Just a little lake cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive
Just an old half ton short bed ford
My Uncle bought new in 64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal
It was just an old hand me down ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower son
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
When Daddy let me drive
3 daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
It's just an old plywood boat
Okay I forgot about the trash
I didn't trim the long hairs on my mustache
All right I admit it I forgot our anniversary
That ain't no big thing but it's a gold star for me
You get tired and disgusted with me
When I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked the Lord to try to help me
He looked down from heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient I'm a work in progress
I read that book you gave me about Mars and Venus
You get tired and disgusted with me
When I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked the Lord to try to help me
He looked down from heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient I'm a work in progress
I know you meant well when you gave me those clogs
But my heels sure get hot down by the muffler on my hog
I'm sure they're stylish but I'll take my boots
I try to do that healthy thing like you want me to do
Now I love your cooking honey
But sometimes I need some real food
You get tired and disgusted with me
When I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked the Lord to try to help me
He looked down from heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient I'm a work in progress
Oh honey just be patient now
And time wasn't such a luxury
If love was lovesick over me
If I could keep the wind in my sails
Keep a hold of the tiger by the tail
A half a ham sandwich in my lunch pail
If everybody everywhere
Had a lighter load to bear
And a little bigger piece of the pie
And that'd be alright
Go heavy on the good and light on the bad
A hair more happy and a shade less sad
Turn all that negative down just a tad
If the family farm never got sold
If another bad joke never got told
If everybody everywhere
Had a lighter load to bear
And a little bigger piece of the pie
And that'd be alright
If everybody everywhere
Had a lighter load to bear
And a little bigger piece of the pie
And that'd be alright
If everybody everywhere
Had a lighter load to bear
And a little bigger piece of the pie
If everybody everywhere
Had a lighter load to bear
And a little bigger piece of the pie
And that'd be alright
Remember when I was young and so were you
Remember when we vowed the vows and walked the walk
Remember when old ones died and new were born
Was the music we danced to week to week
Remember when thirty seemed so old
When the children grow up and move away
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when
Smiles in the morning as warm as sunshine
Kisses when I lay down at night
And two loving arms to console me
I should be scared it's so right
Feelings like this can't be wrong
And we've got a good thing going on.
Some would say it's too perfect
But I don't think what we have is so bad.
Feelings like this can't be wrong
And we've got a good thing going on.
You left your bible on the dresser
So I put it in the drawer
Without yelling anymore
I can almost here those hymns
The keys are just collecting dust
But I can't close the lid.
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith
And now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
Things are only getting worse
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church.
The preacher came by Sunday
Said he missed me at the service
He told me Jesus loves me
But I'm not sure I deserve it
Is nowhere to be found
Since they took all that he believed
And laid it in the ground.
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith
And now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
Things are only getting worse
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church.
I still believe in Heaven
And I'm sure you've made it there
I don't have a prayer.
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith
And now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
Things are only getting worse
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church.
You left your bible on the dresser
When your lips first smiled at me
I was captured instantly
The gaze of your willing eyes
Touched something deep inside
That I love you like all little children love pennies
You're where I belong
And I love you like all little children love pennies
And I love you like good times of which I've known many
You make my blood flow
I'll never understand
All the little things
I'll never come Face to face
Born the middle son of a farmer
And a small town Southern man
Like his daddy's daddy before him
Fell in love with a small town woman
And they married up and settled down
For a small town Southern man
First there came four pretty daughters
For this small town Southern man
Then a few years later came another
In a house built with his own hands
From a small town Southern man
And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He was always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man
Callous hands told the story
For this small town Southern man
He gave it all to keep it all together
And keep his family on his land
Made it hard just to walk and stand
You can break the back
But you can't break the spirit
Of a small town Southern man
And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He's always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man
For this small town Southern man
And they got me by the hand
I'm blessed and I know I am
And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
That's when all the conditions are right
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
It's time for a good time
Pick up my baby and turn it around
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
Rowdy friends all night long
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
It's time for a good time
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
It's time for a good time
Sweet southern woman set on my lap
T with an I and an M and an E
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
That spells good time
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
Head for that Waffle House way across town
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
It's time for a good time
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
It's time for a good time
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
It's time for a good time
I can get you where you need to go
In the woods or right uptown
I can get you where you need to go
I can get you where you need to go
I can get you where you need to go
I can get you where you need to go
Why did she have to go
So young I just don't know why
Things happen half the time
Without reason without rhyme
Lovely sweet young woman
Daughter wife and mother
I just have to believe
Loved ones she left behind
And understand the why
Anger shot straight at God
Then asking for His love
Just hoping that maybe
It's hard to say goodbye
Her picture in my mind
Will always be of times I'll cherish
We never spoke a word
But every thought she had I heard from across the room
If we were standing face to face
I couldn't find the words to say give me one more move
I don't even know her name
I guess foolish pride's to blame
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
And my heart won't tell my mind to tell my mouth what it should say
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
Wise man next to me did say
Don't you let regret take place
Of the dreams you have to chase
You might fall down on your face
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
When your heart won't tell your mind to tell your mouth what it should say
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith
When your heart won't tell your mind to tell your mouth what it should say
And to give up when you know that it feels right
Or understand when you're lonely late at night
You can blame it on the whiskey
You can blame it on the money
You can blame it on fate or time or the fact that she ain't funny
To forget if you've ever seen it once
Or tear down when you build one strong as steel
You can blame it on the whiskey
You can blame it on the money
You can blame it on fate or time or the fact that she ain't funny
Hard to take another chance
When the last one didn't last
Hard to spread like cold peanut butter on a slice of fresh white bread
You can blame it on the whiskey
You can blame it on the money
You can blame it on fate or time or the fact that she ain't funny
I left my home in Georgia
Took a dream and a dollar
Went looking for that fortune and fame
Well I found it up in Nashville
With the guitars and the fiddles
I'd played my songs in Georgia
Way down there in Florida
Once or twice in New Orleans
But the sounds I was making
Didn't know that I'd be taking them to places that's so far and strange
But the people really dug it no matter where we strummed it
Now I've played in Chicago and Western Colorado
Sung in North and South Dakota
And a TV show out in LA
They got the hats and boots
And them country roots
No matter what state they claim
Yeah the facts are plain
I've seen cowgirls a plenty
Milwaukee and in Philly PA
They got the four wheel drives on that Minnesota ice
They're dancing and they're moving
To the lyrics and the music
From Maui up to Bangor Maine
Lord it may sound strange
Yeah I've played up in Chicago and Western Colorado
Sung in North and South Dakota
And a TV show out in LA
They got the hats and boots
And them country roots
No matter what state they claim
I've played that country music
On the land and the ocean
But people can't say my name
Yeah the fact remains
Oh I've played up in Chicago and Western Colorado
Sung in North and South Dakota
And a TV show out in LA
They got the hats and boots
No matter what state they claim
Oh it may sound strange
Yeah the fact remains
It's another Tequila Sunrise
Staring slowly cross the sky
And he was just a hired hand
Working on the dreams he planned to try
And ever night when the sun goes down
Just another lonely boy in town
She wasn't just another woman
And I couldn't keep from coming home
When it comes down to seeing friends
Take another shot at courage
And wonder why the right words never come
It's another Tequila Sunrise
This whole world still looks the same
Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
I know you loved him along time ago
And even now in my arms you still want him I know
When you hold me tonight don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes let it be me
Don't pretend it's him in some fantasy
Darling just once let yesterday go
And you'll find more love than you've ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes
Maybe I've been a fool holding on all this time
Lying here in your arms knowing he's in your mind
But I keep hoping someday that you'll see the light
Don't close your eyes let it be me
Don't pretend it's him in some fantasy
And you'll find more love than you've ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes let it be me
And don't pretend it's him in some fantasy
And you'll find more love than you've ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
Trying to be fair both to me and to you
Trying not to love you is hard to do
But I guess there's no use hiding
For the love that shows
So if I'm not being clear
I'll repeat these words to you
Trying not to love you is hard to do
For the love that shows
I'll repeat these words to you
Trying not to love you is hard to do
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all
Had a very shiny nose.
You would even say it glows.
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names.
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games.
Then one foggy Christmas eve
Then how the reindeer loved him
Then one foggy Christmas eve
Then how the reindeer loved him
There goes a Mormon and a Muslim too
I see a Buddhist and a Hindu
I see a Catholic and I see you
We're all god's children
We're all god's children
We're all god's children
He's into country and he's isn't quit
There's folks on the left and the far right
But that doesn't mean that we have to fight
We're all god's children
On the same planet in the same plan
A feminist woman and a he man
We're all god's children
We're all god's children
We're all god's children
We're all god's children
We're all god's children
We're all god's children
We're all god's children
We're all god's children
We're all god's children
We're all god's children
We're all black and white
We're all precious in his sight
We're all god's children
We're all god's children
We're all god's children
On account of my baby
Walked off with another man
And money from the poor
And walked on out the door
And it sure got cold after the rain fell
What makes a man feel this way
Like a river without water
Like night without day
And it sure got cold after the rain fell
That rain began to fall
With thunderbolts and lightning
The wind began to call
And it sure got cold after the rain fell
It sure got cold after the rain fell
What I'd like from Santa
For Christmas this year
There's a lot of things
But they wouldn't mean as much
As you standing by that tree
Just put a ribbon in your hair
You'll be the best gift anywhere
There's no worldly treasure
Just put a ribbon in your hair
They were mighty pretty sites
But all those pretty things
They just can't compare
Girl on Christmas day
The greatest gift I know
Will be having you to hold
Underneath the mistletoe
Just put a ribbon in your hair
You'll be the best gift anywhere
There's no worldly treasure
Just put a ribbon in your hair
Just put a ribbon in your hair
If your heart has known such pain
Until for death it's crying
Only to have the Lord refuse
Then you've been near my side
If in your heart somehow you know
Then you have walked a road of pain
If you have had each joy of life
Destroyed and cast away
Then watch a heart that once knew love
Grow sadder day by day
If your soul is wilted like a rose
That's never felt the dew
You're traveling on the street of grief
If for your wasted wicked life
Your soul cries out in shame
And you could live it all again
It'd never be the same
You've lived the life of regret
If when the storms light up the skies
It seems you can't go on
Then from a vision your darling comes
You speak but she is gone
If then the tears flood down your cheeks
There's no one else for you
Then you can't ever hide from fate
I've got the need to testify
Don't try to fill your nest out in the open West
Six bullets in the gut or just a paper cut
Too many ways to quantify
They'll cut your ankle off to cure a minor cough
It's a hundred and one in the shade of the sun
You can live like a saint but there just really ain't
No avoiding a million ways to die
Or God forbid you steal a pie
Out on the desert plains it hardly ever rains
And you can hear coyotes cry
They'll eat you up and then they'll shit you out again
With a whoosh and a whack there's a knife in your back
It's a kick in the pants but you don't have a chance
Of escaping a million ways to die
And as the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind
He kept her picture on his wall
He still loved her through it all
Kept her letters by his bed
He had underlined in red
I went to see him just today
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today
She came to see him one last time
We all wondered if she would
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
And welcome all you danged foreigners from other nations
Dear Lord be with our guests and prepare them
For the butt whopping they are about to receive
The Olympics in Georgia
God you know we're gonna screw that up
When they let those doves go at the opening ceremony
There are gonna be guys in the parking lot with shotguns
And we will not have a flame
Of all the games that the rednecks play
There's some crazy events
If you know about the redneck ways
Then it makes perfect sense
Hell the Olympic rings will be five old tires nailed together
They gonna have no idea what half this stuff is suppose to be
There probably have to cancel water polo after
The first two or three horses drown
I tell you instead of discus throwing
They'll be flinging Ford hubcaps
You can't blame them for the way they are
But you can sit back and grin
You'll want to see it again
If you could ever get into their minds
There's no telling what you might find
They just do things in a different way
All the games that the rednecks play
And you know they haven't even thought about it
But the river they're having the kayak races
On is the same river they filmed deliverance at
That thing a French man in a pair of biker pants ain't got a chance
Be prepared to watch the wildest show
Making her out in the line
You may not see them bringing home the gold
But they'll sure make mama proud
If you could ever get inside their minds
There's no telling what you might find
They just do things in a different way
All the games that the rednecks play
Pine trees grow so tall in the bright sunshine
An alligator lays on the banks of a riverbed
And if you didn't know any better you'd swear he's dead.
Now these are a few things I'm in love with
A small part of the reason I go back
Now if you think I'm happy down there you're on the right track.
I'm a grandson of the Southland
An heir to the Confederacy.
So put me down there where I wanna be
Plant my feet with Robert E. Lee.
Bury my bones under a cypress tree
And never let me roam.
I'm a grandson of the Southland
An heir to the Confederacy.
Cotton balls gleam and the cow gives cream
Pa comes in full of gin
And he's mean as a rattlesnake.
And if the well runs dry
And we cry and cuss the garden hose
Mama draws a bucket full of creek water
Hey Louisiana woman Mississippi man we get together every time we can
The Mississippi River can keep us apart
There's too much love in the Mississippi heart too much love in this Louisiana heart
When she waves from the bank don't you know I know
The Mississippi River don't look so wide
Louisiana woman Mississippi man...
Well I thought I'd been loved but I never had
Till I was wrapped In the arms of a Mississippi man
When he holds me close it feels almost like another hurricane just ripped the coast
If he can't come to me I'm gonna go to him
That Mississippi River Lord I'm gonna swim
Hey Louisiana woman Mississippi man...
Well Mississippi River Lord it's one mile wide and I gotta get me to the other side
Hey Louisiana woman Mississippi man...
There's too much love in the Mississippi heart too much love in this Louisiana heart
I remember how you looked that day
And thought we would be together
Until we were both old and gray
7 years of loving you
My perfect world fell
My perfect world fell
7 years of loving you
Here's my hat in my hand
But I ain't do much than I did
I loved since childhood
Made you real as I could
After all you said goodbye
But I ain't be quicker
Look at your self right now
And look at you later on
U ain't look like before...
Let's begin with the day I met her
How fast this good old boys world got better
Just the first few seconds after I first seen her
Like my favorite song on a new set of speakers
My best old jeans and my broken sneakers
Sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle
She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
When it comes to loving me
She's right on the money
She's no red lights when I've over slept
She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
When it comes to loving me
She's right on the money
She's the best cook that's ever melted cheese
I ain't much around the house but I aim to please
There's absolutely no reason to doubt it
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her
She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
When it comes to loving me
May joy come in the morning
May the sparrow sing of it all day
May peace float down like an autumn leaf
And gather in piles for children to play
May forgiveness be an open field
May this be the land that I trod
May my soul be ever restless
May the afternoon flow slow like the river
Wading in pools and washing my feet
May sleep be fitful and dreams delightful
May the windows be wide open
To let the breezes blow through
May that wind be the very spirit
That lifts my prayers to you
May I always love you
May I always love you
May my faith remain a mystery
Something so real that I cannot touch
May patience be as strong as silence
Let trust be a wild beast
The lion beside which I'll lie down
And He comes to me so gently
A broken king with a royal crown
May I always love you
May I always love you
May our weeping turn to fits of laughter
May His pleasure be the treasure we're after
May hope take root like a mighty oak
Bracing itself in the snow
Knowing spring will come the Promised Son
Warming the earth and letting us grow
May I always love you
May I always love you
May I always love you
May I always love you
My hand goes with your chest
A slow and even breath
I see it in your eyes
A place for you to hide
Your heart rises and it falls just like the waves
The highest point is just before it breaks
I will light a candle for you welcoming
Let my voice anchor you
I promise the sun will rise
Your heart rises and it falls just like the waves
The highest point is just before it breaks
I will light a candle for you welcoming
You're heart rises and it falls
Just before it breaks
I will light a candle
Your heart rises and it falls just like the waves
The highest point is just before it breaks
I will light a candle for you welcoming
Your heart rises and it falls just like the waves
The highest point is just before it breaks
I will light a candle for you welcoming
It was a long hard road
We nearly lost our way
We nearly lost our will
So we clung to the rocks
Oh where the cold winds blow
We climbed that mountain
Then on the wings of an angel
Well it never was easy
To look into the eyes of love
We climbed that mountain
Then on the wings of an angel
And baby love has no fear
Leap and a net will appear
We climbed that mountain
Then on the wings of an angel
There's a crack house down across the tracks
There's just no way this could be part of the greater plan
I just can't comprehend it
I just don't understand
These days the trouble starts right where the family ends
I just can't comprehend it
I just don't understand
I just can't comprehend it
I just don't understand
But only in dreams have I felt this much
But here in my heart you have a place
You're out there waiting for me
Keeping my heart from crossing over the line
Counting the days until my dreams come true
Until the moment that I can let go
One day I know I'll say I do
I can go on a date and have a good time
But you're always there in the back of my mind
I'll know it's you when you take my hand
And right by your side is where I will stand
I know how good it's gonna be
The moment that you find me
Keeping my heart from crossing over the line
Counting the days until my dreams come true
Until the moment that I can let go
One day I know I'll say I do
Until the moment that I can let go
One day I know I'll say I do
We had something I could never do without
What a brilliant stroke of luck
Heaven's angels came like sirens in the night
Madness hit me like a truck
And the skies just opened up
Ain't no ordinary love
And the fateful arrow struck
Ain't no ordinary love
Happiness has got me jumping up for joy
Sweet bliss I'm overcome
Didn't notice I've been walking on thin air
Somehow closer to the sun
And the skies just opened up
Ain't no ordinary love
And the fateful arrow struck
Ain't no ordinary love
Such a sweet beautiful thing
Inspiration everlasting
Ain't no ordinary love
Every heart has to hurt sometimes
Every lover knows who's ever been left behind
Every time you told me
It would never be mine
Every heart has to hurt sometimes
I've always been on the other side of goodbye
Why down inside I know
Every heart has to hurt sometimes
Every lover knows who's ever been left behind
Every time you told me
It would never be mine
Every heart has to hurt sometimes
Is gonna make it easy
Every heart has to hurt sometimes
Every lover knows who's ever been left behind
Every time you told me
It would never be mine
All I do is think about you
There's a powerful sense of
I could stay here in this moment
You could ask me if I love you
If I dance around the truth with you
It would only be a lie
Touching heart and soul
Baby that's the only way
I'm gonna give you honesty
That's what you deserve
A promise to believe in
You can count on every word
Faithful and forgiving
That's how I wanna be
It's gonna be so easy
Touching heart and soul
Baby that's the only way
Touching heart and soul
Baby that's the only way
Touching heart and soul
Baby that's the only way
It only takes two hours by plane
If you drive you can make it in a day
They say the miles will tear us apart
But they don't how wrong they are
Through the lonely hours
Won't change the way I feel
You don't have to worry
This emptiness is something
When you're scared and you think we could fall
When it feels like we just might lose it all
Through the lonely hours
Won't change the way I feel
You don't have to worry
This emptiness is something
When you've been missing me a little too long
Through the lonely hours
Won't change the way I feel
You don't have to worry
This emptiness is something
They're always acting like they're so hot
I don't waste my time on guys like that
But that's not enough to make it last
The way you stare gives you away
Real love can't be that way
I don't waste my time on guys like that
But that's not enough to make it last
I don't waste my time on guys like that
But that's not enough to make it last
I don't waste my time on guys like that
But that's not enough to make it last
I think we both realize
How this is feeling something like love
That you'll stay awhile
I think we both realize
How this is feeling something like love
Another lovely misadventure in the dark
All my friends who knew me when
Tell me not to wander down that road again
It's being on that road makes me free
But I know I'm falling
The water's deep under the bridge
As I pass by our old house up on the ridge
All our sins have washed away
Now all that's left are all the things we didn't say
While my mind is telling me that it won't last
But I know I'm falling
Against the odds I'll roll the dice
I guess my heart has won despite all good advice
So grab your things and come on in
And get to know your children once again
When does a fool stop being a fool
But I know I'm falling
Let's give them someone else to talk about
But I know I'm falling
Somewhere in our hearts
Somewhere deep inside
That's worth dreaming
I get a glimpse of where
We're heading down the same road
Even though we don't know where it leads
I'm in love like you are
Until he reaches out for you or me
I imagined what would be
Our vision is the same
Even though the world through
We're heading down the same road
Even though we don't know where it leads
I'm in love like you are
Till he reaches out for you or me
We're heading down the same road
Even though we don't know where it leads
I'm in love like you are
Till he reaches out for you or me
Let your heart be light
Our troubles will be out of sight
Our troubles will be miles away.
Happy golden days of yore.
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more.
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.
You have driven him away forever
I was part of everything he planned for
And I know he loved me at the start
And now he hates the sight of all I stand for
I know he loved me from the start
Through all the years his memory will haunt me
There's a letter in a shoe box
In a dresser she keeps locked
But she's never read it all the way through
It was the last one he wrote her
She was sure it was over
From all that he told her in the first line or two
He said times are hard now
Got some things left to sort out
And a man in his freedom don't easily part
That's where she stopped reading
Her soul was bleeding
So she choose her weapon and went for his heart
With paper and pen she got her last words in
I never loved you was the lie she wrote him
He couldn't believe the reply he received
What a sad tragedy for good love to end
Who needs a knife when you can take someone's life
In just a few days he
He got on the bottle and went out of his mind
To this day she don't know
In the letter that he wrote
He asked for her hand in the very last line
With paper and pen she got her last words in
I never loved you was the lie she wrote him
He couldn't believe the reply he received
What a sad tragedy for good love to end
Who needs a knife when you can take someone's life
And all the big white houses down on St Charles Avenue
She knows right where she's heading and it's too good to be true
The don't know there ain't no shortcut on the road to happiness
As she can see those city lights she should be full of hope
Suddenly she hears her daddy and the last words that he spoke
A tender hearts an easy victim for an old silver tongue
The don't know there ain't no shortcut on the road to happiness
Take all these memories from me
Take all of the rain that's falling down
Take all of these teardrops splashing on the ground
It's about a love that's got me blue
A love forsaken for somebody new
He roles through town just like you do
He's just like the river that's only passing through
Take all these memories from me
Take all of the rain that's falling down
Take all of these teardrops splashing on the ground
I've grown so tired of all those lies
I'm on my way now to find some bluer skies
Gonna find me a ticket far from this town
Far from the river that only brings me down
Gonna send these troubles on down the line
I'm gonna let them spill and flow away like wine
Take all these memories from me
Take all of the rain that's falling down
Take all of these teardrops splashing on the ground
Take all of the rain that's falling down
Long after the last train rolled out of town
I had to find out if the world was round
Looking for god knows what
Mama gave me her bible and choked back the tears
Every night I'll remember you in my prayers
While you're looking for god knows what
God knows what I was after
God knows what was on my mind
Every step I took fell faster
Everything I left behind
Turned into the greener pastures
What will I find after all this time
Coming back from god knows what
Pride tastes bitter and dreams got hard
It's tough to admit but at least that's a start
Took along way around but that old backyard
Beats the devil out of god knows what
God knows what I was after
God knows what was on my mind
Every step I took fell faster
Everything I left behind
Turned into the greener pastures
What will I find after all this time
Coming back from god knows what
God knows what was on my mind
Every step I took fell faster
Everything I left behind
Turned into the greener pastures
What will I find after all this time
Coming back from god knows what
I heard his time was short so I went to see my old friend
When I walked through the door
He points to a picture and smiles from his easy chair
You can see his heart's broken as a lonesome tear drop to the floor
A bouquet wrapped up in ribbons and bows
But he clings to the last ray of hope
And a dozen white roses
What a shame too much pride and a jealous heart kept them apart
No card and some flowers it's quite enough to make amends
For fifty years living a life of what should have been
A bouquet wrapped up in ribbons and bows
But he clings to the last ray of hope
And a dozen white roses
A bouquet wrapped up in ribbons and bows
But he clings to the last ray of hope
Were the only traces left of that worn out Oldsmobile
And the Deputies found him where his wheels left the road
That's the tale the Sheriff told to his sister and his wife
They could claim their Dear Beloved at the White Oak Funeral Home
And the Deputy could show them where the wheels left the road
Now they're bring food and flowers to the kitchen of his home
They placed a little cross where his wheels left the road
He was not out on that highway when his wheels left the road
It was back in that old bar room in the smoke and neon lights
He was dancing with a woman just before he crossed the line
He took her in his arms and his wheels left the road
Were the only traces left of his worn out Oldsmobile
When I got the word that our Uncle Joe died
Back home to Kentucky where the funeral was held
I cried all the way to Kentucky
His memory so sweet to recall
Uncle Joe lived such a good life
Love and respected by all
His jokes were the talk of the county
He knew how to make people laugh
I cried all the way to Kentucky
And then I smiled all the way back
The Preacher said Joe was a wonderful guy
And God has a project for him in the sky
His stories are binging the Angels a smile
To turn us into new ways to cheer us awhile
Joe once brought a skunk into Sunday School class
Had even made grouchy old Deacon Jones laugh
He says it's been fixed and smells like a rose
I cried all the way to Kentucky
His memory so sweet to recall
Uncle Joe lived such a good life
Love and respected by all
His jokes were the talk of the county
He knew how to make people laugh
I cried all the way to Kentucky
And then I smiled all the way back
I think of those things when I tell Joe goodbye
A smile on my lips and a tear in my eye
I cried all the way to Kentucky
His memory so sweet to recall
Uncle Joe lived such a good life
Love and respected by all
His jokes were the talk of the county
He knew how to make people laugh
I cried all the way to Kentucky
And then I smiled all the way back
I cried all the way to Kentucky
Southern lights and how planes fly
Some things I'll never understand
Like me here again tonight
At your memories command
Next thing I'm fighting for this heart of mine
I just can't forget the night I lost you
It's still a mystery after all this time
Put it on a shelf and let it be
That promise made was all it took
For you to make a lier out of me
Next thing I'm fighting for this heart of mine
I just can't forget the night I lost you
It's still a mystery after all this time
Next thing I'm fighting for this heart of mine
I just can't forget the night I lost you
It's still a mystery after all this time
Your love would last forevermore
And it took me by surprise
When you up and walked out the door
Been suffering through this dry spell
With no relief in sight
And raising cane all night
The only way I'll make it through this drought
Is by breaking new ground
When you left me was no choice
Gonna plant my love in another field
With no rocks beneath the soil
It's high time I was leaving this old town
Start breaking new ground
The grass is getting greener slowly as the days go by
Somewhere I'll find someone to help me tear down these old walls
I won't let your memory get me down
I'm breaking new ground
When you left me was no choice
Gonna plant my love in another field
With no rocks beneath the soil
The only way a new life can be found
Is by breaking new ground
When you left me was no choice
Gonna plant my love in another field
With no rocks beneath the soil
So your bags are all packed and you're leaving
Without so much as telling me why
Pardon me if I skip all the grieving
I'll simply get on with my life
It'll come back on you and you'll pay
But won't be me you'll answer to
And your penance is due
For the things that you've done
To be feeling the way that I am
I should get on my knees
And start praying for your absolution
But I've tried and I can't
After what you did to me and to us
You've betrayed all my love and my trust
It won't be me you'll answer to
And your penance is due
For the things that you've done
Now this isn't a threat or a curse
Just remember you heard it here first
It won't be me you'll answer to
And your penance is due
For the things that you've done
A letter from home came this morning
And each line on that handwritten page
Drew a picture of life in Louisiana
And just how long that I've been away
So I thought I would drop you a line
Just to tell you how we long to see you
And to say that we're doing just fine
I don't know all the people who've told me
That they've stayed up way past their bedtime
On the TV last Saturday night
Your Dad heard your song in New Orleans
And he told me that he felt so proud
That he pulled alongside of the highway
And he turned up that radio loud
Are those city folks treating you well
If you need anything you can call us
We love you more than just words could ever tell
I remember when you were just a baby
The best years that we've ever had
Until they're gone we'll forever remember
My first mistake was thinking I knew where I stood
I thought I had a place here in your heart
But a girl can only chase a dream so far
Do you see forever when you look at me
Am I the everything you'll ever need
Does this feeling have a chance at all
If you can't tell me where I stand
I'll find somewhere else to fall
I'm still waiting for a reason not to leave
Tell me before I take another stand
Do you see forever when you look at me
Am I the everything you'll ever need
Does this feeling have a chance at all
If you can't tell me where I stand
I'll find somewhere else to fall
Do you see forever when you look at me
Am I the everything you'll ever need
Does this feeling have a chance at all
If you can't tell me where I stand
I'll find somewhere else to fall
Meet me in heaven someday
Will you meet me in heaven someday
Join me in that beautiful place
And meet me in heaven someday
Till the angel of death stares you right in the face
To meet me in heaven someday
Will you meet me in heaven someday
Join me in that beautiful place
And meet me in heaven someday
Will you meet me in heaven someday
Join me in that beautiful place
A few months down a country road they're walking down the aisle.
The only use she's got for sushi's baiting up a hook.
And the snow was coming harder all the time.
Somehow someone's eyes were watching me.
Since not too many ventured up this way.
But she only sat and watched the flames grow higher.
And I've come back so Jimmy can go free.
She only said tomorrow I must go.
Then I shrugged and said I'll never know I guess.
Was Mary Ellen in a wedding gown.
Was to have one death row prisoner set free.
But I shivered when I read his first was James.
Named Mary Ellen on his father's side.
On a hill of weeds where a piece of wood stuck out.
I've been on the road
I've been to the south
Where the winds they were warm
And I've seen what was war
The ruins and the scars
The wounds and the blood
Seen the dying of all
Seen the world in the shadow
Is it's mushrooming cloud
The lies and the greed
Of the leaders of men
Those cheats who would take us
For it's love that I see
The courage and strength
Of the young men's smile
I've been to the south
Where the winds they were warm
Darkness it is fading
The day it is dawning
The fields they are empty
Farmers and young men
Yet one day we'll see them
Will return to their homes
Yet still my heart grieves
The price of the young brides
The widows and sweethearts
The call when it came
Found our menfolk aye ready
Each knew the reasons
For war so they'd thought
Then came the doubting
But still they were steady
Slow dying in cold clay
Yet one day we'll see them
There on the hillside
Not knowing in hearts
They are but to dream
The grief in the long glen
The gloom at the fireside
Will pass like the spring breeze
I lived the free live of the rover
From the Murray's green basin to the dusty outback
I waltzed my Matilda all over
It's time to stop rambling
There's work to be done
And they sent me away to the war
As our ship pulled away from the quay
And amidst all the cheers
How well I remember that terrible day
Our blood stained the sand and the water
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter
He nearly blew us right back to Australia
The Turks buried theirs
Then we started all over again
While around me the corpses piled higher
When I woke up in my hospital bed
I saw what it had done and I wished I was dead
I never knew there were worse things than dying
For I'll go no more waltzing Matilda
All around the green bush far and near
To hump tent and pegs
A man needs both legs
No more waltzing Matilda for me
And shipped us back home to Australia
And as our ship pulled into Circular Quay
I looked at the place where my legs used to be
And thanked Christ there was no one there waiting for me
As they carried us down the gangway
They just stood there and stared
Then they turned all their faces away
So now every April I sit on my porch
See the parades pass before me
Reliving their dreams of past glory
The tired old heroes of a forgotten war
And I ask myself the same question
And the old men still answer the call
Their number get fewer
Someday no one will march there at all
Now their ghosts can be heard
It ruffled up my feathers
And it barked right up my tree
When Suddenly it seemed
All the fingers were pointing on up at me
And the footsteps in the sand
And we are were all getting
To leave me in stitches
Bursting at the seams
Bursting at the seams
When the sun came out to greet me
I only saw the wolves from my dreams
This is my Berlin blues song
Sometimes life can get a little wrong
Where we one day would delve
Where there is no more walking on eggshells
Where ideas are for free
And I'll see you there
With your hands in the air
Where the canvas is bare
And there's no more despair
And your third eye will stare
And I'll see you there
This is my Berlin blues song
Sometimes life can get a little wrong
Where we one day would delve
Where there is no more walking on eggshells
Where ideas are for free
And I'll see you there
With your hands in the air
Where the canvas is bare
And there's no more despair
And your third eye will stare
And I'll see you there
This is my Berlin blues song
Sometimes life can get a little wrong
And unclench your fists
I can't see you through the mist
From inside your head
Your eyes are looking dead
Take back those words
I'm not as strong as I look
It's my soul that you shook
And my heart that you took
Leave me in my misery
Hopefully I'll forget you someday
I have to stop my soul's decay
You've taken all my dignity
It's clear to me that this ain't child's play
Would you take me under your wing
Would you take me under your wing
And I've been running away from the wise man in my head
And I've been hearing some whispers on the wind
But don't leave that fiery mind behind
Take it along for the ride
And don't leave that fiery mind behind
And there'll be an airplane flying across my soul
And it will role right on
I'll have to say fair well so long
And there'll be a steam train rolling across my heart
I will have to depart
But don't leave that fiery heart now
But don't leave that fiery heart behind
Take it along for the ride
Don't leave that fiery mind behind
Take it along for the ride
And I've been running away from the wise man in my head
He's been throwing caution to the wind
Filling an hourglass with his sins
He only cares for momentary winds
And he's walked the plane to the bitter end
And there's always gone after the storm
Where angels fear to tread
But his hands are gold
And his heart is worn
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
A drowning man will clutch at a straw
Will die by the sword
And all is fair in love and war
He's been throwing caution to the wind
Filling an hourglass with his sins
He only cares for momentary winds
His highest worship has shaken his names
But he's run with wolves to be standing here
And he's walked on edges to have no fear
And he's climbed the walls to see this view
And he's fought many wars and lost very few
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
A drowning man will clutch at a straw
Will die by the sword
And all is fair in love and war
You with your head in the clouds
You've been running around
On the tight ropes you found
In the minds of the weak you seek to speak
With fire on your tongue
You with your eyes on the prize
Don't you wear the disguise
That the truths of your lies unfold
To the victims of your steady rise
You're prize at the expense of the weak
You're on the peak and you dancing chick to chick
With the devil's sweetheart
That brings me to my knees
Won't you take me on home
I'm drunk and I'm stoned
I got no place else to go
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
Won't you take me on home
I'm drunk and I'm stoned
I got no place else to go
I don't wanna be alone
I sure can't describe
The look in your eyes
There's no describing this
There's no denying this
From the tips of your toes
To the end of your nose
Won't you take me on home
I'm drunk and I'm stoned
I got no place else to go
And I know I don't wanna be alone
There once was an island
Further than any boat had reached
And she sat there in silence
Her body could never leave
But her mind would travel multitudes
You and I could not conceive
When the night sky's your only friend
When you're tired of playing pretend
When the ground under your feet
Feels like no more than a dream
And you're in over your head
And your instincts are not fed
There's no time to be
On that island with me
Far away from the city
From the litter and poverty
And he's staring manically
The ground I've tread so many years
All this blood and sweat and tears
And do just what I'm told
If only I had been so bold
But now my body's getting old
If only it could be frozen
But you took it away from me
You took it away from me
You took it away from me
When you brainwashed me
With formulas of how I should be
Told me what I could and could not see
Life's flown overhead
There's a bird trapped in his head
But he ignores it instead
And his spirit has long fled
And now he is hard to the core
She's not around anymore
Life's flown overhead
If you just stop asking why
If you just stop asking why
If you just stop asking why
And stare with you ahead
And give you all my red
And put it in your head
But I will still dream of one day
Might not be so far away
I'll blame it on fear
I pushed and I pushed
And I shoved and I shoved
Sometimes I can't breathe
And I push you out to sea
That this ain't the end
And you opened my heart again
But we've got mountains to climb
Sure I'm happy when you're mine
Awake from your slumber
You've been sleeping far too long
Your eyes have been shut tight
I'd like to pry them wide
I found your naked body
An empty shell down in a well
I'm sure it felt like hell
You had blood on your hands
And like the wind from the east
And like the wind from the east
Then you rose from the day
Gave your eyes to the sun
Music came back to your ears
And you rose from the day
Gave your eyes to the sun
Then you looked at me
We got footsteps moving slow
We got less power and more control
We got a man up there
Who's so big and bold
And the first signs of morning
And my blue suede shoes were collecting dew
And the stained glass windows
Were shining down on me
And the whispering voices were echoing inside
And the candles they were burning just For you
As far as my feet can go
I've fallen on the muddy road
Can't always be chosen by you or me
We got footsteps moving slow
We got less power and more control
We got a man up there
Who's so big and bold
We got footsteps moving slow
We got less power and more control
We got a man up there
Who's so big and bold
We got footsteps moving slow
We got less power and more control
We got a man up there
Who's so big and bold
Singing songs of the wise and the free
And the bike slipped from beneath my drunken weight
And my body it became the tar's evening bait
But none of this is fate
And I've crawled through the bushes and the spiders and thorns
To delve beyond the barrier of the celebration core
I'm just an innocent outlaw
But I know that it's good that I'm doing this for
And my limbs have danced for the Amsterdam sunrise
With not one restriction and not one disguise
Monotony is what I despise
Integration to society would be my demise
One foot on the pavement
And one foot in the milky way
My branches scrape the sea of stars
My roots dig deep into this world of ours
My reality is what I perceive
What I attract into my orbit
Worries fade into the haze
Learn to live a little higher
Forget there ever were chains
Days move on and times they change
In a blink of an eye things rearrange
We're sucked in and we're spat out
On the other side of the rabbit hole
Forget there ever were chains
At first they shone from the pavement in gold red and brown
Now they've been trampled on and ridden over
And I think it's time to leave this town
The trees whisper secrets of summer's love affairs
Of the carelessness tomfoolery that happened everywhere
But as the doors close
I know it's time to leave this town
When the sun starts to seep through the leaves
When I can sing you a song
On these magic Berlin streets
With our night riding
You know I'll be back to live this town
I saw the price we pay
As these social schemes start to pray
Realizing there's taxes to pay
But will my fiery heart stay or I break
Will my fiery heart stay or I break
Sure I've enjoyed the ride
Sure I've enjoyed the ride
Euphoric smile for a while
Euphoric smile for a while
Euphoric smile for a while
Will my fiery heart stay or I break
Will my fiery heart stay or I break
I saw you throw your hands in the air and say a prayer
There was nothing you could do to make me love you anymore
I don't feel like I'm going anywhere with you
I might as well fling myself into your ocean
So you jumped down from the cliff you climbed to
Into paradise that lay below you
And let my tears fall into the ocean
She cut a hole in the fence and she ran
She left her troublesome prison behind
She didn't wanna fuel the fire
She didn't wanna lose her desire
She looked out to the horizon
She didn't have much left to see
Greed had taken the trees away
Greed had taken the bees away
She don't know where she's gonna go now
She looked up to where there should have been stars
Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
Fly on my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side
Silver wings silhouetted against a child's sunrise
Today is the day for you to rise
Then she took me high over yonder
Fly on my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
I wonder why he's not with me tonight
If the rain be on tonight then I won't sleep
I'm haunted by this loneliness I keep
You won't get more than you're living for
And it's too late to cry tonight
It doesn't seem much point in us carrying on
We pretend to cry but the feelings are gone
I hear the death man has lost his mate
The silence that follows him tells me about our fate
You won't get more than you're living for
And it's too late to cry tonight
Empty glass before me tells the story in my eyes
The dimness it has giving me won't let me realize
That love is more or less the state of mind we go through
With no guarantee to what it holds me or you
You won't get more than you're living for
The only time I let my heart turn to you
Now I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true
I'll take my heart and head right for the door
I've walked it now too many times with freedom for the price
Too many times to fight back tears behind my smiles
Now I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true
I'll take my heart and head right for the door
I know I must seem quite unkind to wander off tonight
And leave the moon up above to hold your gaze
It's only that my foolish heart is bound with foolish pride
Maybe some day I'll see the sunshine upon your face
Now I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true
I'll take my heart and head right for the door
I don't drink as much as I used to
Lately it just ain't my style
And hard times don't last like they used to
They pass quicker like when I was a child
Somehow I've learned how to listen
To a sound like the sun going down
And the magic the morning is bringing home
A song for a life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground
The midsummer days sit so heavy
But don't they blow like a breeze through your mind
When nothing appears in a hurry
To make up for someone's lost time
Somehow I've learned how to listen
To a sound like the sun going down
And the magic the morning is bringing home
A song for a life I have found
If I give my heart to you tonight
Will you still be by my side
Or will you be gone with the morning sun
Like a restless bird in flight
Let the love you seek
Wash away your sorrow
Let the morning be ours to keep
And if I should tell you of the love that I feel
Will you still be there for me
Or will I awake to a faded love
Searching for freedom's gain
Let the love you seek
Wash away your sorrow
Let the morning be ours to keep
Let the love you seek
Wash away your sorrow
Let the morning be ours to keep
If I give my heart to you tonight
Will you still be by my side
Or will you be gone with the morning sun
In your eyes I see gentle rain
Springtime comes in love again
Puts me back on my feet again
And in your eyes I feel no pain
And in my mind I saw love walk past
A lover's dream within my grasp
I never knew I could fall so fast
But in your eyes I found love at last
I found your love waiting at my door
I found a dream come true
I've never known a love like this before
And if you take me there I'll be waiting for you
I found your love waiting at my door
I found a dream come true
I've never known a love like this before
And if you take me there I'll be waiting for you
In your eyes I see gentle light
It gives me love when I hold you tight
And in your eyes I found love tonight
When I step on board that big jet plane
I'll be leaving our love behind
I hope its wings will carry me somewhere
I can mend this heart of mine
I'm bound to a place I can't recall
I feel the big jet slice through midnight skies
I'll search for the answers alone
And wait for the time to go home
Hear the mighty engines moan
I'll be far from here when the sun comes up
I feel the wheels touch down
As I awake from a dream I left with you
I hope a better day will find us soon
The love that we thought to be true
I'm bound to a place I can't recall
I feel the big jet slice through midnight skies
I'll search for the answers alone
I've lived a life full of sorrow
With nowhere to run or to hide
Happiness you'll see is borrowed
All I want is you by my side
To the time of happier days
All I need is love and company
All I need is you here with me
To the time of happier days
All I need is love and company
There's a chill on this evening
The night's right for grieving
Darkness surrounds him as he wanders alone
He walked past the dim lights
The pathways and street lights
They remind him of nights long ago
When his love was strong and his muscles taut
His whiskey throat was barely marred
Seeking misfortune in the lies that he told
Then a broken heart bought him to his knees
In the hour of his greatest need
Lost and forsaken by the love he could not hold
On the borderline of love again
It's bound to make you pay
On the borderline we'll make our stand
Then watch it fall away
And he stands in quiet solitude
The nights reflects upon his mood
Seeking the vision that had once been so clear
When he felt the touch of his woman's love
His pounding heart was warm and young
Now locked inside him with his anger and fear
As he moves on slowly past the trees
Down the path way home through fallen leaves
He can't believe how he'd sunken so low
So he learned to live with his injured pride
His purple heart hidden deep inside
The only reward for a love he could not show
On the borderline of love again
It's bound to make you pay
On the borderline we'll make our stand
Then watch it fall away
On the borderline of love again
It's bound to make you pay
On the borderline we'll make our stand
Could your heart ever be mine
Your arms hold me so close to you
All through the night
Your eyes gaze into mine
Saying I should believe you
Told me you loved me but then changed your mind
I never told no one how I hurt down inside until now
Could your heart ever be mine
My arms hold you so close to me
All through the night
My heart warned me this time
But I need to believe you
So I do just for tonight
But you taught me a lesson the hard way one time
Promised you loved me but then changed your mind
I never told no one how I hurt down inside until now
No matter what I say or do
I just can't seem to get inside your heart
What have I done wrong
Lately you're so far away
You just don't seem to hold me like you used to
I've got that old feeling you're leaving
I'm so tired of goodbye
I can't wait on your love forever
While you change your mind
Morning finds us face to face
I feel you staring through me while I'm talking
Familiar looks I recognize the same old looks
That said goodbye the last time
Something I'm used to
I've got that old feeling you're leaving
I'm so tired of goodbye
I can't wait on your love forever
I don't need a perfect lover to hold me in the rain
Someone to ease my pain when I feel blue
Won't you stay with me and be my only cure
Dark skies may cloud my day
But that don't bother me
As long as I can hold you close to me
With empty arms to hold when I need you
Give you all my love and more if you want me to
Dark skies may cloud my day
But that don't bother me
Walking out on me must be the way
You show me how it feels to be her
I realize the fault is mine
I'm getting everything that I deserve
Sunshiny days seem to be so blue
Each passing day I wish I still had you
My troubles would be all over now
If I could only get you off my mind
And I would give a fortune now
If I could only hold you one more time
Sunshiny days seem to be so blue
Each passing day I wish I still had you
Sunshiny days seem to be so blue
Each passing day I wish I still had you
Sunshiny days seem to be so blue
Each passing day I wish I still had you
It's been so long since I've seen him smile
I'll be counting all the miles till I get home
How many hours till I hold him
How many days before we hit the road again
Heading down this road bound for Tennessee
Lonesome feeling deep inside my heart
Longing for this weary night to end
Come the morning light I'll be back home again
How many hours till I hold him
How many days before we hit the road again
Heading down this road bound for Tennessee
How many hours till I hold him
How many days before we hit the road again
It seems the sun will never shine
The skies are so gray
And the heart you left broken is lonely
The winter wind blows through the trees
And with the song I sing
I long for the days you loved me only
Shadows only fill the empty room
Nights of lonely cries unheard
In the winter of a broken heart
The nights will never be the same
As when the love was new
Young hearts so tender in their yearning
But seasons change and lovers too
And winter's twice as cold
But the fire in one heart is always burning
Shadows only fill the empty room
Nights of lonely cries unheard
In the winter of a broken heart
Though a million hours pass the time
And lonely is the pain
And what was love is just a spell that's broken
So blow the wind and freeze the rain
And try like lovers do
Seems our hearts have never really spoken
Shadows only fill the empty room
Nights of lonely cries unheard
The nights are so lonely and the days pass me by
So we'll just move along and stop wasting time
It's over and you're doing fine
It's over and over and over
Gone are the love songs that only we knew
Robbed by the cold wind that sings the night through
Gone is the sweet love tried but untrue
It's over and my desperate heart
Is still trying to find some way hoping you'll stay
You may walk away in anger
Wear your heart upon your sleeve
You make act like it don't matter
Keep me laughing while you leave.
But burning bridges won't get me back
If you change your mind some day
Why can't we turn this scene around
Before you walk away.
Will you be leaving leaving me today
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on
The sand crumbling in our hand
I can't live this scene again.
You may turn away in silence
While the tears run down your face
Say there's nothing left to bind us
Leaving love without a trace.
But if I loved you well you'd soon find out
Why your new love falls some day
Why can't we burn this heartache down
Before you walk away.
Will you be leaving me today
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on
The sand crumbling in our hand
I can't live this scene again.
Will you be leaving me today
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on
The sand crumbling in our hand
Winding through trees like a ribbon in the wind
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track
It's not the first time I found myself alone at dawn
If I really had you once then I'd have you when I'm gone
Winding through trees like a ribbon in the wind
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track
Sun is shinning through the open boxcar door
Lying in my mind with the things I've known before
I've lost count of the hours days and times
Just the rhythm of the rails keeps the motion in my mind.
Winding through trees like a ribbon in the wind
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track
It's like I always figured
You'd be gone from me so soon
A heartache would be the outcome
And I'd be singing this lonely tune
Your friends all tell me you're happy now
And how good she's treating you
It looks to be the perfect love
Tonight I'll be lonely too
You're only trying to show me
I know you've been so unhappy
So you'll go on pretending like always
Tonight I'll be lonely too
You're only trying to show me
I know you've been so unhappy
So you'll go on pretending like always
Just give me one good reason to stay tonight
Must be something you could say to me
To keep me warm on this cold dark night
Can you bring out the best in me
That old moon is shining brightly
Up above the midnight plains
I only want your love to guide me back through the night
And take us home again
Can I bring out the best in you as well
Must be some way you could let me know
While we wait out the sun only time will tell
Will you love me or let me go
That old moon is shining brightly
Up above the midnight plains
I only want your love to guide me back through the night
And take us home again
Can you tell me what is on your mind
Chase the sorrow from your eyes
That old moon is shining brightly
Up above the midnight plains
I only want your love to guide me back through the night
You've made up your mind we don't want the same thing
And that we won't change things
And there's no use staying together
Nothing lasts forever that's what you say.
And that makes one of us not in love
And that makes one of us who can't give up
If you can walk away from the life we've made
Then that makes one of us.
I still believe we've got something worth saving
I keep hoping and praying for another chance
You've held my heart and your gonna break it
That makes one of us not in love
And that makes one of us who can't give up
If you can walk away from the life we've made
Then that makes one of us.
Lost in the silence surrounded by daydreams
Holding that someone that's holding my heart
Gives a close feeling though we're far apart.
The longest highway runs between us
Though you're just a heartbeat away
When I think of you my heart knows no distance
I've got you with me every day.
If I could be anywhere I'd truly be with you
Then once feel the embrace of your hand in mine
The longest highway can sure seem forever
Through every daydream I feel closer each time.
The longest highway runs between us
Though you're just a heartbeat away
When I think of you my heart knows no distance
All of God's children got shoes
And when we get to Heaven
Gonna put on our shoes
All over God's Heaven
All of God's children got a robe
And when we get to Heaven
Gonna put on our robes
All over God's Heaven
All over God's Heaven
I am thinking today of that beautiful land
When through wonderful grace by my Savior I stand
Will there be any stars in my crown
Will there be any stars in my crown
In the strength of the Lord let me labor and pray
Let me watch as a winner of souls
That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day
When his praise like the sea billow rolls
Will there be any stars in my crown
Living gems at His feet to lay down
It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold
Should there be any stars in my crown
Once I stood in the night with my head bowed low
In the darkness as black as the sea
And my heart was afraid and I cried
From here to the great unknown
Where no one stands alone
Like a king I may live in a palace so tall
With great riches to call my own
But I don't know a thing in this whole wide world
That's worse than being alone
From here to the great unknown
When this world is caught on fire
I wanna be caught in your will
And when this world is caught on fire
I wanna be caught in your will
You know I always will
You know I always will
When they crucified my Lord up on Calvary's hill
You know I always will
And when this world is caught on fire
I wanna be caught in your will
I'll always keep singing
You know I always will
I'll always keep singing
You know I always will
And when they crucified my Lord up on Calvary's hill
The things that I love and hold dear to my heart
Jesus only let me use them to brighten my life
Roll back the curtain of memory now and then
Show me where you brought me from and where I could have been
Just remember I'm a human and humans forget
Nothing good have I done to deserve God's own son
I'm not worthy of the scars in his hands
Yet he chose the road to Calvary to die in my stead
Why he loved me I can't understand
Roll back the curtain of memory now and then
Show me where you brought me from and where I could have been
Just remember I'm a human and humans forget
Just remember I'm a human and humans forget
I don't know about tomorrow
I just live from day to day
I don't borrow from the sunshine
And I don't worry for the future
For I know what Jesus said
And today I'll walk beside him
For he's what lies ahead
Many things about tomorrow
I don't seem to understand
But I know who holds tomorrow
And I know who holds my hand
Every step is getting brighter
As the golden stairs I climb
Every burden's getting lighter
There the sun is always shining
There no tear will ever dim the eye
At the ending of the rainbow
Where the mountains touch the sky
Many things about tomorrow
I don't seem to understand
But I know who holds tomorrow
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die
Once upon a time there lived a man and his name was Isaac
He walked with God both day and night but he didn't wanna die
God smiled down on Isaac and gave him fifteen years to go
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die
Lord I wanna go to heaven but I don't wanna die
I long for the day when I'll have new birth
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die
When Jesus lived here on this Earth he knew his father's plan
He knew that he must give his life to save the soul of men
When Judas had betrayed him her father heard him cry
He was brave until his death but he didn't wanna die
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die
Lord I wanna go to heaven but I don't wanna die
I long for the day when I'll have new birth
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die
I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold
I'd rather be his than have riches untold
I'd rather have Jesus than houses or land
Than to be a king of the best domain
Or be held in sin's dreads way
I'd rather have Jesus than anything
This world affords today
I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause
I'd rather be faithful to his dear cause
I'd rather have Jesus then worldwide things
I'd rather be true to his holy name
Than to be a king of the best domain
Or be held in sin's dreads way
I'd rather have Jesus than anything
I believe my steps are growing wearier each day
Still I've got a journey on my mind
Lures of this old world have ceased to make me wanna stay
And my one regret is leaving you behind
If it proves to be his will that I am first to go
And somehow I'll be feeling it will be
When it comes your times to travel likewise don't feel lost
For I will be the first one that you'll see
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
And when I see you coming I will rise up with the shout
And come running through the shallow waters reaching for your hand
Through this life we've labored hard to earn our meager fare
It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes
I'll just rest here on this shore and turn my eyes away
Until you come then we'll see paradise
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
And when I see you coming I will rise up with the shout
And come running through the shallow waters reaching for your hand
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
And when I see you coming I will rise up with the shout
If I could have the world and all it owns
If all the earth were mine to hold
With wealth my only goal
I'd spend my gold on selfish things
Without the love that Your life brings
Just a little bit more is all I'd need
Till life was torn from me
I'd rather be in the palm of Your hand
Though rich or poor I may be
Faith can see right through the circumstance
Sees the forest in spite of the trees
Your grace provides for me
No faith in promises You keep
I'd have no way to buy my bread
With a bottle for my bed
But if I trust the One who died for me
Who shed His blood to set me free
If I live my life to trust in You
Your grace will see me through
I'd rather be in the palm of Your hand
Though rich or poor I may be
Faith can see right through the circumstance
Sees the forest in spite of the trees
If I could have the world
When I was a little boy
And the devil would call my name
Who do you think you're fooling
I'm a singer in a Sunday choir
Gets down on her knees and hugs me
And she loves me like a rock
She rocks me like the rock of ages and loves me
When I was grown to be a man
And the devil would call my name
Who do you think you're fooling
I'm a consummated man
I can snatch a little purity
Gets down on her knees and hugs me
And she loves me like a rock
She rocks me like the rock of ages and loves me
And if I was president
The minute Congress called my name
Who do you think that you're fooling
I'm up on the presidential podium
Gets down on her knees and hugs me
And she loves me like a rock
She rocks me like the rock of ages and loves me
I built my world around you
You don't need me now
I built my world around you
I knew in this heart of mine
That you were someone I couldn't forget
Spent my life looking for that somebody
To make me feel like you
Now you tell me that you want to leave me
I knew in this heart of mine
That you were someone I couldn't forget
Spent my life looking for that somebody
To make me feel like you
Now you tell me that you want to leave me
I built my world around you
You don't need me now
I built my world around you
I'm just an old hound dog
Roaming around door to door
I've got all this and heaven above
I'm coming back to you one fine day
On my way back to Georgia
On my way back to Georgia
I get a feeling in me
When I remember all those crazy days and crazier nights
Can't you hear the music playing
You must have heard them saying
I'm coming back to you one fine day
On my way back to Georgia
On my way back to Georgia
I'm just an old hound dog
I've got all this and heaven above
I'm coming back to you one fine day
I'm coming back to you one fine day
On my way back to Georgia
I stood on faith and the corner of ambition
I came here to sink or swim
And to show them all that they were wrong
And though I never thought I'd make it this far
So the curtains are down
For the moment I'm someone
But there's always someone at home who never forgets who you are
I won't be bound to a life out in the cold
It's been a steady pace to keep my steps between these cracks on Broadway
I won't be bound to a life out in the cold
It's been a steady pace to keep my steps between these cracks on Broadway
It's been a steady pace to keep my steps between these cracks on Broadway
It's like I always figured
You'd be gone from me so soon
A heartache would be the outcome
And I'd be singing this lonely tune
Your friends all tell me you're happy now
And how good she's treating you
It looks to be the perfect love
Tonight I'll be lonely too
You're only trying to show me
I know you've been so unhappy
So you'll go on pretending like always
Tonight I'll be lonely too
You're only trying to show me
I know you've been so unhappy
So you'll go on pretending like always
Could your heart ever be mine
Your arms hold me so close to you
All through the night
Your eyes gaze into mine
Saying I should believe you
Told me you loved me but then changed your mind
I never told no one how I hurt down inside until now
Could your heart ever be mine
My arms hold you so close to me
All through the night
My heart warned me this time
But I need to believe you
So I do just for tonight
But you taught me a lesson the hard way one time
Promised you loved me but then changed your mind
I never told no one how I hurt down inside until now
When God dips His love in my heart
When God dips His pen of love in my Heart
And He writes my soul a message He wants me to know
His spirit all divine fills a sinful soul of mine
When God dips His love in my heart
I said I wouldn't tell it to a living soul
How He brought salvation and He made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart
He made me laugh and He made me cry
Set my sinful soul on fire
When God dips His love in my heart
And some unburdened sorrow keeps me from the goal
To whisper sweet peace to my soul
I said I wouldn't tell it to a living soul
How He brought salvation and He made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart
He made me laugh and He made me cry
Set my sinful soul on fire
When God dips His love in my heart
He walked up every step of Calvary's rugged way
And He gave His life completely to bring a better day
My life was steeped in sin but in love He took me in
His blood washed away every stain
I said I wouldn't tell it to a living soul
How He brought salvation and He made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart
He made me laugh and He made me cry
Set my sinful soul on fire
When God dips His love in my heart
When God dips His love
Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to I will
And if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same
Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
And the things you do endear you to me
Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
And the things you do endear you to me
I went to bed so sad and blue
Then I had a dream of you
I dreamed I was strolling in the evening
Underneath the harvest moon
I was thinking about you
Then we met out in the moonlight
The stars were shining in your eyes
But another was there too
I don't believe you've met my baby
I wondered who you were talking to
I shook the hand of your stranger
But I was shaking all inside
I was still wondering who
Your arm was resting on her shoulder
Her eyes were filled with victory
And then my heart was filled with ease
If I could have the world and all it owns
If all the earth were mine to hold
With wealth my only goal
I'd spend my gold on selfish things
Without the love that Your life brings
Just a little bit more is all I'd need
Till life was torn from me
I'd rather be in the palm of Your hand
Though rich or poor I may be
Faith can see right through the circumstance
Sees the forest in spite of the trees
Your grace provides for me
No faith in promises You keep
I'd have no way to buy my bread
With a bottle for my bed
But if I trust the One who died for me
Who shed His blood to set me free
If I live my life to trust in You
Your grace will see me through
I'd rather be in the palm of Your hand
Though rich or poor I may be
Faith can see right through the circumstance
Sees the forest in spite of the trees
If I could have the world
It's good to see you again
Come and sit for a while
I've missed your smile
Today the past is goodbye
Can't you hear it calling
You were longing to find
And I've been here all along
Have your eyes failed to find
What took you from mine
A vision that's faded through time
Far on a summer's day
But you heard it calling
You were longing to find
Don't doubt your heart
I'm right where you are
Don't doubt your heart
I'm right where you are
I'm admitting I was wrong and I'll just take what's mine
And walk right out the door
I'll split and I'll be gone and you'll have memories
You'll find hard to ignore
I'll see you sometime maybe
How you drove me crazier
How much I loved you anymore
Put me out of your head now that you're free and easy
Out there on the town
I was there to lay you down
I'll see you sometime maybe
How I drove you crazier
Forget about those starlit nights
I can't remember when it felt so right
So just forget about it
Don't try to tease me with your smile
If we chance to meet somewhere
I'll see you sometime maybe
How you drove me crazier
Forget about those starlit nights
I can't remember when it felt so right
Do you remember the last time I said
If I ever thought of lying
I'd rather think of dying instead
The last time you called me
To say we were through
How it took a million tears
Just to prove they all were for you
But it wouldn't have made any difference
How could you love me
When it wouldn't have made any difference
You just did not love me
In the most unfaithful arms
That you've always pictured me
And though I can't always show proof I was true
No one else could change my mind
Or stop me coming home to you
But it wouldn't have made any difference
How could you love me
When it wouldn't have made any difference
You just did not love me
Enough not to leave me
Enough not to look for
A reason to be unhappy with me
And make me regret ever wanting you
Wouldn't have made any difference...
Do you remember the last time I said
Yesterday the odds were stacked in favor of my expectations
Tuesday came and went and now I'm in a little situation
Maybe I can stand alone
Maybe I'm strong as stone
Even though the bird has flown
Maybe he'll fly on home
Forgive me if I'm keeping you apart from better conversation
Tell me that I'm smart enough to deal with all the information
Maybe I can stand alone
Maybe I'm strong as stone
Even though the bird has flown
Maybe he'll fly on home
Maybe I can stand alone
Maybe I'm strong as stone
Even though the bird has flown
Did you think you could lose that feeling without me knowing
Are you wishing you'd never met me
All the losing and the knowing
That you love her still
Could be nothing to what empty hearts must feel
Tell me what an empty heart must feel
Did you think you could lose that feeling without me knowing
Are you wishing you'd never met me
Did you think you could lose that feeling without me knowing
All the losing and the knowing that you love her still
Could be nothing to what empty hearts must feel
My father was a farmer
But his head was in the sky
He worked everyday but Sunday
He prayed for rain and thunder
And listened for the sound
In the dry years he went under
He never got off the ground
We all dream when we're younger
That we will do great things
To wear a pilot's wings
But the circles that I ran in
Turned my head around
And the planes I had my plans in
Never got off the ground
Don't raise your hopes
The closer they are to flying away
Don't raise your hopes
The closer they are to flying away
They say there but for fortune
Is the way it would have been
If we could take a bigger portion
We'd fill our hands again
You see them on the sidewalks
In the parks all over town
Those who've taken flight
I don't pick up the mail
I don't pick up the phone
I don't answer the door
I'd just as soon be alone
I don't keep this place up
I just keep the lights down
I don't live in these rooms
I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shadow upon these walls
As quietly as a mouse I haunt these halls
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control
You took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house
I don't care if it rains
I don't care if it's clear
I don't mind staying in
There's another ghost here
He sits down in your chair
And he shines with your light
And he lays down his head
On your pillow at night
I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shadow upon these walls
I'm living proof of the damage heartbreak does
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control
You took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house
That once burned out of control
You took my body and soul
Where were you when I was sitting back here
How high will you fly
Don't mean to leave you standing on your own
I think back on days and nights we had long ago
Maybe love is just a game you play
Where were you when I was sitting back here
Now I don't tell stories
And I won't be around to say I told you then
That'll take a while to mend
But it don't matter now
Where were you when I was sitting back here
Who would sell their soul for love
Or waste one tear on compromise
Should be easy enough
To know a heartache in disguise
But the heart rules the mind
And the going gets rough
When you find that kind of love
I can't help feeling like a fool
Since I lost that place inside
Where my heart knew its way
And my soul was ever wise
Once innocence was lost
There was not faith enough
Still my heart held on
When it found that kind of love
Though beauty is rare enough
Somehow we'll find it there
At least it should be fair
But if it's only tears and pain
Isn't it still worth the cost
Like some sweet saving grace
Or a river we must cross
If we don't understand
What this life is made of
When we find that kind of love
There is not faith enough
The rain outside is shifting in the wind
The road is looking lonelier alone again
The words you say condemn you as the guilty one
I guess you're not the kind you claim to be
Always looking out to get your love for free
Could you lie and say you love me just a little
One more wrong will keep us one more night
When quiet fades at the light of day
When morning breaks my heart won't understand
Spend a lifetime raising houses on the sand
The rain outside is shifting in the wind
The road is looking lonelier alone again
Could you lie and say you love me just a little
One more wrong will keep us one more night
When quiet fades at the light of day
I hope that I won't be that wrong anymore
I hope that I've learned this time
I hope that I find what I'm reaching for
The way that it is in my mind
Someday I'll get over you
I'll live to see it all through
Dreaming my dreams with you
I won't let it change me
I'd rather believe in love
To those that I'm fondest of
Someday I'll get over you
I'll live to see it all through
Dreaming my dreams with you
Someday I'll get over you
I'll live to see it all through
Ain't gonna marry in the fall
Ain't gonna marry in the spring
With a pretty little girl
Who wears a diamond ring
You're just a country boy
But you've got silver
Gold in the morning sun
Gold in the morning sun
Never gonna kiss the ruby red lips
Of the prettiest girl in town
Never gonna ask her if she'll marry you
She'd only turn you down
You're just a country boy
But you've got silver
Gold in the morning sun
Gold in the morning sun
Never could afford a store bought ring
All you can afford is a loving heart
You're just a country boy
But you've got silver
Gold in the morning sun
That is where he lived
That is where he died
Hear the weeping willows cry
I wish I had a simple love like that
I want a simple love like that
I hope I had a simple love like that
My momma was his only little girl
If he'd had the money he'd have given her the world
Oh how I long to hear that harmony
I want a simple love like that
Always giving never asking back
When I'm in my final hour looking back
I hope I had a simple love like that
I want a simple love like that
Always giving never asking back
When I'm in my final hour looking back
In the spring of 1856 with the snow still on the ground
Two little boys were lost in the mountains above the town
The two had gone to follow him and lost their way instead
By dusk the boys had not been found and fear had turned to dread
Two hundred men had gathered there to comb the mountainside
The fires were built on the highest peak in hopes they'd see the light
We're so cold and hungry and our feet are tired and sore
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door
He saw a path between two hills near a dark and swollen stream
He told his wife he saw the boys huddled close beside a log
For two more nights the dream returned this vision sent from God
We're so cold and hungry and our feet are tired and sore
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door
A thousand men had searched in vain the west side of Bob's Creek
But Jacob's wife knew of this place and said to travel east
With a guide to take him there Jacob came upon the scene
And found the boys cold and still beneath the old birch tree
As you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord
Know that we will meet you here at Heaven's door
As you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord
There's no need to cry
Before you understand
I'm just away down the river
A hundred miles or more
I'll be standing waiting
With all who've gone before
I'm just away down the river
A hundred miles or more
Now the pictures on the wall
Will help you to recall
All the good times we had
I'm just away down the river
A hundred miles or more
I'll be standing waiting
With all who've gone before
I'm just away down the river
A hundred miles or more
When it's time to leave
You're gonna feel the mountain breeze
And the snow will fill the stream
I'm just away down the river
A hundred miles or more
I'll be standing waiting
With all who've gone before
I'm just away down the river
Way back in the mountains
Way back in the hills
There used to live a mountaineer
He could play most anything
And some say he could sing
But the one thing that he liked to do best
So get out the fiddle
We'll make music till the rafters ring
When the neighbors had a shindig
And they all had vittles to eat
We'd always have to wait on Will
For the frolic to be complete
When he comes down from the mountain
All the gals began to sway
Until the break of day
Tell all the young folks to get inside
We'll make music till the rafters ring
Tell all the young folks to get inside
We'll make music till the rafters ring
As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the starry crown
Down in the river to pray
As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the robe and crown
Down in the river to pray
As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the starry crown
Down in the river to pray
As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the robe and crown
Down in the river to pray
As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the starry crown
Down in the river to pray
As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the robe and crown
Rest your head close to my heart
Don't you mind what they say
Let those eyes sparkle and shine
If they knew sweet little you
They'd end up loving you too
All those same people who scold you
What they'd give just for the right to hold you
From your head down to your toes
But you're so precious to me
All of those people who scold you
What they'd give just for the right to hold you
From your head down to your toes
But you're so precious to me
Come all ye young fellas
Beware of night rambling
By the setting of the sun
And beware of an accident
That happened of late
She was going to her uncle's
When a shower came on
She went under a green bush
Her white apron wrapped around her
He took her for a swan
But a hush and a sigh
He quickly ran to her
And found she was dead
And there on her bosom
He ran home to his father
With his gun in his hand
Her white apron wrapped around her
He took her for a swan
But a hush and a sigh
He roamed near the place
Where his true love was slain
But his cries were in vain
As he look on the lake
And the sun slowly sank
I've had nothing but sorrow
Since you said we were through
There's no hope for tomorrow
How's the world treating you
Every sweet thing that matters
Has been broken in two
All my dreams have been shattered
How's the world treating you
Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day you're away
Though our pathways have parted
To your memory I'm true
How's the world treating you
Do you wonder about me
Like I'm hoping you do
Are you lonesome without me
Have you found someone new
Are you burning and yearning
Do you think of returning
Or take myself far from this place
I thought I heard a black bell toll
A little bird did sing
Man has no choice when he wants everything
We'll rise above the scarlet tide
That trickles down through the mountain
And separates the widow from the bride
Man goes beyond his own decision
Gets caught up in the mechanism
Of swindlers who act like kings
And brokers who break everything
The dark of night was swiftly fading
Close to the dawn of day
We'll rise above the scarlet tide
That trickles down through the mountain
And separates the widow from the bride
We'll rise above the scarlet tide
That trickles down through the mountain
You'll walk unscathed through musket fire
No cutlass wound will mar thy face
And as you walk through death's dark veil
And those who hunt thee down will fail
Asleep inside the cannon's mouth
They'll seek to bind me North and South
The field is cut and bleeds to red
The infirmary man may count me dead
The wind is blowing down the quiet river
A shining road that carries you alone
If you're to live I must give you up to God
I know our God will guide protect and keep you
Teach you faith and hold you by the heart
Though your mother's heart is broken by your leaving
Her Father knows just who he is and who you are
I wish that life wasn't always ending up this way
With heaven's love at stake and hell to pay
But you in God's loving plan might be the missing part
So I give you to his heart
A shining road that leaves me all alone
Some day we'll stand in God's fair and forever home
I wish that life wasn't always ending up this way
With heaven's love at stake and hell to pay
But you in God's loving plan might be the missing part
So I give you to his heart
I wish that life wasn't always ending up this way
With heaven's love at stake and hell to pay
But you in God's loving plan might be the missing part
How pale is the sky that brings forth the rain
As the changing of seasons prepares me again
For the long bitter nights and the wild winter's day
My heart has grown cold my love stored away
My heart has grown cold my love stored away
Where souls have been lost and the walking wounded go
I've taken the pain no girl should endure
But faith can move mountains
Faith can move mountains of that I am sure
Just get me through December
A promise I'll remember
Get me through December
No divine purpose brings freedom from sin
And peace is a gift that must come from within
I've looked for the love that will bring me to rest
Feeding this hunger beating strong in my chest
Feeding this hunger beating strong in my chest
Get me through December
A promise I'll remember
Get me through December
Where souls have been lost and the walking wounded go
I've taken the pain no girl should endure
But faith can move mountains
Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
No matter what I might say
There's a message in the wire
And I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand
And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
No matter what my friends say
And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
No matter what my friends say
I keep lying to myself
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
No matter what my friends say
I keep lying to myself
No matter what my friends might say
Finding my way wasn't easy to do
But I knew there was you all the while
And it's been worth every mile
And kiss all the hurting of this world away
Hold me so close that I feel your heart beat
And don't ever wander away
Mornings and evenings all were the same
There was no music till I heard your name
I knew when I saw you smile
And now I can rest for a while
And kiss all the hurting of this world away
Hold me so close that I feel your heart beat
And don't ever wander away
Hold me so close that I feel your heart beat
And don't ever wander away
Don't sigh a sigh for me
Don't ever cry for me
This is goodbye for me
Love sang it's song for me
Then things went wrong for me
Nights are too long for me
Because I'm losing you
Our love and our devotion
Were deep as any ocean
Then one day like the tide you began to change
And you became a perfect stranger
Someone is holding you
Sharing the lips I knew
I can't believe it's true
I can't believe it's true
You can send me pretty flowers
You can send me valentines
Send me letters every day but it won't pay
You can hang around and love me
You can hang your head and cry
You can give me your affection
You can give me all your love
You can hang around and love me
You can hang your head and cry
You can call me your own darling
You can call me what you may
Call me on the telephone I won't be home
With your bright lights and your avenues so wild
With your bright lights and your avenues so wild
And the sky was never blue
I know you won't believe these things I tell you
Your heart has been forewarned all men will lie to you
So I've prepared these statements far from true
The sky was never blue
Sometimes at night you look like a long white train
Winding your way away somewhere
But if you're on the run
River I love you just the same
When you're out of hand and your muddy bubbles
Carrying away the things I treasure
Hell there ain't ain't no way to measure
Than I did the day before
Sometimes at night you look like a long white train
Winding your way away from me
River I've never seen the sea
But sometimes in a time of trouble
When you're out of hand and your muddy bubbles
Carrying away the things I treasure
Hell there ain't ain't no way to measure
Than I did the day before
Sometimes at night you look like a long white train
Winding your way away from me
Every time you get to feeling blue
And I'll be dreaming of you
Every time you get to feeling blue
Every time you get to feeling blue
It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried up on some line
By the rivers of my memory
And keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's crying to her mother
I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
But not to where I cannot see
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
Your beard a roughening coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across your face
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
By the rivers of my memories
No use in kissing other lips
My heart must hear to ever sing again
For your poison love has stained the life
But in my heart and soul dear
While my pleadings has all been in vain
For you and you alone dear
And you know that you are guilty of the same
For one and one alone dear
Blood in my heart and soul dear
All your poison love has stained the life
But in my heart and soul dear
For you and you alone dear
And you know that you are guilty of the same
But still my heart cries out for you
And you alone my darling
It makes me never ever let you go
But my pleadings has all been in vain
For you and you alone dear
For your poison love has stained the life
But in my heart and soul dear
While my pleadings has all been in vain
For you and you alone dear
You give your hand to me
And then you say hello
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
You think you know me well
But you don't know me
No you don't know the one
Who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips
To you I'm just a friend
That's all I've ever been
But you don't know me
Though my heart aches with love for you
You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
You watched me walk away
The one who loves you so
Though my heart aches with love for you
You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
You watched me walk away
The one who loves you so
There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees half forlorn
And there on a sunny morning
Little Jimmy Brown was born
All the chapel bells were ringing
In the little valley town
And the songs that they were singing
Was for baby Jimmy Brown
And the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
Bless this hour of meditation
Guide him with eternal love
There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Beneath the mountains high above
And there twenty years thereafter
Jimmy was to meet his love
All the chapel bells were ringing
Twas a great day in his life
For the songs that they were singing
Was for Jimmy and his wife
And the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
Bless oh Lord this celebration
May their lives be filled with love
From the village hidden deep in the valley
A soul which wait in the heaven
Jimmy Brown had passed away
Just the lonely bell was ringing
In the little valley town
Twas there will it was singing
And the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
May his soul find this salvation
I tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
I jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping
Out on the streets the traffic starts jumping
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
You're in the same boat with a lot of your friends
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
Remember Christmas only comes one time a year
You alone can bring me cheer
I can't remember when you felt so all alone
Then I saw you standing walk into the room
And you took away the sorrow
And you took away the gloom
Remember Christmas only comes one time a year
You alone can bring me cheer
You alone can bring me cheer
We could spend the night together
We could rock the night away
On holiday you need some company
Show me what you got for me
You are a shining star
You got everything that is on my list
Remember Christmas only comes one time a year
You alone can bring me cheer
Remember Christmas only comes one time a year
You alone can bring me cheer
I know you're just doing your job
I watch you fill up my stocking
But when I offer you some Christmas greetings
There'll be no other woman who'll treat you like I can
I watch you fill up my stocking
But when I offer you some Christmas greetings
You just keep on walking
I watch you fill up my stocking
But when I offer you some Christmas greetings
You just keep on walking
You just keep on walking
I watch you fill up my stocking
It would be fun to be certain that I'm the one
To know that I at least supply the shoulder you cry upon
Upon my favorite star
Moon I will touch your face
Challenge eagles to a chase
No boundaries no fears
My heart was born to dream to see the world from way up here
Where the wind is free
Down below they'll finally know that this heart was made to fly
No boundaries no fears
My heart was born to dream to see the world from way up here
My heart was born to dream to see the world from way up here
I sat in the window of my room
It was all I could do
It was all I could do
In all of this sorrow
I still see your dear little head
Those words you said to me have broken my heart
They were false and did lie
But your leaving is worse
Your leaving is worse
And leaving me all alone with this grief
How will I forget you
When I see your face wherever I go
It's as though I see you
With only dreams of you
With only dreams of you
You'll walk unscathed through musket fire
No cutlass wound will mar thy face
And as you walk through death's dark veil
And those who hunt thee down will fail
Asleep inside the cannon's mouth
They'll seek to bind me North and South
The field is cut and bleeds to red
The infirmary man may count me dead
The sun came up on Monday morn
The world was all in flame
It's all a mortal man can do
To make it right again
And swore to not give in
To never rest and do my best
To rid this world of sin
The one who spoke cried tears of hope
That we might change in time
And when I looked into her eyes
The fear I saw was mine
The time had come to travel on
My soul will mend at journey's end
This road will take me home.
You'll have to know when nature sleeps she dreams
Even when you can't see it inside everything
After the rain the sun will reappear
After the pain the joy will still be here
For it's out of the darkness that we learn to see
And out of the silence that songs come to be
And all that we dream of awaits patently
Gonna lay my burden down
Gonna lay my body in the ground
Cold clay against my skin
But I don't care at all
Can't seem to find my piece of mind
So with the earth I'll lay entwined
My feet are warm and dry
When I get to the other side
I'll put your picture way up high
But I'm not coming back to you
If I was cast off on the sea
Would you com and look for me
Or would you just let me sink
Beneath the waves so blue
What if I had learned to fly
Fly all night till day drew nigh
Touch down upon a branch and
Scan the crowd for you
When I touch my feet on the land
I'll kiss your lips and take you in
But you know I'm not here to stay
Darling can't you hear me cry
The moon is swaying back and forth
My body is trembling on my knees
Just have a little mercy on me
When I sleep the angels sing
But I cannot hear a thing
Dreaming of better days gone by
When I wake the trumpets play
And I'm standing at the gates
I know my race has just been won
When I was young my momma would say
If you can make it through the day
Everyone in this room has been associated with Whitey
Either through basketball or the mall or various odd
Jobs he does around town for free or at most a dollar
Face or ruthlessly made fun of his feet or voice or sister
Or shortness when he wasn't looking
But the next time you'd see him he'd still go out of his way to
Smile and wave at you and ask you about your mother's
Actually cares about someone other than himself
The reason I bring this up to you is because I was the worst
My life was simply going nowhere
Then a tiny little man rushed to my side
But he never quit on me
And his sister was freaky
Once when we were watching Sunday football
A fuzzy screen was all that we could see
Whitey came over with a hanger
And when the lightning struck him
But we just turned up the volume
And ignored the burning smell
We should all rot in hell
I went to high school with Whitey
As a joke I told him to meet me at the prom
So her trembling fingers dial the telephone.
He's the best friend that her husband ever knew.
He's the one she loans her body to.
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
In their secret hideaway
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
They don't want to hurt the others
And shake hands in the light of day.
That a woman needs a lover and a friend.
I believe my steps are growing wearier each day
Still I've got a journey on my mind
Lures of this old world have ceased to make me wanna stay
And my one regret is leaving you behind
If it proves to be his will that I am first to go
And somehow I'll be feeling it will be
When it comes your times to travel likewise don't feel lost
For I will be the first one that you'll see
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
And when I see you coming I will rise up with the shout
And come running through the shallow waters reaching for your hand
Through this life we've labored hard to earn our meager fare
It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes
I'll just rest here on this shore and turn my eyes away
Until you come then we'll see paradise
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
And when I see you coming I will rise up with the shout
And come running through the shallow waters reaching for your hand
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
And when I see you coming I will rise up with the shout
It all seemed so long ago
Young and happy don't you know
Down by the creek I would show
Fireflies to that girl
But that was back when he was nice
Before my warm heart turned to ice
My sister's wig once had lice
But that was long ago
The schoolyard's where we were
The first time I kissed her
He thought he got some tongue
But it was only retainer
Eleanore's bra is a trainer
And the woods we used to roam
The only time I had sex was on the phone
But that was long ago
I carved our names upon that tree
I loved him and he loved me
My darling wife was once a he
But that was long ago
He'd always whisper in my ear
My jewels got licked by six frisky deer
Now he's just a loner and a lier
Strangers walk through the door
I wanted much more for you
And the word of the angel was true
Underfoot and in my way
He is ours for awhile
Every tear and every smile
You say the time has come for you to go.
Why you've decided this I'll never know.
You say you've lost the love you felt for me.
Well baby you won't find it if you leave.
Pardon me if I don't understand
How a love like ours can turn out bad.
You tell me I'll be fine alone
Without the love I'm leaning on.
Well pardon me if I don't understand.
I can't see how you'll be happy far away.
But what's best for you is not for me to say.
So I'll try to keep my feelings to myself.
But forgive me if I don't do too well.
You tell me I'll be fine alone
Without the love I'm leaning on.
I've been walking these mean streets
Hard concrete beneath my feet
Ain't found a friendly face among the crowd
The city's like a Christmas tree
A light for every dreamer's dream
But it seems mine has finally burned out.
Long black train take me home
I've worn out my welcome here it's time to go
I have to face the music this just ain't where I belong
Long black train take me home.
When I thought that I'd be making
A name for myself in Babylon
Though I've tried to do my best
The suit and ties are not impressed
So with what's left of my pride I'll carry on.
Long black train take me home
I've worn out my welcome here it's time to go
I have to face the music this just ain't where I belong
Long black train take me home.
I'm gonna trade my guitar for a ticket
Then climb aboard and ride you down the track
I know I'm licked but it's hard to admit it
Maybe some day you can bring me back
Long black train take me home
I've worn out my welcome here it's time to go
I have to face the music this just ain't where I belong
Long black train take me home.
I'd like to see the Gulf of Mexico
Are you going to Alabama
I'd like to see the old Tombigbee
Are you going to Alabama
Through the sweet southern pines
Lie down in a bed of camellia
And watch the sun shine
If you're going to Alabama
I could use a change of view
But if you're going to California
When the quiet in this old house shows no mercy
That's when your restless spirit haunts me
And I swear I hear you call my name.
I always loved the sound of your sweet voice.
But now that sound makes my poor heart break.
I pray when I pass on over
That we will meet in the place where lost souls stay.
Maybe then when I look over my shoulder
You'll be there when I hear you call my name.
I always loved the sound of your sweet voice.
But now that sound makes my poor heart break.
Broke into my world and tore it apart
Broke into my world and tore it apart
But he ain't worth a single tear that falls from my eye
So why do I still love him anyway
Broke into my world and tore it apart
I found a letter that you wrote me
It said I was your one and only
And you would never ever leave my loving arms
But the truth is all that matters
Your pretty words no longer flatter
I found your guitar in the closet
I remember when you bought it
And how you serenaded me under the stars
Now there's no one here to play it
But the songs didn't come from your heart
I hoped my search was through
I found your ring still on my finger
It's been there since we saw the preacher
Even though it didn't come from your heart
I've heard it said life leaves you
Memories that are precious
If that's true it hasn't left me any yet
There are none that I've thought of
For me it's easier to forget.
Looking back is not the way
Remembering only brings me regret
When I dig up the past
I find a love that didn't last
So for me it's easier to forget.
I'd hate to think these memories I've been given
Are the only ones I'm ever gonna get
For me it's easier to forget.
Looking back is not the way
Remembering only brings me regret
When I dig up the past
I find a love that didn't last
So for me it's easier to forget.
I found your bag this morning
Did you pack it by yourself
If you would've asked me
I'd have given you some help
I hate to disappoint you
You would soon be leaving
So I beat you to the punch
I've already set you free
I'm glad you're finally going
If you had changed your mind
So you don't have to sneak out
You're not going to let me down
That's already happened
I've already set you free
Day light has found me here again
You can ask me anything but where I've been
The things that used to matter seem so small
When you're looking for a soft place to fall
Don't misunderstand me baby please
I didn't mean to bring back memories
You should know the reason why I called
I was looking for a soft place to fall
Looking for a soft place
Nothing more than a small taste
Of a love that ended long ago
Looking for a place to hide
A warm bed on a cold night
I didn't mean to hurt you oh no
Looking out your window at the dawn
Baby when you wake up I'll be gone
Your the one who taught me after all
How to find a soft place to fall
Your the one who taught me after all
How long I'm gonna cry
How long I'm gonna sigh for you
Do you remember the promises you made me
I need you and I want you so
What are you gonna do
You better hope that I don't leave you lonely
I need you and I want you so
How long I'm gonna cry
How long I'm gonna sigh for you
Do you remember the promises you made me
Heard the preacher at the service
Declare you'd gone home that day
To meet the Maker and His servants
And take a rest amidst His grace.
He said now that you're in Heaven
But I didn't hear him mention
If Heaven's good enough for you.
He claimed you feel no more sorrow
But can the blessed on God's mountain
I was raised not to question
But how could the Almighty
Did the Lord's illumination
Shine upon you from His throne
When He witnessed my sweet angel
If there's really no more teardrops
Send me down some reassurance.
I don't believe what I've been told.
If there really is a Kingdom
Where you start your life anew
Won't you please somehow convince me
Children say that words will never harm you
Only sticks and stones will make you cry
But they'll grow up one day
And learn the real truth
When the one they love says goodbye.
The hardest part of living is loving
And the hardest part of leaving is living
Life is hard when love is so unkind
Life is hard when love is so unkind.
I don't trust old sayings any longer
Most are only decorated lies
Absence doesn't make the heart grow fonder
And out of sight don't mean out of mind.
The hardest part of living is loving
And the hardest part of leaving is living
Life is hard when love is so unkind
When the first hint of sunshine peeks
Between the window blinds
And the morning hits my pillow
The sweetest dream is left behind.
I'd rather die than face a new day
That I'm feeling just as lonely
As the day you said goodbye.
Can you feel me reaching for you
What I'd give to hold you darling
Within these arms of mine.
All my heartache would be over
If my dream came true one time.
Then I wouldn't have to live with
But that ain't what I say
It's been like this ever since you told me goodbye
And I've refused to lose these blues
But it's time I tried.
It's time I tried to mend my broken heart
I have to heal this hurt I feel
And get you off my mind
It might be hard but it's time I tried.
All I do is long for you
When I turn out the lights
To hold onto at night
I toss and turn while my heart yearns
For love I've been denied
I can't replace your warm embrace
I'm alright without you anyway
But just because I say the words
Don't mean I think they're true
It's just that it's the best that I can do
I don't go to places you might be
I can't take the chance that we might meet
But just because I've stayed away
Don't mean I wanted to
It's just that it's the best that I can do
I can't let you know how hurt I've been
I wish I had you back with me
But I won't play on your sympathy
To get you in my arms once again
I admit there are others I have seen
Sometimes I need the company
But just because I'm loving them
Don't mean I'm over you
You crawl back tonight saying you miss me
With your tail between your legs
What's going on here ain't no mystery
Settling down won't come natural
I hear you found someone who's true
That she treats you fine
Now that poor girl's love won't do
And you're wanting some of mine
Settling down won't come natural
I know why you cheat on me
Every time I turn my back
Every woman loves a bit differently
That's what keeps you going
That's what keeps you trapped
Don't tell me you've learned your lesson
Unless you really want to quit
It takes more than a confession
For an old dog to learn new tricks
Settling down won't come natural
Please don't bring me flowers
Tied up in a pretty bow
I'd trade a thousand roses
For just one hand to hold
And I don't want no candy
All I want is you tonight
That'd be really sweet
Your kiss is the only gift
That means a thing to me
That's something you ain't tried
And I'll be satisfied
Written fancy on a card
Scribbled on my heart
And I won't wear a new dress
From a downtown store
But wrap me up in your arms
Your kiss is the only gift
That means a thing to me
That's something you ain't tried
And I'll be satisfied
Your kiss is the only gift
That means a thing to me
That's something you can't buy
And I'll give you all of mine
Throw your presents in the creek
Between the two of us
Let's close the curtain
The price we are paying
The damage being done
The both of us staying
Then you're the only one
When it comes to love
Why I stand by my man
Won't you send down an angel
From the blue to show me
The righteous thing to do
I'm not the praying kind but
It can't hurt to try.
I can't find the answer by myself
You've finally gone and done it
Broke it right in two
There's no way you can fix it
So pocket your excuse
Don't tell me that you're sorry
That'll only make it worse
I'm tired of your story
I know it word for word
I make no bones about it
Stupid is as stupid does
I had to learn the hard way
You're a man that I can't trust
If only I'd known sooner
I was gonna be betrayed
I would've left the first time
I didn't mean to break your heart
If you'll just give me
There'll be no next time
I promise I will never break your heart
I'll pick up both the pieces
You know that I love you
Once more for old time's sake
I didn't mean to break your heart
If you'll just give me
There'll be no next time
I promise I will never break your heart
The moment these lips said I'm leaving
I felt in my heart I was wrong
But I told myself I might as well
Since I already spent nights alone
I thought I had put it behind me
Guess that's why I'm so surprised
When I ran into you tonight
I'm feeling that feeling again
Exactly like I did back then
Would take one more chance with you
There was a good reason why
I had to tell you goodbye
It's not love that I'm in
Now I'm lying here like I used to
Lonesome as a young widowed bride
A question is burning inside
Were we made for each other
To walk through the fire hand in hand
But I'm feeling that feeling again
I'm feeling that feeling again
Exactly like I did back then
What happened to the world we painted
The masterpiece of me and you
Our work of art has all but failed
It was a stroke of genius
Yeah just as pretty as you please
But all that's left between us
Is hanging on what used to be.
Looking at it from a distance
I still can't believe my eyes
It's sad to have to witness
What we made on all those nights
The summer days are gone
Along with you they disappeared
Just like the falling leaves
I watched you turn and drift away
Don't want to face the fall alone
But it's your nature to move on.
Is it cold in California
Like I told you it would be
Do you need someone to warm you
Is it cold in California
Like it is in Tennessee.
Spent the holidays with a man
Made out of snow ho ho ho
Kept on building fires
But they don't ease the chill
This has been the hardest time
Winter has the longest nights.
I'll count the days until the spring
And hope it brings you back to me.
Is it cold in California
Like I told you it would be
Do you need someone to warm you
Is it cold in California
Sometimes in the mornings
I wake up devastated that you're gone
It drives me kinda crazy
And I tell myself it's been a little long
To still be expecting you
To call me up on the phone
I don't like holding on
Sometimes a photograph of you
Will take my breath away
I don't think that time's a healer
No matter what folks say
How can years fly by so fast
And breaks in a heart mend so slow
I don't like holding on
Sometimes I'm in a room full of people
When old lonely sits by me
And it makes me sad to realize
That unlike you he won't ever leave
I wish I had some kind of pill
To take this feeling from my bones
A harlot who was hot to trot
Gave a fine little bijoux to the world
With a blacksmith for a makeshift doc
Her goldmine brought to bear a baby girl
When the child screamed from life's first slap
And she wrapped her babe in a petticoat
Grabbed a bottle and made a toast
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
While her mama puffed a Chinese pipe
The salad days for Ruby didn't last
Forced to work and pay her dues
Night and day she toiled and sweat
While brothel patrons placed their bets
On who would be the first to break her in
Then one night the madam screams
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
She climbed the stairs scared to death
Said a prayer and tiptoed through the door
But on deaf ears her prayer fell
Cause through a tear she stared at hell
Standing there in nothing but his drawers
She recognized the whiskered chin
He was the man who wore the silver star
She tried to turn around and run
But he pulled out his big six gun
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
Ruby Jewel woke up in bed
A crimson pool between her legs
Naked as the day that she was born
But lying there next to him
Made her wish she hadn't been
If this was all that living had in store
Making sure he was asleep
She quietly got to her feet
Found his gun and aimed it between his eyes
She kept it there till he came to
So he could stare down the barrel too
Pulled the trigger once and watched him die
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
On a rainy night in 1912
Locked inside the town's new jail
Ruby carved a message in the stone
When morning came hacks lead her out
In ankle chains right through the crowd
Who waited in the mud to watch the show
They walked her up the gallows steps
And put the rope around her neck
Dropped the trap as all the watchers cheered
But on the wall of a cell
In a tiny scrawl and misspelled
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
You can't get there from here
I can't live on bread and water
You heard the one about the farmer's daughter
She just needs a little atmosphere
You don't pick your occupation
I didn't ask for this frustration
I need a life and a nice cold beer
But you can't get there from here
If I had time to think about it
I'd build a castle in the yard
For all the things I want so much
Always something I can't touch
But I guess that would be too hard
You can't get there from here
I can't live on bread and water
You heard the one about the farmer's daughter
She just needs a little atmosphere
You don't pick your occupation
I didn't ask for this frustration
I need a life and a nice cold beer
But you can't get there from here
I'm on a road that's going nowhere
Looking for a place that I belong
The wind's pushing me in all directions
But none of them look like home
And you can't get there from here
You can't live on bread and water
You heard the one about the farmer's daughter
She just needs a little atmosphere
Every right track turns out wrong
A different tune but the same old song
I need a life and a nice cold beer
But you can't get there from here
If the moon could conceal
How it feels when it shines
And the stars could disguise
The beauty the skies reveal
Then the fire I try to hide in my heart
Would remain out of sight
Here with you in the dark
Before tomorrow comes
Daybreak might take this all away
And rob the east of morning's light
Before it steals tonight
Being kissed tenderly
Lips so soft and sweet
Touching my cheek like this
But choose to give in
The only way I can lose
Is if this feeling ends
Before tomorrow comes
Daybreak might take this all away
And rob the east of morning's light
I'm skipping across the stars
Hopping from moon to moon
Higher than a kite's been before
Up this high in outer space
Old cloud nine looks commonplace
Floating way down there in the blue
Up this high at heaven's door
Worlds collide and comets soar
Your love lets me fly up this high.
A lot of astronauts have left the planet Earth
But they use rocket ships to kiss the sky
I don't have what they got
But I sail the universe
Every time your lips are kissing mine.
Up this high in outer space
Old cloud nine looks commonplace
Floating way down there in the blue
Up this high at heaven's door
Worlds collide and comets soar
Your love lets me fly up this high.
Back when I was green
But when I got off I never left the ground
Now you can't find me unless you own a telescope
And I don't wanna ever come back down
Up this high in outer space
Old cloud nine looks commonplace
Floating way down there in the blue
Up this high at heaven's door
Worlds collide and comets soar
Your love lets me fly up this high.
Don't you look pretty
Comfortably sitting on your gold mine
Come to mess up my world.
All of the ladies are watching their backs
The boys thinking maybe they might stand a chance
They don't know who you are
But they sure know your name.
Hey Jezebel leave mine alone
Ain't no bombshell wrecking my home
He's all I got he's all I want
Jezebel find someone else
A woman who's fallen and keeps going down
I won't compete with your dirty work
So get back to the street
Hey Jezebel leave mine alone
Ain't no bombshell wrecking my home
He's all I got he's all I want
Jezebel find someone else
This southern belle is tough as nails
You'll change your mind
But I wanted you to see what you meant to me
Turns out that wasn't smart
A sleeve is no place for a heart.
Wish I could take back the secret that I told you
But I let down my guard
A sleeve is no place for a heart.
Take one last look before it's gone
It's time I put it back where it belongs
Next time I will know not to let my feelings show
I'll keep them in the dark
I know a magical place to get a taste of a little heaven on earth
It's just a watering hole but many a soul go there to quench their thirst
See it's Tony's joint and he makes it a point to let every poor bum get lit
He's a drunk's patron saint and he won't hesitate to fix you some supper for free
Each morning at eight it opens its gates for all my buddies and me
With our foots on the rail and our buckets of ale we tell stories no one believes
We spit and we cuss at the lives that left us then toast to our freedom with glee
I sit tight each night till they turn up the lights empty my last one and leave
Then squint my eyes at the dawn in the sky as people walk by on the street
God only knows where it is they go but there's only one place for me
I was living in the lap of the gods
But Miss Fortune turned the tables
And turned out all the lights
Now there's no chance in hell I'll beat the odds.
I'm going down going down
Down down down I'm going down.
At what was in the cards
Played fast and loose
But a joker who is wild like me
Can't beat the old graveyard
If he's staring at a dead man's hand.
I'm going down going down
Down down down I'm going down.
It felt good to gamble with my soul
Everybody one day has to fold.
I'm going down going down
Down down down I'm going down.
I'm going down going down
Down down down I'm going down.
I take a pint of whiskey
And crack open its lid
I drink the bottle empty
Just like my poor daddy did.
I take after my family
My fate's the blood in me
No one grows old in this household
We are a dying breed.
I take a red and blue one
To see what kicks in first
I take after my family
My fate's the blood in me
No one grows old in this household
We are a dying breed.
I take another needle
Black powder and a spoon
I set my sights on heaven
And shoot for the moon.
I take after my family
My fate's the blood in me
No one grows old in this household
When my liquor cabinet is empty
And the local package store is closed
I am paid a visit by an enemy
He loves showing up out of nowhere
And getting under my skin
The sad thing is he's going to stay there
If I don't score again
Bully Jones Bully Jones Bully Jones
Someday I'm gonna beat him
He'll kill me if I don't
But until I can defeat him
I'll keep on getting stoned
Bully Jones Bully Jones Bully Jones
Big bad dude sure ain't very pretty
His ugly is awfully hard to take
He looks just like a cold turkey
With a real bad case of the shakes
He don't pick on men his own size
He knows he can't win with those
He likes us pale and sick guys
Who are only skin and bones
Bully Jones Bully Jones Bully Jones
Someday I'm gonna beat him
He'll kill me if I don't
But until I can defeat him
I'll keep on getting stoned
Bully Jones Bully Jones Bully Jones
I got some good friends who tie off
And some who tie one on
And just like me they have all lost
Bully Jones Bully Jones Bully Jones
Someday I'm gonna beat him
He'll kill me if I don't
But until I can defeat him
I'll keep on getting stoned
When the first hint of sunshine peeks
Between the window blinds
And the morning hits my pillow
The sweetest dream is left behind.
I'd rather die than face a new day
That I'm feeling just as lonely
As the day you said goodbye.
Can you feel me reaching for you
What I'd give to hold you darling
Within these arms of mine.
All my heartache would be over
If my dream came true one time.
Then I wouldn't have to live with
Don't cry no tears around me
Don't cry no tears around me
The feeling lingers on
Ain't too hard to see
Don't cry no tears around me.
But there's nothing I can say
Ain't too hard to see
Don't cry no tears around me.
There's nothing I can say
Ain't too hard to see
Don't cry no tears around me
I'd like to see the Gulf of Mexico
Are you going to Alabama
I'd like to see the old Tombigbee
Are you going to Alabama
Through the sweet southern pines
Lie down in a bed of camellia
And watch the sun shine
If you're going to Alabama
I could use a change of view
But if you're going to California
Day light has found me here again
You can ask me anything but where I've been
The things that used to matter seem so small
When you're looking for a soft place to fall
Don't misunderstand me baby please
I didn't mean to bring back memories
You should know the reason why I called
I was looking for a soft place to fall
Looking for a soft place
Nothing more than a small taste
Of a love that ended long ago
Looking for a place to hide
A warm bed on a cold night
I didn't mean to hurt you oh no
Looking out your window at the dawn
Baby when you wake up I'll be gone
Your the one who taught me after all
How to find a soft place to fall
Your the one who taught me after all
I know a magical place to get a taste of a little heaven on earth
It's just a watering hole but many a soul go there to quench their thirst
See it's Tony's joint and he makes it a point to let every poor bum get lit
He's a drunk's patron saint and he won't hesitate to fix you some supper for free
Each morning at eight it opens its gates for all my buddies and me
With our foots on the rail and our buckets of ale we tell stories no one believes
We spit and we cuss at the lives that left us then toast to our freedom with glee
I sit tight each night till they turn up the lights empty my last one and leave
Then squint my eyes at the dawn in the sky as people walk by on the street
God only knows where it is they go but there's only one place for me
It wears on my patience when I talk to those deejays
At the corporation station they slather on false praise
Even though I'm slow I know no radio will give my record spins
Way up in those ivory towers with gold records on the walls
All the big wigs got the power but they ain't got the balls
The desk bound clowns that run this town
Have watered down the sound just like their gin
Hell yeah I'd love to make it but I suck at playing games
I'd rather starve than fake it for a little taste of fame
It's wrong to be a doggone pawn singing songs that make
Sometimes in the mornings
I wake up devastated that you're gone
It drives me kinda crazy
And I tell myself it's been a little long
To still be expecting you
To call me up on the phone
I don't like holding on
Sometimes a photograph of you
Will take my breath away
I don't think that time's a healer
No matter what folks say
How can years fly by so fast
And breaks in a heart mend so slow
I don't like holding on
Sometimes I'm in a room full of people
When old lonely sits by me
And it makes me sad to realize
That unlike you he won't ever leave
I wish I had some kind of pill
To take this feeling from my bones
If the moon could conceal
How it feels when it shines
And the stars could disguise
The beauty the skies reveal
Then the fire I try to hide in my heart
Would remain out of sight
Here with you in the dark
Before tomorrow comes
Daybreak might take this all away
And rob the east of morning's light
Before it steals tonight
Being kissed tenderly
Lips so soft and sweet
Touching my cheek like this
But choose to give in
The only way I can lose
Is if this feeling ends
Before tomorrow comes
Daybreak might take this all away
And rob the east of morning's light
Please don't bring me flowers
Tied up in a pretty bow
I'd trade a thousand roses
For just one hand to hold
And I don't want no candy
All I want is you tonight
That'd be really sweet
Your kiss is the only gift
That means a thing to me
That's something you ain't tried
And I'll be satisfied
Written fancy on a card
Scribbled on my heart
And I won't wear a new dress
From a downtown store
But wrap me up in your arms
Your kiss is the only gift
That means a thing to me
That's something you ain't tried
And I'll be satisfied
Your kiss is the only gift
That means a thing to me
That's something you can't buy
And I'll give you all of mine
Throw your presents in the creek
Heard the preacher at the service
Declare you'd gone home that day
To meet the Maker and His servants
And take a rest amidst His grace.
He said now that you're in Heaven
But I didn't hear him mention
If Heaven's good enough for you.
He claimed you feel no more sorrow
But can the blessed on God's mountain
I was raised not to question
But how could the Almighty
Did the Lord's illumination
Shine upon you from His throne
When He witnessed my sweet angel
If there's really no more teardrops
Send me down some reassurance.
I don't believe what I've been told.
If there really is a Kingdom
Where you start your life anew
Won't you please somehow convince me
I was living in the lap of the gods
But Miss Fortune turned the tables
And turned out all the lights
Now there's no chance in hell I'll beat the odds.
I'm going down going down
Down down down I'm going down.
At what was in the cards
Played fast and loose
But a joker who is wild like me
Can't beat the old graveyard
If he's staring at a dead man's hand.
I'm going down going down
Down down down I'm going down.
It felt good to gamble with my soul
Everybody one day has to fold.
I'm going down going down
Down down down I'm going down.
I'm going down going down
Down down down I'm going down.
When it comes to love
Why I stand by my man
Won't you send down an angel
From the blue to show me
The righteous thing to do
I'm not the praying kind but
It can't hurt to try.
I can't find the answer by myself
I take a pint of whiskey
And crack open its lid
I drink the bottle empty
Just like my poor daddy did.
I take after my family
My fate's the blood in me
No one grows old in this household
We are a dying breed.
I take a red and blue one
To see what kicks in first
I take after my family
My fate's the blood in me
No one grows old in this household
We are a dying breed.
I take another needle
Black powder and a spoon
I set my sights on heaven
And shoot for the moon.
I take after my family
My fate's the blood in me
No one grows old in this household
You've finally gone and done it
Broke it right in two
There's no way you can fix it
So pocket your excuse
Don't tell me that you're sorry
That'll only make it worse
I'm tired of your story
I know it word for word
I make no bones about it
Stupid is as stupid does
I had to learn the hard way
You're a man that I can't trust
If only I'd known sooner
I was gonna be betrayed
I would've left the first time
I didn't mean to break your heart
If you'll just give me
There'll be no next time
I promise I will never break your heart
I'll pick up both the pieces
You know that I love you
Once more for old time's sake
I didn't mean to break your heart
If you'll just give me
There'll be no next time
I promise I will never break your heart
When my liquor cabinet is empty
And the local package store is closed
I am paid a visit by an enemy
He loves showing up out of nowhere
And getting under my skin
The sad thing is he's going to stay there
If I don't score again
Bully Jones Bully Jones Bully Jones

Bully Jones Bully Jones Bully Jones

But until I can defeat him
I'll keep on getting stoned
I always toss it in when things get heavy
But a lady has a right to change her mind
I ain't giving up on you
I ain't giving up on you
By owning up to this I'm breaking the promise
I made when I was on the losing end
To tell the truth it's hard being honest
When there is something else that might break again
I ain't giving up on you
I ain't giving up on you
The tin horn's jumping off the deep end
All I want to do is break even
And you're the best chance I got
I ain't giving up on you
There's a foreign movie
Up on your silver screen
Black and white and silent
If you don't count the screams
From where you are sitting
Everyone who's seen it
Knows the way you feel
Wipe the sleep from your eyes
Look behind the curtain
Such a beautiful sunrise
Sometimes a flight of fancy
Falls down from the clouds
You don't have to worry
Wipe the sleep from your eyes
Look behind the curtain
Melancholy Polly spills her guts on stage
She can't get her jollies any other way
Safe inside the music and the melody
Polly gets to lose it and no one can see
She is not a starlet with a red guitar
Just an easy target for a broken heart
Peddling her story up there all alone
Is another allegory carved in stone
She would ransom her fate
If she had some escape
But her words are a curse
Every rhyme every line and verse
In front of the footlights Polly takes a bow
Waves and says her goodnight to the drunken crowd
When the house is clapping she knows what it means
The cuckoo clock quit chirping
The bird fell out and died
Spent its whole life working
And never learned to fly
A man jumped in the river
In his religious fervor
Forgot he couldn't swim
No one saved his skin
I want to believe in you
I want to believe I do
A woman works the corner
Of Hollywood and Vine
No one can afford her
Cause her love is blind
I want to believe in you
Mister bartender I'm speaking the truth
When I tell you my mouth is bone dry
I'd love four fingers of your hundred proof
But I've run smack dab into hard times
Wasted my fortune on having a ball
Hit the bottle like a calf at a cow
Do me a favor and gimme one on the house
Can't say I'm proud of this life of mine
But begging is brand new to me
I cross my heart I'll buy you one next time
As soon as I'm back on my feet
Mister bartender you won't be the first
To hear what I say and have doubts
You can question my honesty but not my thirst
Do me a favor and gimme one on the house
Gimme one on the house
I'm just a poor soul who wants to get soused
Bandwagon rides for free
Satisfaction guaranteed
Fall in line and let it take you farther
Hurry up they're going fast
This special offer will not last
All aboard yells the main street barker
All aboard all aboard
All aboard all aboard
Sign up and get a flag
Wear it proudly you can brag
To the fools who didn't volunteer
Some restrictions do apply
Watch your mouth and close you eyes
And we allow no yellow foreign queers
All aboard all aboard
All aboard all aboard
A team of old white studs
Pulls this rolling country club
Climb right on in and take a seat
Down the beaten path we'll run
High stepping to the drummer's drum
And if you don't love it you can leave
All aboard all aboard
In this cemetery mist
Stands a newborn atheist
You're far from almighty
Flesh and blood's a sissy fist
Death's a gold glove pugilist
And everyday it's hit or miss
That's what I believe
I stared at my polished shoes
In front of your wooden pews
Prayed and prayed don't let me lose
No healing hands were ever used
Faithfulness was my excuse
Tell me what was yours
I don't know how many rounds
And there's no telling where I'm bound
But one thing I'm sure of
The king of kings has lost his crown
It's buried here in marble town
In the god forsaken ground
Joyrides for the pain
Sparkling in your brain
Swallowing up your days
All you have is what you need
All you make are enemies
Can't believe what went wrong
Who is the monster in the mirror
You've never seen it any clearer
Looking for the lost and found
Make it hard to come back home
Got tired of southern charm
And traded in his lonesome badge
For a lady on his arm
In a god box by the sea
Aimed only with an ancient tongue
And a gut string on his knee
Louise is in the blue moon
Walking on rocky socks
Punching numbers on a juke
The handsome riverboat gambler
Is holed up in some motel
He's dealing with new players
Who know the game real well
He left it on the road
And even though he'll miss it
Louise is in the blue moon
She's walking on rocky socks
Just getting by is getting old
Locked up inside this pigeonhole
Breaking my back with my bare hands
Some of us can't some of us can
I don't have it in me
And in the land of plenty
Not a lion on the sun
Here underground way too long
Losing my mind digging for gold
All I can find as life unfolds is
I don't have it in me
And in the land of plenty
Not a lion in the sun
The ending won't be a happy one
As a child I wept I was afraid
That if I slept I would not wake
But slumber came until the dawn
When Mama sang a bedtime song
Now as darkness falls on my last day
Casting a pall on where I lay
Let me make one last request
Before I take eternal rest
Sing me to sleep while I close my eyes
A soft and sweet lullaby
I'm asking please don't say goodbye
Day light has found me here again
You can ask me anything but where I've been
The things that used to matter seem so small
When you're looking for a soft place to fall
Don't misunderstand me baby please
I didn't mean to bring back memories
You should know the reason why I called
I was looking for a soft place to fall
Looking for a soft place
Nothing more than a small taste
Of a love that ended long ago
Looking for a place to hide
A warm bed on a cold night
I didn't mean to hurt you oh no
Looking out your window at the dawn
Baby when you wake up I'll be gone
Your the one who taught me after all
How to find a soft place to fall
Your the one who taught me after all
I've been walking these mean streets
Hard concrete beneath my feet
Ain't found a friendly face among the crowd
The city's like a Christmas tree
A light for every dreamer's dream
But it seems mine has finally burned out.
Long black train take me home
I've worn out my welcome here it's time to go
I have to face the music this just ain't where I belong
Long black train take me home.
When I thought that I'd be making
A name for myself in Babylon
Though I've tried to do my best
The suit and ties are not impressed
So with what's left of my pride I'll carry on.
Long black train take me home
I've worn out my welcome here it's time to go
I have to face the music this just ain't where I belong
Long black train take me home.
I'm gonna trade my guitar for a ticket
Then climb aboard and ride you down the track
I know I'm licked but it's hard to admit it
Maybe some day you can bring me back
Long black train take me home
I've worn out my welcome here it's time to go
I have to face the music this just ain't where I belong
Long black train take me home.
I'd like to see the Gulf of Mexico
Are you going to Alabama
I'd like to see the old Tombigbee
Are you going to Alabama
Through the sweet southern pines
Lie down in a bed of camellia
And watch the sun shine
If you're going to Alabama
I could use a change of view
But if you're going to California
I found your bag this morning
Did you pack it by yourself
If you would've asked me
I'd have given you some help
I hate to disappoint you
You would soon be leaving
So I beat you to the punch
I've already set you free
I'm glad you're finally going
If you had changed your mind
So you don't have to sneak out
You're not going to let me down
That's already happened
I've already set you free
I've heard it said life leaves you
Memories that are precious
If that's true it hasn't left me any yet
There are none that I've thought of
For me it's easier to forget.
Looking back is not the way
Remembering only brings me regret
When I dig up the past
I find a love that didn't last
So for me it's easier to forget.
I'd hate to think these memories I've been given
Are the only ones I'm ever gonna get
For me it's easier to forget.
Looking back is not the way
Remembering only brings me regret
When I dig up the past
I find a love that didn't last
So for me it's easier to forget.
Children say that words will never harm you
Only sticks and stones will make you cry
But they'll grow up one day
And learn the real truth
When the one they love says goodbye.
The hardest part of living is loving
And the hardest part of leaving is living
Life is hard when love is so unkind
Life is hard when love is so unkind.
I don't trust old sayings any longer
Most are only decorated lies
Absence doesn't make the heart grow fonder
And out of sight don't mean out of mind.
The hardest part of living is loving
And the hardest part of leaving is living
Life is hard when love is so unkind
Between the two of us
Let's close the curtain
The price we are paying
The damage being done
The both of us staying
Then you're the only one
When it comes to love
Why I stand by my man
Won't you send down an angel
From the blue to show me
The righteous thing to do
I'm not the praying kind but
It can't hurt to try.
I can't find the answer by myself
I've been a moonshiner for seventeen long years
I spent all my money on whiskey and beers
I go to some hollow and put up my still
I'll make you one gallon for two dollar bill
I go to some grocery and drink with my friends
No women to follow to see what I spent
God bless those women I wish they were mine
Their breath smells as sweet as the dew on the vine
I'll eat when I'm hungry and drink when I'm dry
If moonshine don't kill me I'll live till I die
Till I meet my maker don't know where I'll dwell
What happened to the world we painted
The masterpiece of me and you
Our work of art has all but failed
It was a stroke of genius
Yeah just as pretty as you please
But all that's left between us
Is hanging on what used to be.
Looking at it from a distance
I still can't believe my eyes
It's sad to have to witness
What we made on all those nights
Don't you look pretty
Comfortably sitting on your gold mine
Come to mess up my world.
All of the ladies are watching their backs
The boys thinking maybe they might stand a chance
They don't know who you are
But they sure know your name.
Hey Jezebel leave mine alone
Ain't no bombshell wrecking my home
He's all I got he's all I want
Jezebel find someone else
A woman who's fallen and keeps going down
I won't compete with your dirty work
So get back to the street
Hey Jezebel leave mine alone
Ain't no bombshell wrecking my home
He's all I got he's all I want
Jezebel find someone else
This southern belle is tough as nails
If the moon could conceal
How it feels when it shines
And the stars could disguise
The beauty the skies reveal
Then the fire I try to hide in my heart
Would remain out of sight
Here with you in the dark
Before tomorrow comes
Daybreak might take this all away
And rob the east of morning's light
Before it steals tonight
Being kissed tenderly
Lips so soft and sweet
Touching my cheek like this
But choose to give in
The only way I can lose
Is if this feeling ends
Before tomorrow comes
Daybreak might take this all away
And rob the east of morning's light
I take a pint of whiskey
And crack open its lid
I drink the bottle empty
Just like my poor daddy did.
I take after my family
My fate's the blood in me
No one grows old in this household
We are a dying breed.
I take a red and blue one
To see what kicks in first

I set my sights on heaven
And shoot for the moon.
I take after my family
My fate's the blood in me
No one grows old in this household
Bad times all pass with the wind
Your hand in mine stills the thunder
And you make the sun want to shine
You followed me down so many roads baby
I've picked wild flowers and sung you soft sad songs
And every road we took God knows
Our search was for the truth
And the clouds brewing now won't be the last
Bad times all pass with the wind
Your hand in mine stills the thunder
And you make the sun want to shine
Bad times all pass with the wind
Your hand in mine stills the thunder
Don't cry no tears around me
Don't cry no tears around me
The feeling lingers on
Ain't too hard to see
Don't cry no tears around me.
But there's nothing I can say
Ain't too hard to see
Don't cry no tears around me.
There's nothing I can say
Ain't too hard to see
Don't cry no tears around me
Sometimes in the mornings
I wake up devastated that you're gone
It drives me kinda crazy
And I tell myself it's been a little long

Will take my breath away

To take this feeling from my bones
It wears on my patience when I talk to those deejays
At the corporation station they slather on false praise
Even though I'm slow I know no radio will give my record spins
Way up in those ivory towers with gold records on the walls
All the big wigs got the power but they ain't got the balls
The desk bound clowns that run this town
Have watered down the sound just like their gin
Hell yeah I'd love to make it but I suck at playing games
I'd rather starve than fake it for a little taste of fame
It's wrong to be a doggone pawn singing songs that make
Heard the preacher at the service
Declare you'd gone home that day

Won't you please somehow convince me
I got a lot of work to do
Got to give you back your point of view
So I got a lot of work to do
I got a lot of space to fill
So I got a lot of space to fill
It seems like every time I turn around
Over and over again I let you tell me
How I'm not good enough
Don't hold the truth I know
If it takes time of mine
I got a lot of work to do
Got to give you back your point of view
Sometimes I don't know if should even talk at all
Words just fall to pieces banging up against the wall
They don't ever come out right now matter how much I try
I can say what I feel inside
I don't want to hide the things I need to tell you
I stumble so out in my throat
I guess you'll never know.
If I could I'd plant a seed and make a blossom grow
Lets colors flow around you and maybe they would show you the way
To my world and what I feel inside.
I don't want to hide and the things I need to tell you
I stumble so out in my throat
I guess you'll never know.
The things I need to tell you
I stumble so out in my throat
I've heard there was a secret chord
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
I used to live alone before I knew you.
It's a cold and it is a broken Hallelujah
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
But all that I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you.
And it is not somebody who has seen the light
It's a cold and it is a broken Hallelujah
This time I'm gone forever
I should have seen it coming from a mile away
I guess I wasn't counting on a rainy day
Soon as I could swear the sky was falling down
You were out of ever falling head to ground
This time I'm gone forever
I'm lighter than a feather
I'm really like a flower in a hurricane
But sending us a shower wash away my pain
Clouds are blowing over everything is fine
Rainbow on my shoulder in a sweet sunshine
This time I'm gone forever
I'm lighter than a feather
This time I'm gone forever
I'm lighter than a feather
And starts another day in hell
She don't make a sound
I don't know how she does it
One handed her a coffee cup
One to get the babies in the car
Singing with the radio so she don't fall apart
It's just a broken heart
I don't know how she does it
Finally into town the old familiar red light shining in her eyes
She usually makes a right to work but turns it to the left
If the light in your sky fades and darkness falls upon your face
When it seems you've lost your way and you can't take another day
I will calm all your fears
I will dry all your tears
You'll see it doesn't matter near or far
Right next door or to the stars
My heart's already where you are
There's no wall that I can't climb
No road that I won't walk to find
Where you wander in the cold I'll get to you and take you home
I'll be right by your side just forget space and time
You'll see it doesn't matter near or far
Right next door or to the stars
My heart's already where you are
I'll be right by your side just forget time and space
You'll see it doesn't matter near or far
Right next door or to the stars
Mockingbird singing a tune
No one knows she's got the blues
Paying no mind to the ground
Ain't nothing gonna bring her down
It's just her and the sky
She's right where she needs to be
She's right where she needs to be
For watching the world rolling by
Taking her riddance on high
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
I fell into a ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
And the flames went higher
I fell into a burning ring of fire
And the flames went higher
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
I fell into a burning ring of fire
And the flames went higher
I fell into a burning ring of fire
And the flames went higher higher higher
She is addicted to thee
She is the root connection
She is connecting with he
Here I go and I don't know why
I fell so ceaselessly
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine
She is the essence of thee
She is concentrating on he
Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine
She intoxicated by thee
She has the slow sensation
That he is levitating with she
Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine
I want some sugar in my bowl
I want a little sweetness
Feel so lonely and I feel so sad
I want a little steam on my clothes
Maybe I could fix things up so they'll go
Drop a little sugar in my bowl
Drop a little sugar in my bowl
Well I want a little sugar in my bowl
Well I want a little sweetness down in my soul
You been acting strangely I've been told
I want some sugar in my bowl
I want a little steam on my clothes
Maybe I can fix things up so they'll go
Drop a little sugar in my bowl
Or at least she is stronger
She will make it last longer
No more am I for the taking
But I can't say that my heart's not aching
When we laughed a lot
Those they weren't so good
We could sit and talk till words
Not just for days or weeks or months
But could it be you were stalling
Hearts have a way of calling
I'm not what I'm supposed to be
And left me a mule to ride
But every word seemed to date her
And all the spindles whine
And everyday is getting straighter
Where I can sleep out every night
Queen of fakes and imitators
Rows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would've done
The clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's clouds illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairytale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave them laughing when you go
Don't give yourself away
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
Ain't got nobody to tell my troubles to
Come all you broken hearted come
And lay your burden down
Surrender up your crown
To ride the orphan train
It'll take you all the way home
That brings you to the door
But love awaits there to embrace
Your heart forevermore
It'll take you all the way home
Come refugees left homesick for
Some place you've never known
And saints are all the same
No more or less than God's beloved
Child aboard this train
It'll take you all the way home
I put my ear to the track and I heard my name
I'm looking for blue eyes
I'm looking for blue eyes
Cause something tells me
There was a time when blue eyes said he'd love no other
His one and only love he swore I'd be
There was a time when his blue eyes saw clearer than mine did
Looking for blue eyes
I'm looking for blue eyes
Cause something tells me
I'm looking for blue eyes
I found your bag this morning
Did you pack it by yourself
If you would've asked me
I'd have given you some help
I hate to disappoint you
You would soon be leaving
So I beat you to the punch
I've already set you free
I'm glad you're finally going
If you had changed your mind
So you don't have to sneak out
You're not going to let me down
That's already happened
I've already set you free
Day light has found me here again
You can ask me anything but where I've been
The things that used to matter seem so small
When you're looking for a soft place to fall
Don't misunderstand me baby please
I didn't mean to bring back memories
You should know the reason why I called
I was looking for a soft place to fall
Looking for a soft place
Nothing more than a small taste
Of a love that ended long ago
Looking for a place to hide
A warm bed on a cold night
I didn't mean to hurt you oh no
Looking out your window at the dawn
Baby when you wake up I'll be gone
Your the one who taught me after all
How to find a soft place to fall
Your the one who taught me after all
I'd like to see the Gulf of Mexico
Are you going to Alabama
I'd like to see the old Tombigbee
Are you going to Alabama
Through the sweet southern pines
Lie down in a bed of camellia
And watch the sun shine
If you're going to Alabama
I could use a change of view
But if you're going to California
Broke into my world and tore it apart
Broke into my world and tore it apart
But he ain't worth a single tear that falls from my eye
So why do I still love him anyway
Broke into my world and tore it apart
Children say that words will never harm you
Only sticks and stones will make you cry
But they'll grow up one day
And learn the real truth
When the one they love says goodbye.
The hardest part of living is loving
And the hardest part of leaving is living
Life is hard when love is so unkind
Life is hard when love is so unkind.
I don't trust old sayings any longer
Most are only decorated lies
Absence doesn't make the heart grow fonder
And out of sight don't mean out of mind.
The hardest part of living is loving
And the hardest part of leaving is living
Life is hard when love is so unkind
When it comes to love
Why I stand by my man
Won't you send down an angel
From the blue to show me
The righteous thing to do
I'm not the praying kind but
It can't hurt to try.
I can't find the answer by myself
Between the two of us
Let's close the curtain
The price we are paying
The damage being done
The both of us staying
Then you're the only one
You've finally gone and done it
Broke it right in two
There's no way you can fix it
So pocket your excuse
Don't tell me that you're sorry
That'll only make it worse
I'm tired of your story
I know it word for word
I make no bones about it
Stupid is as stupid does
I had to learn the hard way
You're a man that I can't trust
If only I'd known sooner
I was gonna be betrayed
I would've left the first time
I didn't mean to break your heart
If you'll just give me
There'll be no next time
I promise I will never break your heart
I'll pick up both the pieces
You know that I love you
Once more for old time's sake
I didn't mean to break your heart
If you'll just give me
There'll be no next time
I promise I will never break your heart
When the first hint of sunshine peeks
Between the window blinds
And the morning hits my pillow
The sweetest dream is left behind.
I'd rather die than face a new day
That I'm feeling just as lonely
As the day you said goodbye.
Can you feel me reaching for you
What I'd give to hold you darling
Within these arms of mine.
All my heartache would be over
If my dream came true one time.
Then I wouldn't have to live with
You crawl back tonight saying you miss me
With your tail between your legs
What's going on here ain't no mystery
Settling down won't come natural
I hear you found someone who's true
That she treats you fine
Now that poor girl's love won't do
And you're wanting some of mine
Settling down won't come natural
I know why you cheat on me
Every time I turn my back
Every woman loves a bit differently
That's what keeps you going
That's what keeps you trapped
Don't tell me you've learned your lesson
Unless you really want to quit
It takes more than a confession
For an old dog to learn new tricks
Settling down won't come natural
A harlot who was hot to trot
Gave a fine little bijoux to the world
With a blacksmith for a makeshift doc
Her goldmine brought to bear a baby girl
When the child screamed from life's first slap
And she wrapped her babe in a petticoat
Grabbed a bottle and made a toast
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
While her mama puffed a Chinese pipe
The salad days for Ruby didn't last
Forced to work and pay her dues
Night and day she toiled and sweat
While brothel patrons placed their bets
On who would be the first to break her in
Then one night the madam screams
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
She climbed the stairs scared to death
Said a prayer and tiptoed through the door
But on deaf ears her prayer fell
Cause through a tear she stared at hell
Standing there in nothing but his drawers
She recognized the whiskered chin
He was the man who wore the silver star
She tried to turn around and run
But he pulled out his big six gun
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
Ruby Jewel woke up in bed
A crimson pool between her legs
Naked as the day that she was born
But lying there next to him
Made her wish she hadn't been
If this was all that living had in store
Making sure he was asleep
She quietly got to her feet
Found his gun and aimed it between his eyes
She kept it there till he came to
So he could stare down the barrel too
Pulled the trigger once and watched him die
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
On a rainy night in 1912
Locked inside the town's new jail
Ruby carved a message in the stone
When morning came hacks lead her out
In ankle chains right through the crowd
Who waited in the mud to watch the show
They walked her up the gallows steps
And put the rope around her neck
Dropped the trap as all the watchers cheered
But on the wall of a cell
In a tiny scrawl and misspelled
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
What happened to the world we painted
The masterpiece of me and you
Our work of art has all but failed
It was a stroke of genius
Yeah just as pretty as you please
But all that's left between us
Is hanging on what used to be.
Looking at it from a distance
I still can't believe my eyes
It's sad to have to witness
What we made on all those nights
I take a pint of whiskey
And crack open its lid
I drink the bottle empty
Just like my poor daddy did.
I take after my family
My fate's the blood in me
No one grows old in this household
We are a dying breed.
I take a red and blue one
To see what kicks in first
I take after my family
My fate's the blood in me
No one grows old in this household
We are a dying breed.
I take another needle
Black powder and a spoon
I set my sights on heaven
And shoot for the moon.
I take after my family
My fate's the blood in me
No one grows old in this household
You'll change your mind
Sometimes in the mornings
I wake up devastated that you're gone
It drives me kinda crazy
And I tell myself it's been a little long
To still be expecting you
To call me up on the phone
I don't like holding on
Sometimes a photograph of you
Will take my breath away
I don't think that time's a healer
No matter what folks say
How can years fly by so fast
And breaks in a heart mend so slow
I don't like holding on
Sometimes I'm in a room full of people
When old lonely sits by me
And it makes me sad to realize
That unlike you he won't ever leave
I wish I had some kind of pill
To take this feeling from my bones
Heard the preacher at the service
Declare you'd gone home that day
To meet the Maker and His servants
And take a rest amidst His grace.
He said now that you're in Heaven
But I didn't hear him mention
If Heaven's good enough for you.
He claimed you feel no more sorrow
But can the blessed on God's mountain
I was raised not to question
But how could the Almighty
Did the Lord's illumination
Shine upon you from His throne
When He witnessed my sweet angel
If there's really no more teardrops
Send me down some reassurance.
I don't believe what I've been told.
If there really is a Kingdom
Where you start your life anew
Won't you please somehow convince me
The moment these lips said I'm leaving
I felt in my heart I was wrong
But I told myself I might as well
Since I already spent nights alone
I thought I had put it behind me
Guess that's why I'm so surprised
When I ran into you tonight
I'm feeling that feeling again
Exactly like I did back then
Would take one more chance with you
There was a good reason why
I had to tell you goodbye
It's not love that I'm in
Now I'm lying here like I used to
Lonesome as a young widowed bride
A question is burning inside
Were we made for each other
To walk through the fire hand in hand
But I'm feeling that feeling again
I'm feeling that feeling again
Exactly like I did back then
The night was hot and steamy
And crickets played their tune
Everyone was sleeping
Except one man that sat awake
Regretting that he'd thrown away
A slave to the bottle
He'd driven his family to leave
A wife and two daughters
He treated so terribly
Drunk with grief and loneliness
He wasn't thinking straight
He knew he couldn't live unless
They pardoned his mistakes
He went into the city
To try to make amends
Asked his love for pity
But she would not give in
Overwhelmed with sadness
He reached for his gun
And took her life along with his
Before the morning sun
Fall down on me like a feather
Faintest whisper softest calling
Lead me to the ledge and let me
I just hang on hear me praying
Look for heaven out the window
Scattered pearly shimmer sending
Helping hasten hope's return
To free me from your grasp
I just hang on hear me praying
Can I beg can I borrow
Can I steal one more tomorrow
The day is done another wasted
Why do I spend them all waiting
What is here what was never
What will last what's gone forever
Twists and turns then it splinters
One day sweet next day bitter
Take a breath then take another
One last step take cover
Time is short unfurl my fingers
Shine a light where darkness lingers
She's not that kind of girl
She reserves the right to be sullen
Yeah she still thinks it's cool
Ooh she ain't gonna let you in
Fool she ain't ever gonna break her
Rule and if you try you're just another
She can feel your stare
And knows you're standing there
Waiting for a chance to win her favor
But she just sips her wine
With all of the others trying to save her
Ooh she ain't gonna let you in
Fool she ain't ever gonna break her
Rule and if you try you're just another
I know it's hard to resist
The taste of her kiss
She won't let down her guard no matter what you do
Ooh she ain't gonna let you in
Fool she ain't ever gonna break her
Rule and if you try you're just another
Storms gather in her head some days
All the happy is replaced
Bath of raindrops falling down her face
And every step she makes feels like a mistake
Don't watch her don't see her
But she'll never say a word
Same old songs playing in her brain
And a melody runs through her veins
Day after day sifting through remains
Don't watch her don't see her
But she'll never say a word
Who broke her in too many pieces
Storms gather in her head sometimes
All the sun is pushed aside
By the clouds that creep into her mind
And it ain't alright but she looks for the light
Don't watch her don't see her
But she'll never say a word
Should I be concerned
That my thoughts are dark that I fall apart over nothing
And each sunset brings regret that another day will soon be dawning
Should I be concerned
That I'd rather stay in bed all day than get up
And face the fact you're not coming back
And nothing will ever be the same
Maybe I should call someone
Maybe I don't need to be alone
Maybe I just need someone
Should I be disturbed
That my every move is outside the groove what am I thinking
I might as well let it all go to hell what difference would it make
When you wake up feeling bad
Makes you wonder when the glad
Could have met and made friends with mad
When you wake up feeling bad
When you wake up feeling old
And your bones and your blood have turned cold
All the bread in the kitchen's grown mold
When you wake up feeling old
Just slipped away in the night
That kept all of your dreams alive
When you wake up feeling dead
Devil's demons inside your head
Can't even get out of the bed
When you wake up feeling dead
Sissy got her fishing pole
Went down to the honey hole
Greasy fiery frying pan
Viola grabbed it with her hand
It burned so bad her skin it peeled
There I saw the truth revealed
Watermelon tastes so good
Bare feet on the cool hardwood
Summer dresses Nanny made
Cut off blue jeans torn and frayed
Swinging on the barnyard gate
It don't get dark till after eight
Run inside a kiss and hug
Wrapped up in my mama's love
Firefly whispered in my ear
Fly down to the creek with me
There's something you gotta see
The stars come out and glow so bright
That's why I don't mess with morning light
Easy in the summertime
Easy in the summertime
If I don't move an inch if I don't make a sound
Maybe you'll forget and decide to stick around
Even though I know it's hopeless at best
I'm gonna fool myself
While you're still this side of gone
While you're still this side of gone
When did you decide I wasn't good enough
I wish I had known instead of getting my hopes up
They're hanging by a thread heavy in the air
But let them linger there
While you're still this side of gone
While you're still this side of gone
Till I'm a little stronger
Nothing I can say nothing I can do
I'm down on my knees calling on St. Jude
And send a miracle my way
While you're still this side of gone
Rain falls on my roof
Doing what it's meant to do
Forever lost to the ground
Hangs around in the sky
Then lets go when it's time
It doesn't mind coming down
To make the flowers grow
And make the rivers flow
It doesn't need to know
Where it's gonna land
I don't care where I stand
I'd rather be like the rain
To make the flowers grow
And make the rivers flow
It doesn't need to know
Where it's gonna land
I'm through making plans
I don't care where I stand
I gotta turn you away so I can keep this hope alive
You're tapping on the window but I won't let you inside
Maybe you'll give up and find somebody else tonight
I draw the curtains say a prayer and turn out the light
Sorrow get away from my door
Don't come around here
I won't welcome you in
From now on you're a stranger
I used to let you crawl right in make yourself at home
You'd burrow underneath my skin and wrap around my bones
But you've worn out your welcome so just walk on past this house
You ain't getting in here and I ain't coming out
Sorrow get away from my door
Don't come around here
I won't welcome you in
From now on you're a stranger
I'm finally feeling strong
But I ain't made of stone
I ain't going down again
Sorrow get away from my door
Don't come around here
I won't welcome you in
From now on you're a stranger
Simple things you just can't seem to keep a hold on
All alone facing a door that never opened
If the blues have you convinced the end is certain
It's gonna feel good when it stops hurting
Summer chills then early frost as you get older
If the blues has you convinced the end is certain
It's gonna feel good when it stops hurting
Every prayer you've prayed and wish you've made
I close my eyes and I listen
And try to get out of the way
But when I look out the window
Is it him that I hear laughing
Taunting me making me blush
Acting like he knows my secrets
The crow in the yard is trying to tell me something
I see him out there trying to catch my eye
He's not the magnificent raven
He caws a much creepier caw
So comfortable there in his murder
So why won't he just give me the message
What's the worst news he could bring
And I make a mess when I'm guessing
The crow in the yard is trying to tell me something
I see him out there trying to catch my eye
Black as the night he shines like a light on nothing
Ain't no use in trying to hide
I guess a crow in the yard
It's been a long dark night
And I've been waiting for the morning
It's been a long hard fight
But I see a brand new day dawning
I've been looking for the sunshine
You know I ain't seen it in so long
That's been all wrong
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
It's been a long long time
Since I've known the taste of freedom
I've been like a captured eagle
You know an eagle's born to fly
And now that I have won my freedom
Like an eagle I'm eager for the sky
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
Love is where you find it
When you find no love at home
After the fire is gone
The bottle is almost empty
The clock just now struck ten
To our favorite place again
We know it's wrong for us to meet
But the fire's gone out at home
After the fire is gone
Love is where you find it
When you find no love at home
After the fire is gone
Your lips are warm and tender
Your arms hold me just right
Sweet words of love you remember
That the one at home forgot
Each time we say is the last time
After the fire is gone
Love is where you find it
When you find no love at home
And a smallpox blanket to keep us warm
On a 747 on the pentagon lawn
Anthrax lab on a west Virginia farm
Shorty ain't learned to walk already heavily armed
Civilians and little children is especially harmed
The books that take you to heaven and let you meet the Lord there
The rich must be blind because they didn't see the poor there
Can you please call the fire department they're down here marching for freedom
The more money that they make
The more money that they make
The better and better they live
Whatever they want to take
Whatever they want to take
The more that you want to learn
The more that you try to learn
The better and better it gets
Turn their whole culture to a mockery
The night was hot and steamy
And crickets played their tune
Everyone was sleeping
Except one man that sat awake
Regretting that he'd thrown away
A slave to the bottle
He'd driven his family to leave
A wife and two daughters
He treated so terribly
Drunk with grief and loneliness
He wasn't thinking straight
He knew he couldn't live
Unless they pardoned his mistakes
He went into the city
To try to make amends
Asked his love for pity
But she would not give in
Overwhelmed with sadness
He reached for his gun
And took her life along with his
Before the morning sun
I heard that you were getting married
I always knew that you'd do well
You're a legendary beauty
From our small provincial town
Two important families
I followed in the morning papers
How exciting it has been
The courtship and the whirlwind romance
For the sweetest of beauty queens
And nothing matters more than that
And you'll never be poor no more
How she looked when she passed by
How she looked when she passed by
I feel like I'm watching history
Living before my eyes
We'll recall just how
How she looked when she passed by
I know that you are in there somewhere
Letters get misplaced in the mail
Guess that there was some confusion
Amidst those throngs and swells
How she looked when she passed by
How she looked when she passed by
Feel like I'm watching history
Living before my eyes
We'll recall just how
There's people walking
Every man's got a woman
I tossed a coin into the wishing well
Send me somebody to love
What a beautiful sight
I say a prayer to the lord above
Send me somebody to love
Send me somebody to love
And I believe it's true
For the fortunate few
It's a right of passage
It's a secret of life
Creeping over my mind
Before I run out of Time
I say a prayer to the lord above
Send me somebody to love
Send me somebody to love
Maybe I'll get lucky someday
I say a prayer to the lord above
Send me somebody to love
Send me somebody to love
Send me somebody to love
Send me somebody to love
Did an hour at the batting cage.
I went home the reigning queen.
Still got hours ahead of me.
I'm at the end of my list.
To keep from missing you.
Think I need some serious help.
To keep from missing you.
Only took about a thousand sheep.
And I gave you a good talking to.
I'm at the end of my list.
To keep from missing you.
I think I need some serious help.
To keep from missing you.
I'm at the end of my list.
To keep from missing you.
To keep from missing you.
Or any other place where the crowd hangs out.
Sorry crazy just yesterday
Seems like your the one their all talking about
Tried to call a hundred times
Did you drown in all those tears
Just gotta get you on the line
You think that nobody cares for you
When your heart is sinking like a stone
I know what your going though
Oh this morning I've been picturing you
In your lonely room with the shades pulled down
Caught up in all the bitter thoughts
I know the last thing you want is someone coming around
When its time to talk it out
I'll be standing at your door
Whatever you need you can count on me
You think that nobody cares for you
When your heart is sinking like a stone
I know what your going through
I've been down that road your on
When I swore it will never end
It's gonna take some time
But before you know it
You'll be back on your feet again
You think that nobody cares for you
When your heart is sinking like a stone
I know what your going through
My heart starts imagining
That it's you on the line
Saying please me mine
I wanna give you everything
My mind starts picturing
Oh every time the phone rings
Wanna know more than anything
Oh it could be you boy
My body starts tingling
I get shivers down my spine
When it's you on the line
I get a little weak in the knees
To the words my mama taught me
And I'll carry them deep in my soul
You make in your life
I want to run and hide
And just deny that voice inside
But it's never under oath
In my life of the truth
Nothing can get to you
If they all may disagree
And I'll carry them deep in my soul
Everywhere he wanted to go
He read a book or two
And he thought he knew
Everything he needed to know
Whatever will be will be
With the simple philosophy
If you're gonna dream
If you wanna be heard
Cause time is a curse
Some will surely fall by their way
But we're gonna find a place in the sun
Well I'm not a teacher
Love's alive in the city
Soon I'll be sitting pretty
I'm gonna break new ground
The road ahead don't scare me
Cause the future's mine to hold
Cause you don't know what it's like
Yeah to walk in my shoes
In a world so brand new
For a girl that's getting there it's so unclear
So I make a left turn
When everyone goes right
Yeah I dress kinda funny
And stay up all night
But I know I'll find the way
Cause you don't know what it's like
Yeah to walk in my shoes
In a world so brand new
For a girl that's getting there it's so unclear
I'll make my own mistakes and sweet success
I'm not here to recreate your yesterday's best
One by one when it's done half the fun is getting there
Cause you don't know what it's like
Yeah to walk in my shoes
In a world so brand new
For a girl that's getting there it's so unclear
Open sense and tell me that I am getting there
Open sense and tell me that I am getting there
But most of the time I can see through you
You say I'm too sweet for my own good
While you're riding you're knocked down
There are things that you can't see
And one of them is me
You've been walking in a paper rain
There is a storm inside your head
Come down from your cloud and walk my way
And let the paper rain
Tell me what I should do
When you want to paint a day every shade of blue
Is it too late for us to shine
Can you crawl into the light and just be mine
Your world of words is so unreal
Sometimes I wonder if you feel
The same emotions that I do
When I'm close to you
You've been walking in a paper rain
There is a storm inside your head
Come down from your cloud and walk my way
And let the paper rain
Will the fervor disappear and then I come crashing in
Crashing in to the light of day
You've been walking in a paper rain
There is a storm inside your head
Come down from your cloud and walk my way
And let the paper rain
You've been walking in a paper rain
There is a storm inside your head
Come down from your cloud and walk my way
You've been walking in a paper rain
Storm inside your head
Come down from your cloud and walk my way
And let the paper rain
Can't find the sounds
The dreams you want most are the ones that get lost
I close my eyes the room goes round
In a river of tears falling down on the ground
Every time I walk away
Something you say always pulls me back
And I see my whole life right before my eyes
Every time I try to break away baby it's no lie
When I look into your eyes
You pull me close but you're miles away
Without your love my heart gets cold
The things I held near were the things that you stole
Every time I walk away
Something you say always pulls me back
And I see my whole life right before my eyes
Every time I try to break away baby it's no lie
When I look into your eyes
Every time I think about it I cry
Every time I walk away
Something you say always pulls me back
And I see my whole life right before my eyes
Every time I try to break away baby it's no lie
When I look into your eyes
In the blink of an eye
Sparks fly and fires die
Some things weren't meant to last
No you won't be the first
To break that heart of hers
And you won't be the last
So let her go let her go let her go
Let her go let her go let her go
She'll get over it in time
One less burden on her mind
When those tears drop from her face
Someone else will take your place
And she'll be over you for good
So let her go let her go let her go
Try to tell her goodbye
Oh no your mouth goes dry
And your heart start to sink
Then you look in her eyes
Oh you just might be surprised
She's stronger than you think
So let her go let her go let her go
Let her go let her go let her go
She'll get over it in time
One less burden on her mind
When those tears drop from her face
Someone else will take your place
And she'll be over you for good
You can't take forever
She'll get over you in time
So let her go let her go let her go
She'll get over it in time
One less burden on her mind
When those tears drop from her face
Someone else will take your place
With a crowd around you
Till the show is over
Then you fall so hard
I'll run to your side
When you're lost in the dark
When you're out in the cold
When you're looking for something that resembles your soul
When the wind blows your house of cards
I'll be a home to your homeless heart
Leave your secrets with me
Just like walls around you
Come in from the rain
In the wrong direction
When you're lost in the dark
When you're out in the cold
When you're looking for something that resembles your soul
When the wind blows your house of cards
I'll be a home to your homeless heart
Shattered like a mirror
To find you and save you
When you're lost in the dark
When you're out in the cold
When you're looking for something that resembles your soul
When the wind blows your house of cards
I'll be a home to your homeless heart
When you're looking for something that resembles your soul
When the wind blows your house of cards
I'll be a home to your homeless heart
Am I holding out for a dream
Is this a little girl fantasy
Is there somebody only for me
Wanting too good to be true
Anticipating it's time
Waiting for my star to fall
Have we met or are you unseen
Will you believe that we are mean to be
Won't you come into my reality
Will I find the right words to say
Would it make a difference anyway
Anticipating it's time
Waiting for my star to fall
I wish upon a star that you'll be mine
Waiting for my star to fall
Waiting for my star to fall
Real life is just a little too real tonight
Think I'm gonna hop a jet plane
Go where things work out right
Some place far away from here
Like a song on the radio
Everything just peace and love and stuff like that
I wish life could be like a song on the radio
You just turn it on and turn it up yeah
Think I'm gonna hop a freight train
Find out where it's at
Some place far away from here
Like a song on the radio
Everything just peace and love and stuff like that
I wish life could be like a song on the radio
You just turn it on and turn it up yeah
When life doesn't go my way
Some place far away from here
Like a song on the radio
Everything just peace and love and stuff like that
I wish life could be like a song on the radio
You just turn it on and turn it up
Like a song on the radio
Everything just peace and love and stuff like that
I wish life could be like a song on the radio
You just turn it on and turn it up yeah
Yeah I know you and you know me all too well
You can tell what I'm thinking before I can even pretend
Yeah we've begun and we've been down time and again
And again and again and again and again and again
Sometimes it feels like I don't need your touch
Sometimes it's just too much
And I come tumbling down like a house of cards
Whenever you take your love away
And the sweet sweet sound of your voice
Is all it seems to take
Yeah I've played games and I've been played before
I've been to the bottom and back and I know how it feels
And better than that I can tell and I try to believe
Sometimes it feels like I don't need your touch
Sometimes it's just too much
And I come tumbling down like a house of cards
Whenever you take your love away
And the sweet sweet sound of your voice
Is all it seems to take
Like a house of cards
When I come down I come down hard
Oh and when I fall I fall so hard
Yeah we've begun and we've been down time and again
And again and again and again
And again and again and again and again and again and again
And I come tumbling down like a house of cards
Whenever you take your love away
And the sweet sweet sound of your voice
Is all it seems to take
And I come tumbling down like a house of cards
Whenever you take your love away
And the sweet sweet sound of your voice
Is all it seems to take
You're my beautiful friend with so much to give
But you hide it all away and don't really live
Maybe tomorrow you'll say you'll live right now
I don't wanna hear those words again
Life can be unpredictable
When I kiss the sun on your face
It feels like a moment of grace
And I can see everything clearly
Tonight I feel your love so undeniably real
Now it's you everyday that I wanna run to
I never knew my heart had wings
I never knew my soul could fly
And I can see everything clearly
Tonight I feel your love so undeniably real
Maybe your love is my yellow brick road
I can never lose my way
Tonight I feel your love so undeniably real
Down this frozen river under uncertain skies
I walk and I wonder of the how's and whys
And I try to remember why it started this way
And how much farther I have to go in the cold light of day
There are bridges to cross and there's someone to be
I wait in the water as the stream rushes by
I go deeper and deeper and I wish I could fly
Far from this moment and away from my past
How I feel or what goes on inside me
When the world is crashing down around you
When you feel no arms of love surround you
He will be your guide.
Feel His embrace rushing down like the rain
Turn up your face and thank your Heavenly Father
For He will lift you up
And he longs to bear it for you
His love will soon reveal the plans He has in store for you
Feel His embrace rushing down like the rain
Turn up your face and thank your Heavenly Father
For He will lift you up
Feel His embrace rushing down like the rain
Turn up your face and thank your Heavenly Father
For He will lift you up
Me and my best friend Louise got it all figured out
She's got the car and I've got the stereo
I'm saving my dollars that used to be dimes
That this girl's gonna move out
He thinks I'm gonna throw wild parties every night and start drinking
That's what he's thinking
There ain't gonna be no problem at all
Me and my best friend Louise got it all figured out
She's got the car and I've got the stereo
I'm saving my dollars that used to be dimes
That this girl's gonna move out
All I know is that it's gonna be great and all my friends think we're so cool
Monday morning we're signing the lease
Wednesday we're getting our phone
Friday night we're throwing a party going all night long
Me and my best friend Louise got it all figured out
She's got the car and I've got the stereo
I'm saving my dollars that used to be dimes
That this girl's gonna move out
I did my best to hold onto
My promise of forever
Well you don't even care
I'm tired of your lies
And I caught your act
When you don't give Jack
I held my arms wide open for you
When you needed shelter
Now you've gone and done me wrong
You hit the hand that held you
I'm tired of your lies
And I caught your act
When you don't give Jack
It ain't the road for me
Someday you'll know what you had
When you come to your senses
But you can't have my love again
Unless you're reminiscing
I'm tired of your lies
And I caught your act
When you don't give Jack
I don't guess I've ever been in love before
I know that this is my first time
But I know that I want to make you mine
So if you'll promise me forever
Our love to have and to hold
Promise we'll always ride together
Down love's rocky road
I want the first to last
A lifetime full of love is all I ask
I want the fire to burn
Well it won't take that much to please me
You give your heart and I'll give mine
I want the first to last
A lifetime full of love is all I ask
I want the fire to burn
I know you're that special one
I feel like my life has just begun
And our love will never end
I want the first to last
A lifetime full of love is all I ask
I want the fire to burn
I can't remember back then
To the time when I was lonely
Oh thanks to you I'm no longer blue
I can't remember back then
To the time when I was lonely
Oh thanks to you I'm no longer blue
You looked like you saw a ghost
The moment she walked in
I knew there was someone else
I've often wondered who she was
And was she really gone
And where does that leave me
Is she still in your heart
Will you tell me goodbye
The looks you're giving her
You say there's no reason at all
As long as there's a little smoke
If history repeats itself
What does our future hold
And where does that leave me
Is she still in your heart
Will you tell me goodbye
Will you tell me goodbye
See the pyramids along the Nile
Watch the sunrise on a tropic isle
See the marketplace in old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
I'll be so alone without you
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
I'll be so alone without you
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Stop that knocking on my front door
I know what you're up to now
Flashing that smile around
I know what you're doing to me
I know that you're the heartbreak kind
Well honey you almost fooled me
But I wised up just in time
One step from a heartache
Two steps from the blues
So close to a teardrop
I know what you were gonna do
But I'm one step ahead of you
Don't be calling me on the phone
I'm hanging up if you do
I know you only been putting me on
But honey I'm on to you
I let down my defenses
When I saw those big brown eyes
But I came to my senses
Just in the nick of time
One step from a heartache
Two steps from the blues
So close to a teardrop
I know what you were gonna do
But I'm one step ahead of you
One step from a heartache
Two steps from the blues
So close to a teardrop
I know what you were gonna do
But I'm one step ahead of you
One step from a heartache
Two steps from the blues
So close to a teardrop
I know what you were gonna do
Well I've heard you're just the one I'm looking for
And everywhere I go you know I hear it a little more
But honey I think I heard it from my heart
Rumor says I'm crazy over you
Well I've got to check the source before I say one word is true
But I think I heard it from my heart this time
I think I heard it from my heart
A subtle whisper soft and low
But loud enough to let me know
It's time to say I love you
And honey that's where I'll start
And you can say you heard it from my heart
Good news travels fast and I've been told
Talk is cheap but what I've said is worth it's weight in gold
Once I finally heard it from my heart
I think I heard it from my heart
A subtle whisper soft and low
But loud enough to let me know
It's time to say I love you
And honey that's where I'll start
And you can say you heard it from my heart
I think I heard it from my heart
A subtle whisper soft and low
But loud enough to let me know
It's time to say I love you
And honey that's where I'll start
I've been tossing and turning all night
I've lost all my appetite
And there's nothing I can do
Since the moment I laid eyes on you
This can't be happening
You'd think I'd know by now
What I'm getting into
I just can't help myself
This feeling's got me
Feeling out of control
To turn my heart around
There's no way to stop
Is to hope it all works out right
All I know now is how
I feel in your arms tonight
This can't be happening
You'd think I'd know by now
What I'm getting into
I just can't help myself
This feeling's got me
Feeling out of control
She was sixteen and he was twenty
She'd never strayed from that small town
Her daddy said you know
That kind don't ever settle down
She took a job down at the diner
She'd laugh when he would say
I'm gonna marry you someday
Little did that young girl realize
Some things are meant to happen
Some things are bound to be
Love has a way of making doubting hearts believe
Sometimes in spite of difference
Sometimes against all odds
Some things are meant to happen
It's written in the stars
He chased his dreams out on the circuit
She went on with her small town life
But when that cowboy came back home
He wouldn't leave her heart alone
Till she fell into his arms one starry night
Some things are meant to happen
Some things are bound to be
Love has a way of making doubting hearts believe
Sometimes in spite of difference
Sometimes against all odds
Some things are meant to happen
It's written in the stars
They bought a house in town
And had a baby boy named Joe
Bought him a rocking horse
So he could ride the rodeo
Some things are meant to happen
Some things are bound to be
Love has a way of making doubting hearts believe
Sometimes in spite of difference
Sometimes against all odds
Some things are meant to happen
You take me to a world I never thought I'd see
Your eyes can touch my soul
And fill me with a hunger only you can feed
When you speak my name
Your words of love surround me like a gentle rain
You whisper soft and clear
The things I long to hear
It's like an angel's sweet refrain
When you speak my name
There's no love like our love
Our passion knows no end
Together we can soar to heights
That no one's ever known
You fill my mind with dreams of pleasures yet to be
You take me in your arms
There's no love like our love
Our passion knows no end
Together we can soar to heights
That no one's ever known
You take me to a world I never thought I'd see
Your eyes can touch my soul
And fill me with a hunger only you can feed
I tried to give up on love
No matter how hard I tried
It didn't do me no good
I just stopped cold turkey
There were pieces of my heart all over town
When I got out of bed
But what I saw outside my window
Was like a kick in the head
I felt the cold chills begin
When I saw that truck pull up
He lives twelve steps down
In the apartment below
He's got what it takes to tempt a woman
And if I fall I ain't got far to go
He lives twelve steps down
I tried to get a better look
So I sneaked downstairs
And just three steps from the bottom
I saw him standing there
Ain't it just my luck
He says he wants to be my friend
He set two glasses on the table
And he lives twelve steps down
In the apartment below
He's got what it takes to tempt a woman
And if I fall I ain't got far to go
He lives twelve steps down
He lives twelve steps down
In the apartment below
He's got what it takes to tempt a woman
And if I fall I ain't got far to go
He lives twelve steps down
He lives twelve steps down
Will steal your breath away
Mountains wear a cloak of gold
As twilight claims the day
Enchantment fills the sacred land
Where ancient mysteries began
And fire dances in the sky
When spirits walk upon the wind
You'll hear their whispers like a sigh
They'll touch your soul
As evening sings its lullaby
You'll feel the desert come alive
Its wonders never end
When fire dances in the sky
And spirits walk upon the wind
Coyotes cry and eagles scream
As night things leave their nest
Nature paints with brilliant hues
As she puts the sun to rest
Moon and stars wait patiently
To weave their magic spell again
When fire dances in the sky
And spirits walk upon the wind
You'll hear their whispers like a sigh
They'll touch your soul
As evening sings its lullaby
You'll feel the desert come alive
Its wonders never end
When fire dances in the sky
And spirits walk upon the wind
When fire dances in the sky
All this time I've searched for you
I wove a thousand fantasies
You've haunted places in my mind
Where no one else has been
And now our paths have led us
To a love that has no end
Is where I want to be
As long as you're with me
Your love has brought me happiness
That time cannot undo
And paradise will fill my life
The dream that filled my lonely nights
And given me someone to share
As years turn into memories
Our love will still remain
Till the moment passes forever
My heart will call your name
Is where I want to be
As long as you're with me
Your love has brought me happiness
That time cannot undo
And paradise will fill my life
Is where I want to be
As long as you're with me
Your love has brought me happiness
That time cannot undo
And paradise will fill my life
In the sultry heat of that august night
We both knew what was really on our minds
When we said let's take a ride
I put my hand on his knee
Then I reached up to a kiss on the cheek
He pushed on the gas and put his arm around me
To get to paper mill road
Our hearts soared high
The mill gave way to the subdivision track
The memory's still there
That's why I still go back
Our hearts soared high
He may give you diamonds on your birthday
And send you flowers now and then
He may put a new car in your driveway
Take you places you ain't ever been
He'll make you think that you're his one and only
But there's a big surprise in store for you
Except for the one he's married to
You're gonna wish you were still the other woman
You're the one who hears his alibis
And if you think you can keep him home
And the day he don't come home and make love to ya
Is when you'll know he's had enough of wedding bliss
You're gonna wish you were still the other woman
You're the one who hears his alibis
And if you think you can keep him home
You're gonna wish you were still the other woman
You're the one who hears his alibis
And if you think you can keep him home
And if you think you can keep him home
Last night like every night before
I felt your body close to mine
You woke me with a gentle kiss
And we lost all track of time
You held me tightly in your arms
As we shared ourselves till dawn
You consumed me with desire
Till I woke up all alone
This dream I dream of you
I barely close me eyes
I know if I give in to you
And leave me with that old refrain
Just one night of love
Today I saw you on the street
And desire filled my mind
I longed to have your touch again
And leave all doubts behind
But you still wore her wedding ring
And my conscience took control
I'd give all I've got to be with you
But I won't give up my soul
This dream I dream of you
I barely close me eyes
I know if I give in to you
And leave me with that old refrain
Just one night of love
Stands at the edge of town
Its weathered boards could use a coat of paint
It was a famous boarding house
Back in my daddy's day
That's been more than twenty years ago
Now it's a home for runaways
At the house of fallen angels
You'll find someone to ease your weary mind
There'll be a meal and a bed where you can lay your head
She never turns away a stranger
From the house of fallen angels
Miss June still wears the wedding ring
Of the man who broke her heart
She closed the house the day he left
And tore her world apart
When she took a young girl in
Now she's using lessons life has taught
At the house of fallen angels
You'll find someone to ease your weary mind
There'll be a meal and a bed where you can lay your head
She never turns away a stranger
From the house of fallen angels
Wounded hearts on broken wings
No longer frightened and alone
Now she's there to guide them home
At the house of fallen angels
You'll find someone to ease your weary mind
There'll be a meal and a bed where you can lay your head
She never turns away a stranger
From the house of fallen angels
From the house of fallen angels
His eyes could melt her soul
Does he want someone to love
Is this a game she's played before
She's heard her share of bedtime tales
Should she take a chance
Could this be romance
Is it fate or midnight fantasy
He would take her home
But should she leave alone
Just another bedtime story
Her face has filled his dreams
Now he's a prisoner of her charms
And he'd give anything he's got
To hold her in his arms
As they dance around the floor
He keeps looking for a sign
If he tells her what is in his heart
Would she think it's just a lie
Should he take a chance
Could this be romance
Is it fate or midnight fantasy
He would take her home
But should he leave alone
Just another bedtime story
She could be his Cinderella
He could be her Prince Charming
Sometimes even fairy tales come true
Should they take a chance
Could this be romance
Is it fate or midnight fantasy
Should he take her home
Should they leave alone
A little boy not much more than a baby
Found a rose and picked it like a child would do
Proudly he went running to his mommy
A teenage boy packed groceries at the market
A rebel kid sometimes a little wild
But every year on Mother's Day and birthdays
He'd bring her a rose just like that little child
A single crimson rose
In time became a symbol of
Endless love shared between
A single crimson rose
Was a special way to say
I'll always love you come what may
A single crimson rose
To fight a war he felt needed to be won
Sometimes he'd write on Mother's Days and birthdays
He never failed to send a rose to mom
That soldier now is coming home a hero
With his medals to the mother that he loves
And on his casket lays a single crimson rose
A single crimson rose
In time became a symbol of
Endless love shared between
A single crimson rose
Was a special way to say
I'll always love you come what may
A single crimson rose
A single crimson rose
Was a special way to say
I'll always love you come what may
A single crimson rose
A little boy not much more than a baby
Golden hair as bright as morning sunbeams
Eyes of blue that saw into your soul
A smile that could warm a winter's evening
Or touch a broken heart and make it whole
Her laugh was like the sound of angels singing
Her voice was a gift from God above
Amie saw a world that's filled with rainbows
And never met a soul she didn't love
God must need a very special angel
Whose heart's as pure as newly fallen snow
To come and join His choir of heavenly voices
And light the way that He would have us go
And so He called our very special angel
To spread her wings and take her final bow
Let our hearts be filled with joy instead of sorrow
To know that she is there beside Him now
A need for bringing happiness to others
Could fill her days wherever she might be
And now she's singing in our memories
The life she held so dear was only just beginning
The dreams she shared will never be forgotten
For the love she left with us will never end
God must need a very special angel
Whose heart's as pure as newly fallen snow
To come and join His choir of heavenly voices
And light the way that He would have us go
And so He called our very special angel
To spread her wings and take her final bow
Let our hearts be filled with joy instead of sorrow
To know that she is there beside Him now
Let our hearts be filled with joy instead of sorrow
Through the heat as thick as the blood
And I don't think much about nothing in Carolina
But it sure feels nice
And the things I left undone
Become the things I'll never do
But my feet still slip in the mud
Just a little bit of change
Through the heat as thick as the blood
And there ain't no doubt about nothing in Carolina
Not living on bread alone
The sun looks down on another day
And these words that don't come easy now
I'll sing inside my dreams...
And the rain falls down on another day
So cold and I wanna stay
And this land that You have called me to
By faith I'll gladly go
Through this wilderness of trials
I'll known on another day
The sky fell down only yesterday
So dark that I lost my way and I went astray
But my wandering would soon take root
In everything You say
And the moon shines down on another day
So far buy I'll find my way to a brighter day
I've wandered down a thousand roads
And now I'm back where I began
I've been gone so long
But I'll stand in your light again
And the Lord looks down on another day
I've been right back down
With the weight of the world on my mind
I'm trying hard to salvage joy
In spite of circumstance
But I can't quite seem to let faith
Have the wheel this time
But if I wanna walk on water
And if I'm gonna move this mountain
I've gotta start with a little more hope
If I'm gonna take a leap of faith
Then I'd better not expect to fall
Listen to the birds sing
Do they spread their wings
I'm trying hard to trust You
So won't You feather my faith
Just a rhyme and a melody
But I promised I'd write if it took all night
They say there ain't no sleeping in heaven
So when you close your eyes
Know your mother and I
Pray the Lord your soul to keep
And we never got the chance to hold you
And we never got to tell you goodnight
So we hope you can hear as Jesus cradles you near
Are you throwing a ball against a heavenly wall
Well there's so much love between us
And so much that I wanna say
I wanna ramble awhile with my beautiful child
I could turn my back and walk away
Spurn the path and find my way again
It's my life after all
You know everybody hurts the same
It's just the way I am
But I can hear a whisper calling
Yet another promise of a love somewhere
Lighting on the summit
Of a dead man's prayer
I feel Your whisper rushing in
Like the rain You fall
In a heart that ran away
How all my efforts end the same
A debt that I could never pay alone
Cause You washed away
I wanna open up my eyes
And see a more beautiful world
Let the hand of God Almighty
Sweep his colors through my life
I wanna hold tight to the laughter
And ride it like a child
On the winds that billow joyful
I wanna open up my heart
Because I've buried it beneath the selfishness
That I've hidden behind
I wanna stand my ground unshaken
But I wanna tremble when I kneel
And let my song remain unbroken
So let me sing for the love
Let me love for the lost
Let me lose all I have
For what I found on the cross
Let me trust you with my life
Let me live to give you praise
For the grace by which I'm saved
I wanna open up Your word
And let the thirsty enter in
So they can drink deep of the water
You have given to them
I want to run the race with vigor
I want to fight the fight with strength
And let my song rise from a whisper
I wanna open up my arms
And embrace that old rugged cross
I wanna take pride in the reason
And be humbled by the cause
Lies silent in the grave
I'll sing your praise
I'll sing your praise
So let me sing for the love
Let me love for the lost
Let me lose all I have
For what I found on the cross
Let me trust you with my life
Let me live to give you praise
For the grace by which I'm saved
A promise spoken is a promise broken
Cause everything that promises to hide
Will one day step into the light
Revealing everyone is someone else inside
I stand in fear as You're coming near
And the moment when I think the end will come
I gaze with wonder when torn asunder
My heart begins to spread its wings and fly
And it soars into Your light
Revealing all I am is someone else inside
And when I try to lose perspective
And when I change my point of view
When I look at where I've come from
Next to where You've brought me to
I can't believe I'm standing here beside myself
Mercy fell to cover me
I remember how the snow fell in December
And angels flew in pageants and in dreams
And I came in at six o'clock from a long hard day of playing
There were cardboard pirate ships and mud puddle seas
And the backyard was a battleground for cowboys.
I remember how the shepherds lay in slumber
And the angels came and broke them from their dreams
As Mary raised her weary head
The world awoke to the coming of a king
There were haystacks in his palace
As a hush fell on the little town of David.
And the hillside never shined so bright
As early Christmas morning
You could almost hear the very heavens sing
And the morning light is shining in
I remember how the sunlight turned to thunder
And the people ran for shelter from the rain
And the curtain tore and the saints awoke
And the whole earth seemed to tremble
From the fury of God's anger
There were shadows on the tomb there in the garden
And the mist was rising slowly through the trees
When Mary saw the silhouette on early Easter morning
I remember how he smiled at her and said
And the morning light is shining in
Daniel hollered goodbye to the old river barge
With a dream in his head and a bride in his arms
But everyone longed to go
Six girls and a boy grew up in that Florida rain
They were carried along like leaves on a river of faith
They followed the tracks that the saints have trod
They walked in the rain of His mercy
Let it soak them down to the bone
And they splashed in its puddles
And danced in its streams as they'd go
I have slept in the house where my mother was born
And I've seen the sun set on the lake that gave birth to those storms
But I know that their house stood firm
They followed the tracks that the saints have trod
They walked in the rain of His mercy
Let it soak them down to the bone
And they splashed in its puddles
And danced in its streams as they'd go
When they sat in their home
When they walked along the road
When they slept and when they rose
The words of the Lord were impressed on their minds
And after all this time
I'm carried along like a leaf on a river of faith
I'll walk in the rain of His mercy
Let it soak me down to the bone
And I'll splash in its puddles
And dance in its streams as I go
Now and then these feet just take to wandering
Now and then I prop them up at home
Sometimes I think about the consequences
Sometimes I take my eyes off Jesus
And you know that's all it takes
Well I wish that I could say that at the close of every day
I was happy with the way that I'm behaving
The wise men chased the Child
Jacob chased her 14 years and he
Captured Rachel's smile
Moses chased the Promised Land
Joseph chased a dream
All I ever seem to chase is me
And you know you've got to pull out front to win
God knows the only time I'm winning
Is when I'm chasing Him
Well I wish that I could say that at the close of every day
I was happy with the way that I'm behaving
And he chased the Philistines
I'm not quite sure what Jonah chased
But I know he caught the sea
While Abel chased the beasts
All I ever seem to chase is me
And he chased his Father's will
He chased my sin to Calvary
And he caught it on that hill
Till his blindness made him see
Give us faith to be strong
Our bodies are fragile and weary
As we stagger and stumble to walk where you lead
Give us faith to be strong
Give us faith to be strong
Give us strength to be faithful
Give us grace to go on
Make us willing and able
Give us peace when we're torn
Mend us up when we break
This flesh can be wounded and shaking
When there's much too much trouble for one heart to take
Give us peace when we're torn
Give us faith to be strong
Give us strength to be faithful
Give us grace to go on
Make us willing and able
Give us hearts to find hope
How the sorrow we feel can bring freedom
Give us faith to be strong
Give us strength to be faithful
Give us grace to go on
Make us willing and able
Give us peace when we're torn
Driving down this road a while
Arizona's waiting on these eyes
And I think we ought to take it slow
Arizona's caught me by surprise
But the photographs don't tell it all
I see the eagle swim the canyon sea
Creation yawns in front of me
And I don't believe that I believed in you as deeply as today
And the mountains sing Your glory hallelujah
The canyons echo sweet amazing grace
The mighty gales are bellowing your name
And I've got nothing to say
I'm broken by this majesty
So much glory in so little time
So turn off the radio
Let's listen to the songs we know
All praise to Him who reigns on high
And I don't believe that I believed in you as deeply as today
And the mountains sing Your glory hallelujah
The canyons echo sweet amazing grace
The mighty gales are bellowing your name
And I've got nothing to say
And the mountains sing Your glory hallelujah
The canyons echo sweet amazing grace
The mighty gales are bellowing your name
And I've got nothing to say
Driving down this road a while
I met a man on the beach out in Panama City
Who was haggard and worn like a slave
He said his life had been sweet
And that he wasn't quitting
But he knew that today was his day.
I have drunk from every fountain in this world
I have turned each mossy stone
And have found myself alone
And he rambled on beneath the misty moon
And I've kept more than I gave
It washes and it stains
Poured out from heaven's cup
For you and me to drink it up
And in stubborn spite of my stubborn spite
I am loved nonetheless
I am loved all the more
I watched him empty out his pockets and take his shirt off
And he smiled awhile at something in his mind
It washes and it stains
Poured out from heaven's cup
For you and me to drink it up
And in stubborn spite of my stubborn spite
I am loved nonetheless
I am loved all the more
He said it would not be long till he was leaving
Then I saw this boat appear before my eyes
It washes and it stains
Poured out from heaven's cup
For you and me to drink it up
And in stubborn spite of my stubborn spite
I am loved nonetheless
I am loved all the more
And I believe there is love enough for the taking
Late one night I had a notion
An epiphany would be a better word
So I stumbled in the dark down to the ocean
And I pulled my broken heart out of the surf
I had told her I did not have much to offer
And I had told her I would treat her like a queen
But I guess I wasn't worth what I would cost her
So the night has brought me to this coral reef
So down to the water I will come
To raise for her this castle with my hands
And steal away before the morning comes
So night on night and year on year
And I let the ocean bear away my tears
So that she would know that I could love her best
And a desert's just a sea without a shore
And a lonely man at worst is still a man
And I ain't gonna cry for her no more
I often dreamed I saw her face among the people
Who'd come to see the coral fortress I had built
But it may as well have been another seagull
And the castle is there waiting for her still
So down to the water I will come
To wander through this castle on the sand
And steal away before the morning sun
Rickety fence and a rocking chair
The smell of my father's pipe
Cackling goose in the summer air
The garden is green and ripe
Suddenly now I'm far away
I'm listening to my mama saying
The farther I have wandered off
The autumn breeze is calling me away
Calling me home to Shiloh
Over the ocean the soldier sailed
The battle is finally won
His mother is pressed up against the railing
Trying to find her son
Suddenly now she sees a face
It's been years to wait for the sweet embrace
Holding him as she cries
The farther that you wander off
A sweet reunion coming through in waves
Calling him home to Shiloh
Meadow green and the river wide
Valley deep and the mountain high
I can hear my Savior saying
I can hear my Savior saying
I can hear my Savior say
Tonight in the line of the merchandise store
While they were packing up my bags
I saw the pictures of the prophets of the picket signs
And it feels like the church isn't anything more
Than the second coming of the Pharisees
They chisel epitaphs of piety
And it's raging on so silently
We forget it's being fought
It's taken me years in the race just to get this far
Still there is no end in sight
There's no end in sight
And you know I blended in just fine
Still He turns His face to me and I kiss it
Just to betray Him once again
I can feel the billows roll
With the mercy that comes thundering
O'er the waters of my soul
Tonight in the light of the gathering rain
I could hear creation groan
And a sigh rose up from the streets of the city
To the foot of Heaven's throne
It tells of the death of the one for the lives of the many
More than any picket sign could say
I remember how the snow fell in December
And angels flew in pageants and in dreams
And I came in at six o'clock from a long hard day of playing
There were cardboard pirate ships and mud puddle seas
And the backyard was a battleground for cowboys.
I remember how the shepherds lay in slumber
And the angels came and broke them from their dreams
As Mary raised her weary head
The world awoke to the coming of a king
There were haystacks in his palace
As a hush fell on the little town of David.
And the hillside never shined so bright
As early Christmas morning
You could almost hear the very heavens sing
And the morning light is shining in
I remember how the sunlight turned to thunder
And the people ran for shelter from the rain
And the curtain tore and the saints awoke
And the whole earth seemed to tremble
From the fury of God's anger
There were shadows on the tomb there in the garden
And the mist was rising slowly through the trees
When Mary saw the silhouette on early Easter morning
I remember how he smiled at her and said
And the morning light is shining in
There were ninety and nine that safely lay
In the shelter of the fold
But one was out on the hills away
Far off from the gates of gold
Away on the mountains wild and bare
Away from the tender shepherd's care
Away from the tender shepherd's care
And though the road be rough and steep
None of the ransomed ever knew
How deep were the waters crossed
Nor how dark was the night that the Lord passed though
Ere he found his sheep that was lost
Out in the desert he heard its cry
Sick and helpless and ready to die
Sick and helpless and ready to die
And up from the rocky steep
And the angels echoed around the throne
Except about how hard they are to move.
Have you ever stood before them
Like a mustard seed that's waiting for some proof.
It's brave and bittersweet.
And hope is hard to hold to
I'll see your face and Lord I'll know That only love remains.
It's brave and bittersweet.
And hope is hard to hold to
I'll see your face and Lord I'll know
I'll sing your praise and let them go cause only love
Only Your love remains
So I will drive these roads in thunder and in rain
And I will sing your song at the top of my lungs
And I will praise you dear Lord in glory and in pain.
And I will follow you till this race is won
And I will drive these roads till this motor won't run
And I will sing your song from sea to shining sea
And I will praise you Lord till your Kingdom comes
And I will follow were You lead.
I'll see your face and Lord I'll know
I'll sing your praise and let them go...
Mary picked the roses
Mary picked the roses
As the day was being born
Mary picked the roses
To smell their sweet perfume
Mary picked the roses
But Jesus made them bloom
Joseph carved a table
Joseph carved a table
It was his livelihood
Joseph carved a table
Where kings could sit to eat
Joseph carved a table
But Jesus made the tree
I'd have none if not for him
And I know whence came the tunes
Because Jesus made the roses
Jesus made the roses bloom
I will soon be leaving
I will soon be leaving
But I leave for you my songs
Though this life is fleeting
And time is no one's friend
I will soon be leaving
I'd have none if not for him
And I know whence came the tunes
Because Jesus made the roses
Jesus made the roses bloom
Lost my luggage in Kalamazoo
This is a thing that confounds me
I lose my way and I forget about You
But You still remember me
The rain that falls on the sinner and the saint.
The well that won't run dry
These mercies are made new every morning
And when I think about that prodigal son
I've got to smile when I see the old man run
And I know that You love us the same
Just as if we deserved it
Just as if every one of us fools was worth it
This rain that falls on the sinner and the saints
This well that won't run dry
These mercies are made new every morning
Isn't it love to look down from the sky
And see Your only Son on the cross asking why
And somehow let Him die that way
And not call the whole thing off
All for a man here in Kalamazoo
Who loses his bags and his way sometimes too
But that was something that You already knew
David's on his throne at sundown
His paper and his pen are in his hand
He's waiting on a song at sundown
As he gazes out across his holy land
And he thinks of old Goliath and he smiles
He can barely keep from laughing
He can hear the rivers clapping
To the same old song and dance
Well the cadence of the sea is just as steady
And the chorus of the hills is just as strong
And the faithfulness of God is just as mighty as it was
When the shepherd slew the giant with a stone
You can close your eyes and listen to the sea
You can feel the holy rhythm
Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised
For the mercy he has given
It's the same old song and dance
I can hear creation singing his praise
That his love is everlasting
It's the same as it was a million years ago
I can still hear David laughing
And the rivers are still clapping
I'd give you all of me to know what you were thinking
And if I had one wish I'd wish I wasn't sinking here
Well I've been face down and pushed aside.
Well you know I'd rather just turn tail and run
Than lie here in the sun and watch you pass me by
I've got a feeling that I'm something more
The reason I was born.
And on railroad ties. I've been passed around and cast aside
And thrown away and left alone to lie
I've got a feeling that I'm something more
The reason I was born.
Then the woman danced around and called her friends all over town
And so I find that all this time beneath the surface I could shine
Like all the gold a king and queen could measure
You see even a penny is a treasure
Every word I ever said was true
By the howling sins of history
Like Moses in the desert
When the battle ran long
We can go at this together
When my arms aren't strong
You light me up just like a birthday cake
When you walk in the room
And I just wanna make you proud
What I need you to do
Like Moses in the desert
When the battle ran long
We can go at this together
When my arms aren't strong
Every word I ever said was true
I'll do my best to try and do my very best for you
It's the very best that I can do
It's the best I can give
I said hold up my arms
Like Moses in the desert
When the battle ran long
We can go at this together
I see the thunderheads rise
And my heart is sinking
In the threatening tide
With the worries of life
And the worries of dying
On the starboard side
And these waters are rough
There's a storm cloud brewing
So let my vessel be sturdy
Let my anchor be tough
And the wind is prone to blow
I'll keep my eyes on the horizon
And keep her steady as a river
When the wild wind comes to blow
I've already been delivered
So I'll keep her steady as she goes
And my rigging is tattered
And these sails are torn
Gonna cast this cargo overboard
But I ain't setting my headings
For no change in course
Though the clouds are known to gather
And the wind is prone to blow
I'll keep her steady as a river
When the wild wind comes to blow
I've already been delivered
So I'll keep her steady as she goes
So when you can't find the faith to slumber
When you're thrown by every swell
You know that you're not going under
I wanna open up my eyes
And see a more beautiful world
Let the hand of God Almighty
Sweep his colors through my life
I wanna hold tight to the laughter
And ride it like a child
On the winds that billow joyful
I wanna open up my heart
Because I've buried it beneath the selfishness
That I've hidden behind
I wanna stand my ground unshaken
But I wanna tremble when I kneel
And let my song remain unbroken
So let me sing for the love
Let me love for the lost
Let me lose all I have
For what I found on the cross
Let me trust you with my life
Let me live to give you praise
For the grace by which I'm saved
I wanna open up Your word
And let the thirsty enter in
So they can drink deep of the water
You have given to them
I want to run the race with vigor
I want to fight the fight with strength
And let my song rise from a whisper
I wanna open up my arms
And embrace that old rugged cross
I wanna take pride in the reason
And be humbled by the cause
Lies silent in the grave
I'll sing your praise
I'll sing your praise
So let me sing for the love
Let me love for the lost
Let me lose all I have
For what I found on the cross
Let me trust you with my life
Let me live to give you praise
For the grace by which I'm saved
They say it's mighty pretty in Alaska
My daddy used to talk about those deep sea fish
So don't you turn me down
In the morning we would listen to the cattle calling
Lowing in the land of Okeechobee
Where it's flatter than the cardboard on the carport floor
And the cattails seem to wave just like they know me
Goes on about the salmon caught
The time he and his brother sailed to Juneau
The bag's already packed and in the truck
The town will see us go if we're in luck
The kids have married off and moved away
And the doctor says I'm healthy for an old man dying
Well enough to seize another day
Your bag's already packed and in the truck
There were days when I imagined that the clouds were mountains
Towering above the rolling ocean
Catching salmon of my own while I was mowing
Your bag's already packed and in the truck
The town will see us go if we're in luck
We're still a long way off
I'm just filling Junior up at Texaco
There's a schedule that we've got to keep
But every time we've made it to the show
He's laughing on the stage
And the people stop and tell me that he's fine
It's one more night at the Hampton Inn
It's breakfast on the house again
We won't make it home today
We've got shows from Boston clear to Venus
We can always make a home right here between us
And mine are on the road
And Gabe's are staring off at Kansas City
We'd all swear that it's a precious view
That's seen by such a precious few
And it'll change you just as sure as it is pretty
But that ain't a bad thing
But I have seen the tall grass bend
So I'll follow it wherever it may bring us
And as long as I've got songs to sing
I hope somebody's listening
In this world there's a whole lot of pain
In this world there's a whole lot of trouble
But a whole lot of ground to gain
It's a long enough life to be living
In this world there's a whole lot of sorrow
In this world there's a whole lot of shame
In this world there's a whole lot of sorrow
But a whole lot of ground to gain
When you spend your whole life wishing
Watching and wondering why
It's a hard enough life to be living
In this world there's a whole lot of golden
In this world there's a whole lot of plain
In this world you've a soul for a compass
And a heart for a pair of wings
There's a star on the far horizon
Rising bright in an azure sky
But with the rest of the time you've been given
Why walk when you can fly
Little Elba how's the sun in South America
Do they see in it the brilliance of the place that's been prepared
And dwell upon the hope of what's in store
Or are they just like me do they only see
An opportunity to complain about the heat
And little Elba how's the rain in South America
Does it fall upon the roof tops of the sick
Do they thank the Lord for coming up with such a great idea
And dream about a place beyond all this
Or are they just like us do they gripe and fuss
Of the nothing that you have
You're unfettered by the wealth of
Of a world that we pretend that's going to last
Well I'm weary of the spoils of my ambition
And I'm shackled by the comfort of my couch
Well I wish I had the courage to deny these of my self
And start to store my treasure in the clouds
Cause this is not my home
I do not belong where the antelope and the buffalo roam
And I'm just a little jealous
Of the nothing that you have
You're unfettered by the wealth of
Of a world that we pretend that's going to last
They say God's blessed us with plenty
I say you're blessed with poverty
Cause you never stop to wonder
Whether earth is just a little better than the land of the free
So I hope you're safe and dry in South America
But may you never be so happy that you forget about your home
Tomorrow we are Canaan bound
Where westward sails the golden sun
So bid your troubled heart be still
Like the stars across the heavens flung
Like water in the desert sprung
I trembled at the voice of God
A voice of love and thunder deep
With love He means to save us all
And Love has chosen you and me
Long after we are dead and gone
A thousand years our tale be sung
How faith compelled and bore us on
How barren Sarah bore a son
Where westward sails the golden sun
Tomorrow we are Canaan Bound
When the mandolin sang like a bird on the wing
In the hands of Bill Monroe
When Chet played guitar like a walk in the park
Like a prodigal son coming home
They spoke into being the work of their hands
From the void of the wire and the wood
And they stood on the stage
And they sang and they played
And they said that it was good
Dave is in law school for 800 years
For the sake of the sick and the poor
The work of our hands is the salt of the earth
The music we make is the light of the world
When your spirit is hovering over the deep
In the image of God just look into that darkness and speak
So let the mandolin play like a mother's embrace
Let the fiddle be warm as a smile
Let the guitar be bright as a friend at your side
When you're lost on a long lonely mile
Let the music be sweet as the washing of feet
And as gentle as a kiss
Let the love that we feel be as light as a reel
Grave offense my soul did wreak
Against creation's keeper
But see what power so fell and fair
Has stayed His holy justice
God Himself all Hell did bear
How great His love for us is
He who brings the morning
He who brings the morning
A balm upon this journey
How vast the heavens above this place
So small beneath His glory
Still He stooped and showed His face
And poured His mercy o'er me
For those who don't deserve Him
Conquered death all life to bring
So seek His face and serve Him
Praise His name forever
Praise His name forever
And the Lord I will obey
Rumbling like thunder in a dream
It roars among the pines along the lines
Of the great Mississippi
It skids across the prairie by the moon
And the name of God is the burning tune
On through the passes of the mountains it goes
As bouldered and broken as my heart
I shiver and cry and I watch as it winds
To the deepest and the darkest parts
I can get so scared in the night
My feet are cut and bleeding
With every step I feel less alive
You've been there every step along the road
From a barn in Bethlehem to Hell and back again
You blazed the trail that leads me home
On to the ocean I follow it down
Where it sizzles and boils in the waves along the sound
It's what's left of my heart
Somebody named Jesus broke it to pieces
And planted the shards
And they're coming in bloom
I can hardly believe this is all coming true
Just as I am and just as I was
He showed me the day that
He shed His own blood
All of my life I've held on to this fear
These thistles and vines ensnare and entwine
What flowers appeared
It's the fear that I'll fall one too many times
It's the fear that His love is no better than mine
Just as I am and just as I was
He showed me the day that
He shed His own blood
Well it's time now to harvest what little that grew
Has come for the fruit
And the best that I've got isn't nearly enough
I traded in my mustang for a minivan
This is not what I was headed for when I began
But everything I had to lose
Came back a thousand times in you
And you fill me up with love
And you help me stand
That's something I always knew
But I just never understood
If you'd asked me then you know I'd say I never would
Settle down in a neighborhood
I never thought I could
But I don't remember anymore
Who I even was before
You filled me up with love
Filled me up with love
And you help me stand
So come on with the thunder clouds
We can build a roof above us with the love we've found
We can stand our ground
So let the rain come down
Because love binds up what breaks in two
So keep my heart so close to you
And I'll fill you up with love
Fill you up with love
And I'll help you stand
I'm saving my vacation time
This is not what I was headed for when I began
You sent me to the shed with all the tools
I remember how you said that I could take what I could use
I got a hammer and a ratchet set
A hundred tools I ain't used yet
I remember you as quiet as a picture
Like that picture of the Navy sailor grinning for the girls
You had visited the barber
You were stationed at Pearl Harbor
A year before the War became the world's
But if you want proof that I've got you
Here running through my veins
I could show you call the sketchbooks
That I filled when I was young
And sixty years ago you did the same
Paint yourself a picture of your life.
I believe that Swedish folks were
You sent that telegraph to tell her that you missed her
And the faith you handed down has somehow stuck around
And love has called you home again
To roam again no more
You sent me to the shed with all the tools
I remember how you said that I could take what I could use
They're rusty but they work as good as new
High noon in the valley of the shadow
When the deep of the valley was bright
When the mouth of the tomb
I've been raised and redeemed
You've lost all your sting
To the victor of the battle
At high noon in the valley
In the valley of the shadow
When that last ragged breath left his lungs
And they reveled and howled
At the war that they thought they had won
The stone rolled away
In the still of the dawn on the greatest of days
High noon in the valley of the shadow
When the shadows were shot through with light
When Jesus took in that breath
And shattered all Death with his life
I've been raised and redeemed
You've lost all your sting
To the victor of the battle
High noon in the valley of the shadow
Let the people rejoice
Let the heavens resound
And freed us forever ring out
All praise to the fighter of the night
Who rides on the light
Whose gun is the grace of the God of the sky
High noon in the valley of the shadow
When the shadows were shot through with light
When the mouth of the tomb
I've been raised and redeemed
All praise to the king
The victor of the battle
High noon in the valley
It's enough to make him wonder if he's ever been sane
When he's bleating for comfort from Thy staff and Thy rod
And the heaven's only answer is the silence of God
It'll shake a man's timbers when he loses his heart
When he has to remember what broke him apart
When the crying fields are frozen by the silence of God
And if a man has got to listen to the voices of the mob
Who are reeling in the throes of all the happiness they've got
When they tell you all their troubles have been nailed up to that cross
There's a statue of Jesus on a monastery knoll
All His friends are sleeping and He's weeping all alone
What sorrow is carried by the hearts that he bought
So when the questions dissolve into the silence of God
After the last tear falls
After the last bullet tears through flesh and bone
After the last child starves
And the last girl walks the boulevard
After the last year that's just too hard
After the last disgrace
After the last lie to save some face
After the last brutal jab from a poison tongue
After the last dirty politician
After the last meal down at the mission
After the last lonely night in prison
Of love and love again
We'll see how the tears that have fallen
Were caught in the palms
Of the Giver of love and the Lover of all
And we'll look back on these tears as old tales
After the last siren wails
After the last young husband sails off to join the war
After the last young girl's innocence is stolen
After the last years of silence that won't let a heart open
Of love and love again
We'll see how the tears that have fallen
Were caught in the palms
Of the Giver of love and the Lover of all
And we'll look back on these tears as old tales
By an infant born of glory
How creation held its breath
How it let out a sigh
And it filled up the sky with the angels
So sing out with joy for the brave little boy
He gave up His pride and He came here to die
Therefore God exalted Him
To the place of highest praises
And He gave Him a name above every name
Every knee would bow in worship
You don't want me to have to tell you this ten times over
So the plagues they came upon Egypt one by one
His heart was hard and the other nine just couldn't move it
He said their firstborn sons would live to see another day
That night all of the children of Israel prayed
Don't let your sweet mercy Passover us
So the years went by and the people they whined and they wandered
And only sacrifice atoned for the sins of the land
So you see the priest he placed upon the holy altar
The body of a spotless lamb
But your people are home
Twelve tribes and no crown
We want a king on a throne
You were foolish and strong
So you didn't last long
Shepherd from Bethlehem
Set the temple of God
He was a king on a throne
The kingdom is broken now
Have been scattered abroad
Can you tell of the One
This king who's going to come
Will he be a king on a throne
The hearts of the people are his
He'll take up our sickness
He'll be crushed for our evils
Our toil is neither mud nor brick nor sand
And gather us beneath your wings tonight
Our sins they are more numerous than all the lambs we slay
Our shackles they were made with our own hands
Our toil is our atonement and our freedom yours to give
And gather us beneath your wings tonight
And gather us beneath your wings tonight
How often I have longed
Who was father of a good boy named Josiah
Who caused the Babylonian captivity
Because he was a liar
I don't want to sing this twice
Jacob was the father of Joseph
So everyone packed up and headed back to their home towns
And this couple up from Galilee to Bethlehem was bound
Back when her pregnancy began to show he planned to go away
But it came to pass that in a dream an angel of the Lord
The little baby in her womb it is the Holy Spirit's work
You may have read the prophet said a virgin would give birth
So it came to pass that Joseph was the noblest of men
With a woman on a donkey on their way to Bethlehem
And I wonder whether either was aware enough that day
To know the child would bring a Kingdom
And the old would come to pass away
It was not a silent night
There was blood on the ground
You could hear a woman cry
In the alleyways that night
On the streets of David's town
And the stable was not clean
And the cobblestones were cold
And little Mary full of grace
With the tears upon her face
Had no mother's hand to hold
It was a labor of pain
It was a cold sky above
But for the girl on the ground in the dark
With every beat of her beautiful heart
It was a labor of love
Noble Joseph by her side
Callused hands and weary eyes
There were no midwives to be found
On the streets of David's town
In the middle of the night
So he held her and he prayed
Shafts of moonlight on his face
But the baby in her womb
He was the maker of the moon
He was the Author of the faith
That could make the mountains move
For little Mary full of grace
With the tears upon her face
While shepherds watched their flocks by night
All seated on the ground
The angel of the Lord came down
And glory shone around
Had seized their troubled minds
To you and all mankind
To you in David's house this day
Is born of David's line
The Savior who is Christ the Lord
The heavenly babe you there shall find
To human view displayed
All meanly wrapped in swaddling bands
And to the earth be peace
Good will henceforth from God to man
Who takes away our sin
Behold the Lamb of God
The life and light of men
Behold the Lamb of God
Who died and rose again
Behold the Lamb of God who comes
Behold the sin of man
And the theme of my song
And remember now His mercy
And sing out with joy
For the brave little boy is our Savior
By an infant born of glory
How creation held its breath
How it let out a sigh
And it filled up the sky with the angels
So sing out with joy for the brave little boy
He gave up His pride and He came here to die
Therefore God exalted Him
To the place of highest praises
And He gave Him a name above every name
Every knee would bow in worship
You don't want me to have to tell you this ten times over
So the plagues they came upon Egypt one by one
His heart was hard and the other nine just couldn't move it
He said their firstborn sons would live to see another day
That night all of the children of Israel prayed
Don't let your sweet mercy Passover us
So the years went by and the people they whined and they wandered
And only sacrifice atoned for the sins of the land
So you see the priest he placed upon the holy altar
The body of a spotless lamb
But your people are home
Twelve tribes and no crown
We want a king on a throne
You were foolish and strong
So you didn't last long
Shepherd from Bethlehem
Set the temple of God
He was a king on a throne
The kingdom is broken now
Have been scattered abroad
Can you tell of the One
This king who's going to come
Will he be a king on a throne
The hearts of the people are his
He'll take up our sickness
He'll be crushed for our evils
Our toil is neither mud nor brick nor sand
And gather us beneath your wings tonight
Our sins they are more numerous than all the lambs we slay
Our shackles they were made with our own hands
Our toil is our atonement and our freedom yours to give
And gather us beneath your wings tonight
And gather us beneath your wings tonight

For the brave little boy is our Savior
You were called to a land
And didn't know the way
We are children of the
And I long to find it
That the sun that's shining
Is a shadow of the truth
In the dark of the night
I can feel the shadows all around me
Cold shadows in the corners of my heart
But the heart of the fight
Is not in the flesh but in the spirit
And the spirit's got me shaking in the dark
And I long to go there
I can hear the promise
Of the angels of the moon
I can see in the strip malls and the phone calls
The flaming swords of Eden
In the fast cash and the news flash
And the horn blast of war
To the high and lonely mountain in the groaning wilderness
We ache for what is lost
As we wait for the holy God
I was made to go there
Out of this far country
I suppose you could lay me down to die in Illinois
Bury me beneath the rows of corn
Where in the Land of Lincoln I was born
We rode the combines in the fall
And there comes a time
For gathering the harvest after all
So when you lay me down to die
Lay me down and let me say goodbye to this world
You can lay me anywhere
But just remember this
When you lay me down to die
You lay me down to live
Well I asked a girl to marry me on a dock out on the lake
Our babies came to life in Tennessee
And the music of the mountains is still keeping me awake
We are more than flesh and bone
What is seen will pass away
What is not is going home
When you lay me down to die
Lay me down and let me say goodbye to this world
You can lay me anywhere
But just remember this
When you lay me down to die
I'll open up my eyes on the skies I've never known
In the place where I belong
And I'll realize His love is just another word for Home
I believe in the holy shores of uncreated light
I believe there is power in the blood
If you set it next to life
I believe it would barely fill a cup
When you lay me down to die
Lay me down and let me say goodbye to this world
You can lay me anywhere
But just remember this
When you lay me down to die
I met the queen of Iowa
She was dying on a couch in the suburbs
And with all of the things she was dying of
She was more alive than the others
She was pretty as a flower in a crystal vase
It lights up the room as it withers away
And she opened her eyes
When she heard the music play
We sang a hymn to the rhythm of the river that flows
Down from the mountain of the Holy Ghost
Of those who know His name
Like the Queen of Iowa
She was the Queen of Iowa
Her majesty was all ablaze
She was burning hot but not consumed
Our shoes removed in that holy place
In the hallowed ground of the living room
I bowed down low and I kissed her hand
And we raised a toast to the Promised Land
And I saw the tears of joy
We sang a hymn to the rhythm of the river that flows
Down from the mountain of the Holy Ghost
Of those who know His name
Like the Queen of Iowa
She was the Queen of Iowa
I could see my illusions scatter
Every time she drew a breath
The heart is a matter of life and death
I'll never be the same
We sang about oceans of love again
As she stared past the ceiling and the sky above
We were singing for the Queen of Iowa
We sang a hymn to the rhythm of the river that flows
Down from the mountain of the Holy Ghost
Of those who know His name
There was peace like a river in a valley of bones
It fills the valley up and it carries them home
In the river of Grace
Like the Queen of Iowa
She was the Queen of Iowa
Open the door and run outside
Your little boy heart alive
Into the morning light
Into the deep and wide
Dinosaur bones in the flowerbed
Rockets in the clouds
In a fight with a spider's web
Tunnels in the ground
To the mist of the distant shore
Back through the planet core
Feel the beat of a distant thunder
It's the sound of an ancient song
This is the Kingdom calling
Come now and tread the dawn
Come to the deeper well
And come to live a tale to tell
Pages are turning now
This is abundant life
The joy in the journey
Is enough to make a grown man cry
With a little boy heart alive
Kings and castles in the neighborhood
Swords on the forest floor
Dragons in the magic wood
Better saddle your battle horse
Better choose your weapons right
Five little stones and a faith on fire
In a little boy heart alive
Met a kid at the railroad track
He had a stick and a nylon sack
I ran to the house to pack
Take a ride on the mighty lion
Take a hold of the golden mane
This is the love of Jesus
So good but it is not tame
Ever the road goes on and on
There is no road to bear me from my sorrow
No healing that is deeper than this hurt
My heart is gone away across the water
Caught up on the wind and blown away
And bid goodbye to all my friends
And even though you know your heart is breaking
For a little longer still you must be whole
To love the life that's given for the taking
And let it lead you to those shores
Caught up on the wind and blown away
And bid goodbye to all your friends
Caught up on the wind and blown away
You'll bid goodbye to all your friends
I know you will open them again in the endless day
So follow the road through the rain
Down from the door where it began
Follow it on and on and on
Keep to the road through the rain
Follow it on and on and on
Follow it on and on and on
Follow it on and on and on and on
I am the scattered seed that fell along the path
I am the son who ran away
I am the bitter son who stayed
Why hast thou accepted me
You took my sin and wrapped me in
Your robe and your ring
Why hast thou accepted me
It's a mystery of mercy
I am the angry men who came to stone the lover
I am the woman there ashamed before the crowd
I am the leper who gave thanks
I am the nine who never came
Why hast thou accepted me
You took my sin and wrapped me in
Your robe and your ring
Why hast thou accepted me
It's a mystery of mercy
You are the bringer of the moon and all the seasons
You are the singer of the tune that calls the stars
Why hast thou accepted me
You took my sin and wrapped me in
Your robe and your ring
Why hast thou accepted me
When all my love was vinegar
Why hast thou accepted me
It's a mystery of mercy
My uncle's in the county jail
His time is on his hands
He knows he chose a barren cell
Over a fair and fertile land
He flew until he fell
Just like he has a thousand times
Nothing ever seems to change
But miles away beneath the waves
Mountains on the ocean floor
They're rising from the deep
I can't believe I landed there
I swear I swore it off
I know that I can't stand it here
Still I came and took a fall
I wish that I could shake it
I wish that I was free
I wish that I was half the man
I wish that I could be
Mountains on the ocean floor
They're moving up so slow
Nothing ever seems to change
But miles away beneath the waves
In the belly of the earth
He has given you a Name
Mountains on the ocean floor
They're rising from the deep
Where no one ever sees
They're hidden there beneath the waves
They're moving up so slow
There's a molten heart of stone
That is waiting to explode
We touched down on the sound
At the top of the world
In the land of the midnight sun
Where the frozen river melts away
And breaks into a run
That waited just to see it
From a long way off that river thawed
And the tide ran out to meet it
Break the chains of the gates of Hell
Still all manner of things will be well
See the quiet hearts of the children of
The children of this land
By the fires that warm their hands
There is a wilderness inside them
It is dark and thick and deep
And beside the fire at the heart of that wood
Is a precious missing sheep
Break the chains of the gates of Hell
Still all manner of things will be well
The Word of God will never fail
And all manner of things will be well
There's a light in the darkness
There's an end to the night
I saw the sun go down on a frozen ocean
As the man in the moon was rising
And he rode the night all full and bright
With his face at the far horizon
You think you'll never get up again
Yesterday we drove all night to Pittsburgh
Jamie laid her head down in the back
My little boys asleep beside their sister
They're the best I have
I brought an old recording of your father
He was teaching men and women how to love
He carried on about his sons and daughters
As we drove across Ohio
At the dawning of the day
I could hear the tune of truth was in his voice
And it felt just like I knew him
Though I never saw his face
Maybe that's because I know his boys
The groom who gave his life
I know you thought you'd never find a woman
I never thought I'd have to write this song
But here I am and there you are together
You felt like you were buried
In a city underground
All broken bits and pieces of the past
And somewhere she was searching
On the surface of the mound
She was digging for a treasure that would last
Now she's giving you her heart
The groom who gave his life
It is bending down to wash another's feet
It is faithful when the sun is in the west
It can hurt you as it holds you
In its overwhelming flood
And give her your heart
The groom who gave his life
This is not the end here at this grave
This is just a hole that someone made
Every hole was made to fill
Our nature hates a vacuum
This is not the hardest part of all
This is just the seed that has to fall
All our lives we till the ground
Until we lay our sorrows down
And watch the sky for rain
More than all this pain
More than all the falling down
And the getting up again
From our tiny vantage point
In this vast eternity
A thing resounds when it rings true
Ringing all the bells inside of you
Like a golden sky on a summer eve
Your heart is tugging at your sleeve
And you cannot say why
More than we can stand
Standing in the glory
Of a love that never ends
More than we can guess
And not a second less
There is more than what the naked eye can see
Clothing all our days with mystery
Watching over everything
Wilder than our wildest dreams
Could ever dream to be
Little Elba how's the sun in South America
Do they see in it the brilliance of the place that's been prepared
And dwell upon the hope of what's in store
Or are they just like me do they only see
An opportunity to complain about the heat
And little Elba how's the rain in South America
Does it fall upon the roof tops of the sick
Do they thank the Lord for coming up with such a great idea
And dream about a place beyond all this
Or are they just like us do they gripe and fuss
Of the nothing that you have
You're unfettered by the wealth of
Of a world that we pretend that's going to last
Well I'm weary of the spoils of my ambition
And I'm shackled by the comfort of my couch
Well I wish I had the courage to deny these of my self
And start to store my treasure in the clouds
Cause this is not my home
I do not belong where the antelope and the buffalo roam
And I'm just a little jealous
Of the nothing that you have
You're unfettered by the wealth of
Of a world that we pretend that's going to last
They say God's blessed us with plenty
I say you're blessed with poverty
Cause you never stop to wonder
Whether earth is just a little better than the land of the free
So I hope you're safe and dry in South America
But may you never be so happy that you forget about your home
Open the door and run outside
Your little boy heart alive
Into the morning light
Into the deep and wide
Dinosaur bones in the flowerbed
Rockets in the clouds
In a fight with a spider's web
Tunnels in the ground
To the mist of the distant shore
Back through the planet core
Feel the beat of a distant thunder
It's the sound of an ancient song
This is the Kingdom calling
Come now and tread the dawn
Come to the deeper well
And come to live a tale to tell
Pages are turning now
This is abundant life
The joy in the journey
Is enough to make a grown man cry
With a little boy heart alive
Kings and castles in the neighborhood
Swords on the forest floor
Dragons in the magic wood
Better saddle your battle horse
Better choose your weapons right
Five little stones and a faith on fire
In a little boy heart alive
Met a kid at the railroad track
He had a stick and a nylon sack
I ran to the house to pack
Take a ride on the mighty lion
Take a hold of the golden mane
This is the love of Jesus
So good but it is not tame
Ever the road goes on and on
Your flesh and blood to set me free.
And the wine it is the blood that binds us now
And the living bread remains the Communion of the Saints
And the wine it is the blood that binds us now
And the living bread remains the Communion of the Saints
God help us all if ever we forget
How the author of the story
Cast off His crown of glory
For a crown of thorns
And the wine it is the blood that binds us now
And the living bread remains the Communion of the Saints
Sing the mystery of faith
And the living bread remains the Communion of the Saints
They say it's mighty pretty in Alaska
My daddy used to talk about those deep sea fish
So don't you turn me down
In the morning we would listen to the cattle calling
Lowing in the land of Okeechobee
Where it's flatter than the cardboard on the carport floor
And the cattails seem to wave just like they know me
Goes on about the salmon caught
The time he and his brother sailed to Juneau
The bag's already packed and in the truck
The town will see us go if we're in luck
The kids have married off and moved away
And the doctor says I'm healthy for an old man dying
Well enough to seize another day
Your bag's already packed and in the truck
There were days when I imagined that the clouds were mountains
Towering above the rolling ocean
Catching salmon of my own while I was mowing
Your bag's already packed and in the truck
The town will see us go if we're in luck
Tomorrow we are Canaan bound
Where westward sails the golden sun
So bid your troubled heart be still
Like the stars across the heavens flung
Like water in the desert sprung
I trembled at the voice of God
A voice of love and thunder deep
With love He means to save us all
And Love has chosen you and me
Long after we are dead and gone
A thousand years our tale be sung
How faith compelled and bore us on
How barren Sarah bore a son
Where westward sails the golden sun
Tomorrow we are Canaan Bound
There is a reason you see
That I'm thicker in the middle
I could blame it on a bad knee
I could blame it on my blue jeans
Or that my wife is such a fine chef
But I haven't told you yet
What is that white stuff on my nachos
It's too thin for melted cheese
It's too thick to be just milk
So won't somebody tell me please
What is that white stuff I'm consuming
We'll you know they'll never tell you
In the temple of the Incas
There's a fountain flowing cheese dip
And then they smuggle it to Texas
And then they trick us with the free chips
It's mind control in a salsa bowl
I'm not even sure I remember how I got here
Well give me some of that white stuff on my nachos
It's too thin for melted cheese
It's too thick to be just milk
In its sublime consistency
What is that white stuff I'm consuming
So this is sort of a love song
It's a kind of confession
As for me ya see I'm long gone
So consider this a lesson
They wanna make us into zombies
Lurch into La Hacienda
That isn't how you wanna end up
But Mexico remembers the Alamo
He's taken over with the white stuff on my nachos
It's too thin for melted cheese
It's too thick to be just milk
So won't somebody tell me please
What is that white stuff I'm consuming
What is that white stuff won't somebody please
What is that white stuff won't somebody please
What is that white stuff
I'd give you all of me to know what you were thinking
And if I had one wish I'd wish I wasn't sinking here
Well I've been face down and pushed aside.
Well you know I'd rather just turn tail and run
Than lie here in the sun and watch you pass me by
I've got a feeling that I'm something more
The reason I was born.
And on railroad ties. I've been passed around and cast aside
And thrown away and left alone to lie
I've got a feeling that I'm something more
The reason I was born.
Then the woman danced around and called her friends all over town
And so I find that all this time beneath the surface I could shine
Like all the gold a king and queen could measure
You see even a penny is a treasure
he's singing at the foot of the throne
And I swear I heard thunder at the sound of his name
But I loved him the same
And though the angels in Heaven are dancing around
To the music that I want to hear
And I'm watching and wishing and wondering why
This silence is louder the harder I try
Now there's little to do but hope that the good ones will last
And though the angels in Heaven are dancing around
To the music that I want to hear
And I'm watching and wishing and wondering why
This silence is louder the harder I try
And this night is beautiful. I see the sky about to rain
And I think I hear the wild wind howling
And I take comfort in knowing that this ain't my home
And I know that he's singing at the foot of the throne
Through the heat as thick as the blood
And I don't think much about nothing in Carolina
But it sure feels nice
And the things I left undone
Become the things I'll never do
But my feet still slip in the mud
Just a little bit of change
Through the heat as thick as the blood
And there ain't no doubt about nothing in Carolina
Not living on bread alone
Oh the depth of the riches
Of the wisdom and knowledge of God
How unsearchable his judgment
How unknowable his paths
Who knows the mind of our God
To God be the glory forever and ever
Oh the depth of the riches
Of the wisdom and knowledge of God
How unsearchable his judgment
How unknowable his paths
Who knows the mind of our God
To God be the glory forever and ever
To God be the glory forever and ever
To God be the glory forever and ever
To God be the glory forever and ever
Just a rhyme and a melody
But I promised I'd write if it took all night
They say there ain't no sleeping in heaven
So when you close your eyes
Know your mother and I
Pray the Lord your soul to keep
And we never got the chance to hold you
And we never got to tell you goodnight
So we hope you can hear as Jesus cradles you near
Are you throwing a ball against a heavenly wall
Well there's so much love between us
And so much that I wanna say
I wanna ramble awhile with my beautiful child
Lost my luggage in Kalamazoo
This is a thing that confounds me
I lose my way and I forget about You
But You still remember me
The rain that falls on the sinner and the saint.
The well that won't run dry
These mercies are made new every morning
And when I think about that prodigal son
I've got to smile when I see the old man run
And I know that You love us the same
Just as if we deserved it
Just as if every one of us fools was worth it
This rain that falls on the sinner and the saints
This well that won't run dry
These mercies are made new every morning
Isn't it love to look down from the sky
And see Your only Son on the cross asking why
And somehow let Him die that way
And not call the whole thing off
All for a man here in Kalamazoo
Who loses his bags and his way sometimes too
But that was something that You already knew
And rub your tired eyes
Go and kiss your mama
We'll be gone a little while
Come and walk beside me
Come and hold your papa's hand
I go to make an altar
And to offer up my lamb
And in a waking dream He came
Riding on a wind across the sand
And I waited in the dark
The answer was a sword
That came down hard upon my heart
And the Lord I will obey
So take me to the mountain
I will follow where You lead
There I'll lay the body
Of the boy You gave to me
And even though You take him
Still I ever will obey
And the Lord I will obey
And the Lord I will obey
I met a man on the beach out in Panama City
Who was haggard and worn like a slave
He said his life had been sweet
And that he wasn't quitting
But he knew that today was his day.
I have drunk from every fountain in this world
I have turned each mossy stone
And have found myself alone
And he rambled on beneath the misty moon
And I've kept more than I gave
It washes and it stains
Poured out from heaven's cup
For you and me to drink it up
And in stubborn spite of my stubborn spite
I am loved nonetheless
I am loved all the more
I watched him empty out his pockets and take his shirt off
And he smiled awhile at something in his mind
It washes and it stains
Poured out from heaven's cup
For you and me to drink it up
And in stubborn spite of my stubborn spite
I am loved nonetheless
I am loved all the more
He said it would not be long till he was leaving
Then I saw this boat appear before my eyes
It washes and it stains
Poured out from heaven's cup
For you and me to drink it up
And in stubborn spite of my stubborn spite
I am loved nonetheless
I am loved all the more
And I believe there is love enough for the taking
I love you today and I love you tomorrow
I love you as deep as the sea
I love you in joy and I love you in sorrow
You can always come home to me
There once was a man who found him a treasure
Buried out under a tree
He sold all he had just to own it forever
I love you today and I love you tomorrow
I love you as deep as the sea
I love you in joy and I love you in sorrow
You can always come home to me
There once were some sheep safe on the farm
And one little lamb got loose
The shepherd went out and carried it home
That little lamb is you
I love you today and I love you tomorrow
I love you as deep as the sea
I love you in joy and I love you in sorrow
I've got you swaddled and I've got your bottle
And you're too loud to ignore
Your mama is sleeping
The angels are keeping
Most beautiful girl in the whole wide world
The squirrels are all nestled down
The trees in the forest are joining the chorus
And swaying to the sound
Most beautiful girl in the whole wide world
And sweet little girls get older.
But when your tooth aches or your heart breaks
She was a fine theologian who passed for a pope
And she never ever was able to say
That she wanted no more of the bishops and the boards
What she needed was a good man for a day
So she wept in her chambers and burned like a flame
If they knew I was nothing but gold plated lead
And was a good looking devil to boot
So when he showed up that evening for the annual meeting
With the pope that he thought that he knew
Understandably stunned that the pope was a nun
The bishop initially started to run
But their meetings were frequent and secretly done
And she told him that a baby would come
If they knew I was nothing but gold plated lead
And everybody thinks that I write my own
Who wrote every song that I know
If they knew I was nothing but gold plated lead
Except about how hard they are to move.
Have you ever stood before them
Like a mustard seed that's waiting for some proof.
It's brave and bittersweet.
And hope is hard to hold to
I'll see your face and Lord I'll know That only love remains.
It's brave and bittersweet.
And hope is hard to hold to
I'll see your face and Lord I'll know
I'll sing your praise and let them go cause only love
Only Your love remains
So I will drive these roads in thunder and in rain
And I will sing your song at the top of my lungs
And I will praise you dear Lord in glory and in pain.
And I will follow you till this race is won
And I will drive these roads till this motor won't run
And I will sing your song from sea to shining sea
And I will praise you Lord till your Kingdom comes
And I will follow were You lead.
I'll see your face and Lord I'll know
I'll sing your praise and let them go...
Except about how hard they are to move.
Have you ever stood before them
Like a mustard seed that's waiting for some proof.
It's brave and bittersweet.
And hope is hard to hold to
I'll see your face and Lord I'll know That only love remains.
It's brave and bittersweet.
And hope is hard to hold to
I'll see your face and Lord I'll know
I'll sing your praise and let them go cause only love
Only Your love remains
So I will drive these roads in thunder and in rain
And I will sing your song at the top of my lungs
And I will praise you dear Lord in glory and in pain.
And I will follow you till this race is won
And I will drive these roads till this motor won't run
And I will sing your song from sea to shining sea
And I will praise you Lord till your Kingdom comes
And I will follow were You lead.
I'll see your face and Lord I'll know
I'll sing your praise and let them go...
Wind in the olive reed softly did blow
Sheep on the hillside lay whiter than snow
Then from the happy sky angels bent low
Singing their anthems of joy long ago
Stars in their circling courses did go
Telling their tidings of joy long ago
Wise men and kings gave their treasures of gold
Wind in the olive tree softly did blow
Still we remember how gentle and low
God came to dwell in us
God came to dwell in us
Came to dwell with us
Daniel hollered goodbye to the old river barge
With a dream in his head and a bride in his arms
But everyone longed to go
Six girls and a boy grew up in that Florida rain
They were carried along like leaves on a river of faith
They followed the tracks that the saints have trod
They walked in the rain of His mercy
Let it soak them down to the bone
And they splashed in its puddles
And danced in its streams as they'd go
I have slept in the house where my mother was born
And I've seen the sun set on the lake that gave birth to those storms
But I know that their house stood firm
They followed the tracks that the saints have trod
They walked in the rain of His mercy
Let it soak them down to the bone
And they splashed in its puddles
And danced in its streams as they'd go
When they sat in their home
When they walked along the road
When they slept and when they rose
The words of the Lord were impressed on their minds
And after all this time
I'm carried along like a leaf on a river of faith
I'll walk in the rain of His mercy
Let it soak me down to the bone
And I'll splash in its puddles
And dance in its streams as I go
Come broken and weary
Come battered and bruised
My Jesus makes all things new
Come lost and abandoned
Come blown by the wind
He'll bring you back home again
The light of the dawn is upon you
He makes all things new
Come frozen with shame
Come burning with guilt
The light of the dawn is upon you
He makes all things new
He makes all things new
The world will be redeemed
The world will be redeemed
So hold on to the promise
The stories are true that Jesus makes all things new
The light of the dawn is upon you
He makes all things new
The light of the dawn is upon you
He makes all things new
He makes all things new
I am tangled up in contradiction
I am strangled by my own two hands
I am hunted by the hounds of addiction
I have lied to everyone who trusts me
I have tried to fall when I could stand
I have only loved the ones who loved me
See the long awaited king
Come to set his people free
Come and tear the temple down
Raise it up on holy ground
I have struggled to remove this raiment
Tried to hide every shimmering strand
I contend with these ghosts and these hosts of bright angels
I have cursed the man that you have made me
I have nursed the beast that bays for my blood
See the long awaited king
Come to set his people free
Won't ya tear the temple down
Raise it up on holy ground
And we take your life
And we take your life
It is life that you have given
You have crushed beneath your heel the vile serpent
You have carried to the grave the black stain
You have torn apart the temple's holy curtain
You have beaten Death at Death's own game
Come to set his people free
Won't you tear this temple down
Raise it up on holy ground
I will lift my voice and sing
you have come and washed me clean
It's enough to pay the price to set you free
It can fill up every jar and every heart that ever beat
When it's all you have it's all you'll ever need
When it's all you have it's all you'll ever need
Running humble with a power you cannot see
Only go down to the Jordan and believe
Only go down in the Jordan and believe
The closer that I grow
The more I come to know how much I need it
The blood of Jesus it is like Elijah's fire
Falling on the alter of your faith
All the wisdom of the world could never conjure up a spark
But no power of Hell could ever quench this flame
No power of Hell could ever touch this flame
The closer that I grow
The more I come to know how much I need it
The closer that I grow
The more I come to know how much I need the blood of Jesus
When it's all you have it's all you'll ever need
For the the moon in the space of the dark night
For the smile on a face in the sunlight
For the sound of the storm on the window
For the morning adorned with a new snow
For the tears on the face of the old man
Made clean by the grace of the good Lamb
All the works that you have made
Are clearly seen and plain as day
That I see you everywhere
In the seed that descends to the old earth
And arises again with a new birth
In the sinner who sinks in the river
All the works that you have made
Are clearly seen and plain as day
All creation tells the tale
That Love is real and so alive
Great God Unseen I see you
And the sweet resurrection
I hear the sound of the streets of the city.
My belly growls like a hungry wolf
And I let it prowl till my belly's full.
I tell you that my love is true
Till it fades away like a morning dew.
Here I am in the Valley of Trouble.
Badlands as far as I can see.
I lay in the brick street like a stray dog.
You came to me like a silver moon
With the saddest smile I ever knew.
Hosea carried me home again.
A barren place where nothing can grow.
It was a valley as green as jade.
I swear it was the color of hope.
I am a slave and a harlot no more.
You washed me clean like a summer rain
And you set me free with that ball and chain.
It took all the freedom I wanted and gave me something else instead.
And nobody here knows better than I that it's a good thing.
Love is a good thing.
It'll wear you down till your heart just breaks
And it's a good thing.
Love is a good thing.
It'll burn you like a cinder till you're tender to the touch.
Love is a good thing.
Open the wounds that you tried to hide.
And there in the rubble of the heart that died
You'll find a good thing.
Cause love is a good thing.
Oh love is a good thing.
Loose all the chains of the ties that bind.
Love is a good thing.
It can hurt like a blast from a hand grenade
When all that used to matter is blown away.
There in the middle of the mess it made you'll find a good thing.
The road is long that leads me home tonight.
I don't always love you the best that I can.
I won't give up on you.
Got all these letters that I never did write.
All this affection I kept inside my heart.
I won't give up on you.
You were there when I shook my fist at the sky.
You were there when I fell to the earth and cried.
And the storm inside was raging.
And his love was teaching us a language we thought was lost.
Been burned by the holy fire of love.
Made clean by the holy fire of love.
Deep as an ocean and hot as a thousand suns.
All covered in light.
The iron shine of a golden dream.
A potential explosion
Stands so tall and so serene.
I've got two little boys and a girl in bows.
To count down the seconds
Into the arms of the astral glow.
We're gonna see a rocket blast
In a bliss of mystical motion
Just look at the ground on the grassy hill.
And they say the ground is gonna
Gonna shake my bones.
Into the grace of the great unknown.
We're gonna see a rocket blast
In a bliss of mystical motion
We saw the rocket rise in a fiery hue.
It defied destruction to ride the eruption.
Love alone can carry you
In a bliss of mystical motion.
Love alone can carry you.
We're gonna see a rocket rise.
So you're sitting at the movies.
You're watching how the story finds a way.
Still you love to see the hero save the day.
A little glimpse of all the
Goodness getting through.
And all along the way the days
Are made of little moments of truth.
Oh and every Sunday morning
You can see the people standing in a line.
For a taste of the Communion bread and wine.
A little glimpse of all the
Goodness getting through.
And all along the way the days
Are made of little moments of truth.
It's the way the clouds are burning
From the angle of the light
And you're watching at your window
At the ending of the night
It's a window in the world.
He's watching for the moment she appears.
They are laying down their lives for love
And Love is laying waste to all my fears.
A little portal where you get a better view.
And the wonder of it all
Is all you need to see the goodness getting through.
And all along the way the days
All along the way the road
So you say there is no hope. Maybe God is dead and gone.
I tell you I've got news for you.
I heard the call and came
I walked the aisle and I took his hand
I mostly dove right in
From the shallow well
Then I rocked and rolled with a lousy band
Till I heard a song that took my hand
Son of the living God
Son of the living God
All I know is that I was blind
That though I kick and scream
And every step of the way
His grace is making me
With every breath I breathe
So when my body's weak and the day is long
When I feel my faith is all but gone
I'll remember when I sing this song
Son of the living God
Son of the living God
Son of the living God
Son of the living God
Son of the living God
I heard the call and came
I walked the aisle and I took his hand
I mostly dove right in
From the shallow well
Then I rocked and rolled with a lousy band
Till I heard a song that took my hand
Son of the living God
Son of the living God
All I know is that I was blind
That though I kick and scream
And every step of the way
His grace is making me
With every breath I breathe
So when my body's weak and the day is long
When I feel my faith is all but gone
I'll remember when I sing this song
Son of the living God
Son of the living God
Son of the living God
Son of the living God
Son of the living God
You were called to a land
And didn't know the way
We are children of the
And I long to find it
That the sun that's shining
Is a shadow of the truth
In the dark of the night
I can feel the shadows all around me
Cold shadows in the corners of my heart
But the heart of the fight
Is not in the flesh but in the spirit
And the spirit's got me shaking in the dark
And I long to go there
I can hear the promise
Of the angels of the moon
I can see in the strip malls and the phone calls
The flaming swords of Eden
In the fast cash and the news flash
And the horn blast of war
To the high and lonely mountain in the groaning wilderness
We ache for what is lost
As we wait for the holy God
I was made to go there
Out of this far country
So you're sitting at the movies.
You're watching how the story finds a way.
Still you love to see the hero save the day.
A little glimpse of all the
Goodness getting through.
And all along the way the days
Are made of little moments of truth.
Oh and every Sunday morning

I tell you I've got news for you.
Come broken and weary
Come battered and bruised
My Jesus makes all things new
Come lost and abandoned
Come blown by the wind
He'll bring you back home again
The light of the dawn is upon you
He makes all things new
Come frozen with shame
Come burning with guilt
The light of the dawn is upon you
He makes all things new
He makes all things new
The world will be redeemed
The world will be redeemed
So hold on to the promise
The stories are true that Jesus makes all things new
The light of the dawn is upon you
He makes all things new
The light of the dawn is upon you
He makes all things new
He makes all things new
This is not the end here at this grave
This is just a hole that someone made
Every hole was made to fill
Our nature hates a vacuum
This is not the hardest part of all
This is just the seed that has to fall
All our lives we till the ground
Until we lay our sorrows down
And watch the sky for rain
More than all this pain
More than all the falling down
And the getting up again
From our tiny vantage point
In this vast eternity
A thing resounds when it rings true
Ringing all the bells inside of you
Like a golden sky on a summer eve
Your heart is tugging at your sleeve
And you cannot say why
More than we can stand
Standing in the glory
Of a love that never ends
More than we can guess
And not a second less
There is more than what the naked eye can see
Clothing all our days with mystery
Watching over everything
Wilder than our wildest dreams
Could ever dream to be
I fear that I will soon forget
Now I have no strength to stand and stumble
When flesh is strong and spirit weak
Please break my back if I won't bow
Won't you have your way with me
When I am bent with holy shame
All the lies that I believed have crumbled
The blood of Christ my only claim
I cannot trust my own designs
My heart is prone to disobey
Chain me fast if I won't stay
Take my life and have your way
When sin has loosed its hold on me
Thy mercy is a mighty tower
I am tangled up in contradiction
I am strangled by my own two hands
I am hunted by the hounds of addiction
I have lied to everyone who trusts me
I have tried to fall when I could stand
I have only loved the ones who loved me
See the long awaited king
Come to set his people free
Come and tear the temple down
Raise it up on holy ground
I have struggled to remove this raiment
Tried to hide every shimmering strand
I contend with these ghosts and these hosts of bright angels
I have cursed the man that you have made me
I have nursed the beast that bays for my blood
See the long awaited king
Come to set his people free
Won't ya tear the temple down
Raise it up on holy ground
And we take your life
And we take your life
It is life that you have given
You have crushed beneath your heel the vile serpent
You have carried to the grave the black stain
You have torn apart the temple's holy curtain
You have beaten Death at Death's own game
Come to set his people free
Won't you tear this temple down
Raise it up on holy ground
I will lift my voice and sing
you have come and washed me clean
If you'll step inside this great glass elevator
It'll take us up above the city lights
To where the planet curves away to the equator
I want to show you something fine
You can see the roads that we all traveled just to get here
A million minuscule decisions in a line
Why they brought us to this moment isn't clear
Could it be that the many roads
Were just for me to tell this story
And for you to hear this song
Were meant to bring you here all along
So if you'll trust me with your time I'll spend it wisely
I will sing to you with all I have to give
We've got Benjamin to play the grand piano
If we're lucky it's a little out of tune
How I love to watch you listen to the music
Could it be that the many roads
Were just for you to tell that story
And for me to hear that song
Were meant to bring me here all along
The year we got engaged
And everyone said we were much too young
We got the rings for forty each
From a pawn shop down the road
We said our vows and took the leap
Now fifteen years ago
And we went dancing in the minefields
We went sailing in the storms
And it was harder than we dreamed
But I believe that's what the promise is for
The beginning of the end
Is a good place to begin
Is to lay your own life down
And I believe it's an easy price
For the life that we have found
And we're dancing in the minefields
We're sailing in the storms
This is harder than we dreamed
But I believe that's what the promise is for
That's what the promise is for
So there's nothing left to fear
Till the shadows disappear
And his promises are true
So in the face of all this chaos
So let's go dancing in the minefields
Let's go sailing in the storms
And kicking down the doors
And sailing in the storms
But I believe that's what the promise is for
We laid the maples in the ground to have and hold
As Autumn falls to Winters sleep
We pray that somehow in the Spring
And many years from now
Long after we are gone
These trees will spread their branches out
He took a plane to Africa
He gathered up into his arms
So many years from now
Long after we are gone
This tree will spread its branches out
So sit down and write that letter
Sign up and join the fight
Sink in to all that matters
Step out into the light
Let go of all that's passing
Lift up the least of these
Lean into something lasting
She rises up as morning breaks
She moves among these rooms alone
She waters us with love and the children grow
So many years from now
Long after we are gone
These trees will spread their branches out
These trees will spread their branches out
Come climb the hill with me
Come and be still with me
Come watch the sun sink away
Come watch the garden grow
Down by the gravel road
Come warm your hands in the gold
Speak in the peace of this place
Come walk the cedar stand
Sit on the bench at the bend in the trail again
Look how the children laugh
Out in the tumble grass
Bright as a fire and as fine as a photograph
Here at the magic hour
Mingle a moment in chorus
Here at the magic hour
Bright is the mystery
Plain is the beauty before us
What is this voice that sings
I grew up in a little town
A southern mix of lost and found
Where most folks seem to stick around
But I could hear the highway song
I'd sit out on the dock till dawn
And dream about the great beyond
Set me loose to find my way
Just get me out on the road someday
With my sails unfurled
If I could travel the world
Soon enough I had my way
I saw the world the Lord has made
Mostly from the interstate
But I had hardly seen a thing
Until I gave a golden ring
To the one who gave her heart to me
That's the day I hit the road
She opened the gate and took my hand
And led me into the mystic land
Where her galaxies swirl
I want to travel the world
Take a left at the end of my street
Just a few doors down
Up the hill and into the trees
There's a hole in the ground
Where we traveled the caverns so deep
We wandered the wonders so wide
It was right beneath our feet
Tonight I saw the children in their rooms
Little flowers all in bloom
Burning suns and silver moon
And somehow in that starry sky
The image of the Maker lies
Right here beneath my roof tonight
Pack yours bags and dig down deep
Let's ride the storms and sail the seas
Into these uncharted lands
To blaze a trail in the vast expanse
Of the heart and soul
In the grace of the God of peace
Let's wade into the battle
And get up in that saddle
There's a million mysteries
Somewhere along the Scottish coast
And emerald island lies
And I will steer my sailing boat
Unto the Isle of Skye
The weather's always changing
From heavy cloud to fair
And even when it's raining
Huddled in the harbor
Every man an ocean from his home
Their captors could not keep them
When they heard the drums of freedom
The dream of a kingdom
In a land they've never known
And God of my fathers
Strangers in this country
Pilgrims on these dusty roads
Across the great plains
In the bellies of the steel trains
In that wilderness of hope
Like my fathers I am looking for a home
Looking for a home beyond the sea
So be my God and guide me
Till I lie beneath the hills
Then let the great God of my fathers
Be the great God of my children still
God of my grandfathers
Gone these many years now
I guess they're shining like the sun
Grinning at the finish
Now we're counting stars and counting sand
Little feet and little hands
We pray you'll know them
As you knew us when you wove us
Looking for a home beyond the sea
So be their God and guide them
Till they lie beneath these hills
And let the great God of their father
Let the great God of my fathers
It's so easy to cash in these chips on my shoulders
So easy to lose this old tongue like a tiger
It's easy to let all this bitterness smolder
Just to hide it away like a cigarette lighter
It's easy to curse and to hurt and to hinder
It's easy to not have the heart to remember
That I am a priest and a prince in the Kingdom of God
I've got voices that scream in my head like a siren
Fears that I feel in the night when I sleep
Stupid choices I made when I played in the mire
Like a kid in the mud on some dirty blind street
I've got blood on these hands that hold on to the truth
That I am a priest and a prince in the Kingdom of God
I swore on the Bible not to tell a lie
But I've lied and lied
And I crossed my heart and I hoped to die
And I've died and died
But if it's true that you gathered my sin in your hand
And you cast it as far as the east is from the west
If it's true that you put on the flesh of a man
And you walked in my shoes through the shadow of death
If it's true that you dwell in the halls of my heart
Then I'm not just a fool with a fancy guitar
I am weary with the pain of Jacob's wrestling
But he met the morning wounded with a blessing
And when Elisha woke surrounded by the forces
He saw the hills aflame with angels on their horses
I see the slave that toils beneath the yoke unyielding
For some hand to stay the whip his foe is wielding
I see the armies of the enemy approaching
But a doorway through the waters now is opening
Like the son who thought he'd gone beyond forgiveness
He would see his father running from a distance
And I can see the crowd of men retreating
As He stands between the woman and their stones
And if mercy in His holy heart is beating
Well I remember how they scorned the son of Mary
But the rulers of this earth could not control Him
And all the chains of death could never hope to hold Him
And I can see the Son of Man descending
And the sword He swings is brighter than the dawn
And the gates of hell will never stand against Him
You could no more kill the darkness
Than you could raise the sun
And the sky was cold and black
Like the barrel of a gun
And I remember the tremble
In the words you spoke
As you balanced there on the brink
At the end of your rope
You came so close to letting go
And you knew she would hate you
She would kick you out
You'd been lying in the bed that you made
When you broke your vow
Then you work in the wasteland
Of the truth you told
She was bright as a band of gold
You came so close to letting go
And the sky in Nashville
Without a trace of snow
But there is no shadow
The closer the heavens are
They don't sing the way they did before
They're just piles of stone
Like corpses on a field of war
And they just don't make me cry no more
And the highway's like an old sad song
People moving through their lives alone
On the run from grace
Like fugitives without a home
And the highway's like an old sad song
And my heart is black as coal
It's been mined and there ain't no gold
It's so dark in there
I will lay down in the this empty hole
Where my heart is black as coal
I have fallen past the last frontier
But at the bottom of this well I hear you breathing
Love has found me here
I can see the storm descending on the hill tonight
Tall trees are bending to your will tonight
Let the mighty bow down
At the thundering sound of your voice
I can hear the howling wind and feel the rain tonight
Every drop a prophet in your name tonight
And the words that they sing
And I know you hear the cries of every soul tonight
You see the teardrops as they roll tonight
Down the faces of saints
Who grow weary and faint in your fields
And the wicked roam the cities and the streets tonight
But when the God of love and thunder speaks tonight
Down the faces of saints
Who grow weary and faint in your fields
And the wicked roam the cities and the streets tonight
But when the God of love and thunder speaks tonight
I believe You will come
You are holiness and grace
You are fury and rest
You are anger and love
You curse and you bless
You are mighty and weak
You are silence and song
And I am standing in the stillness of the reckoning
The storm is past and rest is beckoning
And I know that I don't know what I'm asking
But I long to look you full in the face
We were sitting in our rooms with our headphones on
We were reading through jackets in the back of the car
We were picking out notes and learning the parts
To different radios we were singing along
In different towns we had our roots
From Chesapeake to Baton Rouge
Yeah but when the piper played his tune
We all left the homes we knew
And followed the same song
And one by one we landed here
And found that we were not alone
We could sit around for hours just talking about
How we all wore that record out
How the change that it made was so profound
We're still trying to find that sound
Even now it's the same song
And one by one we landed here
And found that we were not alone
It's the one that makes it easy to believe
It's the one about the ache and I'm longing for home
It's the one about you and me
We got valleys yet to cross
Yeah but we can make it holding on
To the common threat that binds us all
Oh it's the same song
We're singing the same song
I remember the day of the Tennessee flood
The sound of the scream and the sight of the blood
My son he saw as the animal died
In the jaws of the dog as the river ran by
It was there on the page of the book that I read
The boy grew up and the yearling was dead
He stood at the gate with the angel on guard
And wept to the death of his little boy heart
We wake in the night in the womb of the world
We beat our fists on the door
We cannot breathe in the sea that swirls
So we groan in this great darkness
So I sit on the bench at the bend in the trail
And I can feel in the fall the final exhale
The trees of the field all wring their hands
And the leaves go by like a funeral band
We wake in the night in the womb of the world
We beat our fists on the door
We cannot breathe in this sea that swirls
So we groan in this great darkness
If nature's red in tooth and in claw
Seems to me that she's an outlaw
At the end of the book of a beating heart
And the answer's scrawled on the silent dark
In the dome of the sky in a billion stars
But we cannot read these angel tongues
We cannot stare at the burning sun
And we cannot breathe with these broken lungs
So we kick in the womb and we beg to be born
I saw the desert wind
Tear across the wilderness
I felt it blowing off the page
And I have always been afraid
I read about the God of Moses
Roaring in the holy cloud
It shook my bedroom window panes
I did not understand then
I do not understand now
I don't expect you to explain
You've been a mystery since the moment that I met you
You never move but I can never seem to catch you
You said to eat your flesh
Before you broke the bread and blessed it
Before you poured the wine for every man
You turned the tables over
There in your father's temple
You cracked a whip and raised a shout
My daughter asked me why
I saw you there but it was too late to change my course
And I collided with a beautiful immovable force
And so the stone that I rejected
It has become the cornerstone
And so the stone that I rejected
It has become the cornerstone
All the maps were drawn
But the maps were wrong
The stars spin around
All the maps were drawn
But the maps were wrong
The rivers are running from
You looked me in the eye and fixed me with a permanent stare
I met your gaze and saw the forges of the firmament there
And the floods come up
And the rains come down
And the floods come up
And the rains come down
And the floods come up
I will always be with you
You don't have to work so hard
You don't have to prove yourself
You don't have to hide your heart
Can come between us now
You don't have to work so hard
You don't have to prove yourself
You don't have to hide your heart
You work so hard to wear yourself down
And you're running like a rodeo clown
You're smiling like you're scared to death
You're out of faith and all out of breath
You're so afraid you've got nowhere left to go
I will always be with you
You don't have to work so hard
You don't have to prove yourself
You don't have to hide your heart
I know you've been afraid
Don't know what to do
You've been lost in the questions
I don't know what to say
I'm sure if I were you
I'd proceed with some caution
But I want you to know
When the joy that you feel
Leaves a terrible ache in your bones
It's the voice of Jesus
Calling you back home
I know you've got a lot
Spinning in your head
All this emptiness fills you
To ask the silence to still you
And you might hear a beat
On the door of your heart
It's the voice of Jesus
Calling you his bride
Once upon a time there was a little boy
And he heard in the leaves
And behind every tree
The sound of a secret companion
Somewhere there's a king
Who will love you forever
And nothing in the world
Could ever come between
So when I kiss you at night
And I turn out the light
And I tell you you're never alone
It's the voice of Jesus
It's the voice of Jesus
When the whippoorwill sings
How you stole across the pasture
Where you laid down by the water
On a bed of Spanish moss
When wind was on the prairie
And the fire was in the stove
With the wood you had to carry
From the corner of the grove
And your daddy let you disappear
With all your fishing gear
And there's a little boy
Who's lost out in the woods
Always looking for the fawn
When I hid out in the corn
How the clouds were moving faster
With the coming of the storm
And I knew that I had broken
Something I could not repair
Because the field was green as eden
Then it withered into brown
In the middle of my grieving
They came and cut it down
And I was sure that it was all my fault
The day they mowed the garden
And there's a little boy
Who's lost out in the woods
Always looking for the fawn
Is there any way that we can
Now you're broken by the years
As you lie down in the aster
And listen for the deer
And I'm a million miles away
But I still pray the fawn can find me
And listened to the children run
Just beyond the garden gate
There was a sign that said we weren't allowed
To duck inside and join the crowd
Without a son or daughter's hand
But it's so good to be young
And I don't want to go back
I just want to go on and on and on
And everybody's so surprised
When right before your very eyes
Your baby's in the second grade
You blink and it's her wedding day
And we just can't get used to being here
Where the ticking clock is loud and clear
On the run from entropy
But it's so good to be young
And I don't want to go back
I just want to go on and on and on
Though your body's wasting away
Who didn't feel the curse's toll
Who didn't wish that death would die
Maybe that's the reason why
But it's so good to be young
And I don't want to go back
I just want to go on and on and on
Though your body's wasting away
Your body will rise and never decay
I remember once I broke down in the country
I was sixteen with a broken heart in bloom
And I walked home through the pines
Nobody saw me but the moon
By sunrise I could hear the church bells ringing
I got there as the saints were marching in
I sat down on the back row
And heard the story once again
And the servants of the secret fire
The embers of the ages
And all at once I saw the shadows flee
Be a light unto my path
And a lamp unto my feet
So sick I couldn't speak
And the fever wouldn't break
But when I stepped up to the microphone I heard it
It was the voices of the brothers at my side
They were singing out my song
When the song in me had died
Somebody come and get me when I'm gone
Two years ago I drove into a darkness
I straightened every curve on cane ridge road
And I could hear the flapping wings
Of every devil I have known
And the inside of my car was like a casket
But then it flooded with a blaze of sacred light
She was calling me back home
And as I pulled into the drive
I knew the servants of the secret fire
The embers of the ages
She was standing on the porch where I could see
Be a light unto my path
Though the powers rise against us
Though your fears assail you
And your body may fail you
There's a fire that burns within us
And we dream in the night
With the sun in the center
Carry the fire for you
Carry the fire for you
And we kneel in the water
The sons and the daughters
And we hold our hearts before us
And we look to the distance
And raise our resistance
In the face of the forces
And we dream in the night
Of a king and a kingdom
Where joy writes the songs
And the innocent sing them
Carry the fire for you
When your hope is gone
And we dream in the night
Of a feast and a wedding
And the groom in his glory
When the bride is made ready
Carry the fire for you
Carry the fire for you
When your hope is gone
Sing on and on and on
I can see the road that lies ahead
I can see the love and the sorrow
Dark nights awake in a stormy bed
So keep to the old roads
Keep to the old roads
And you'll find your way
The first time you know you're not enough
The first time there's no one there to hold you
The first time you pack it all up
And drive alone across America
Please remember the words that I told you
Keep to the old roads
Keep to the old roads
And you'll find your way
If love is what you're looking for
The old roads lead to an open door
And you'll find your way
And I know you'll be scared when you take up that cross
And I love you so much and it's so hard to watch
But you're gonna grow up and you're gonna get lost
Lash your heart to the ancient mast
To the hope that's taken hold of you
And you'll find your way
If love is what you're looking for
The old roads lead to an open door
And you'll find your way
Can't you feel it in your bones
Something isn't right here
Something that you've always known
But you don't know why
We face another night here
Waiting for the world to spin around
But when you see the morning sun
Burning through a silver mist
Don't you ever wonder why
In spite of all that's wrong here
There's still so much that goes so right
The air is full of song here
The thunder rolls and the baby sighs
And the rain comes down
And when you see the spring has come
And it warms you like a mother's kiss
I used to be a little boy
As golden as a sunrise
Breaking over Illinois
When the corn was tall
And he's haunted by the heart that died
Longing for the world that was
A grace that I cannot resist
And I just want to thank someone
I just want to thank someone for this
Now I can see the world is charged
It's glimmering with promises
Written in a script of stars
I am hounded by a restlessness
Eaten by this endless ache
But still I will give thanks for this
I can feel it when the horses run
It's howling in the snowy peaks
It's blazing in the midnight sun
Just behind a veil of wind
A million angels waiting in the wings
A swirling storm of cherubim
Making ready for the reckoning
And when the world is new again
And the children of the king
Are ancient in their youth again
Maybe it's a better thing
To be more than merely innocent
But to be broken then redeemed by love
Maybe this old world is bent
He's crying in the wilderness
After all these years I would have thought
But I still get scared.
And I thought that all my struggles would be
Victories by now but I confess
That the mess is there.
Is coming to an end someday.
You led me by the hand into a land of green and gold.
You never let go. You never let go.
Your love endures forever wherever I go.
After all these years that's all that I know. Oh.
From Illinois to Shiloh to The Warren
Well I've been longing for a land.
But not everyone who wanders is lost
Is in the palm of your hand.
Where I'm gonna be with you someday.
You led me by the hand into a land of green and gold.
You never let go. You never let go.
Your love endures forever wherever I go
After all these years.
You led me by the hand into a land of green and gold.
I'm gonna go home to the arms of a Father who never let me go.
After all these years that's all that I know. Oh.
You never let go. Oh.
I can see the storm descending on the hill tonight
Tall trees are bending to your will tonight
Let the mighty bow down
At the thundering sound of your voice
I can hear the howling wind and feel the rain tonight
Every drop a prophet in your name tonight
And the words that they sing
And I know you hear the cries of every soul tonight
You see the teardrops as they roll tonight
Down the faces of saints
Who grow weary and faint in your fields
And the wicked roam the cities and the streets tonight
But when the God of love and thunder speaks tonight
Down the faces of saints
Who grow weary and faint in your fields
And the wicked roam the cities and the streets tonight
But when the God of love and thunder speaks tonight
I believe You will come
You are holiness and grace
You are fury and rest
You are anger and love
You curse and you bless
You are mighty and weak
You are silence and song
And I am standing in the stillness of the reckoning
The storm is past and rest is beckoning
And I know that I don't know what I'm asking
But I long to look you full in the face
After the last tear falls
After the last bullet tears through flesh and bone
After the last child starves
And the last girl walks the boulevard
After the last year that's just too hard
After the last disgrace
After the last lie to save some face
After the last brutal jab from a poison tongue
After the last dirty politician
After the last meal down at the mission
After the last lonely night in prison
Of love and love again
We'll see how the tears that have fallen
Were caught in the palms
Of the Giver of love and the Lover of all
And we'll look back on these tears as old tales
After the last siren wails
After the last young husband sails off to join the war
After the last young girl's innocence is stolen
After the last years of silence that won't let a heart open
Of love and love again
We'll see how the tears that have fallen
Were caught in the palms
Of the Giver of love and the Lover of all
And we'll look back on these tears as old tales
Come broken and weary
Come battered and bruised
My Jesus makes all things new
Come lost and abandoned
Come blown by the wind
He'll bring you back home again
The light of the dawn is upon you
He makes all things new
Come frozen with shame
Come burning with guilt
The light of the dawn is upon you
He makes all things new
He makes all things new
The world will be redeemed
The world will be redeemed
So hold on to the promise
The stories are true that Jesus makes all things new
The light of the dawn is upon you
He makes all things new
The light of the dawn is upon you
He makes all things new
He makes all things new
Can't you feel it in your bones
Something isn't right here
Something that you've always known
But you don't know why
We face another night here
Waiting for the world to spin around
But when you see the morning sun
Burning through a silver mist
Don't you ever wonder why
In spite of all that's wrong here
There's still so much that goes so right
The air is full of song here
The thunder rolls and the baby sighs
And the rain comes down
And when you see the spring has come
And it warms you like a mother's kiss
I used to be a little boy
As golden as a sunrise
Breaking over Illinois
When the corn was tall
And he's haunted by the heart that died
Longing for the world that was
A grace that I cannot resist
And I just want to thank someone
I just want to thank someone for this
Now I can see the world is charged
It's glimmering with promises
Written in a script of stars
I am hounded by a restlessness
Eaten by this endless ache
But still I will give thanks for this
I can feel it when the horses run

Making ready for the reckoning
And when the world is new again
And the children of the king
Are ancient in their youth again
Maybe it's a better thing
To be more than merely innocent
But to be broken then redeemed by love
Maybe this old world is bent
He's crying in the wilderness
I suppose you could lay me down to die in Illinois
Bury me beneath the rows of corn
Where in the Land of Lincoln I was born
We rode the combines in the fall
And there comes a time
For gathering the harvest after all
So when you lay me down to die
Lay me down and let me say goodbye to this world
You can lay me anywhere
But just remember this
When you lay me down to die
You lay me down to live
Well I asked a girl to marry me on a dock out on the lake
Our babies came to life in Tennessee
And the music of the mountains is still keeping me awake
We are more than flesh and bone
What is seen will pass away
What is not is going home
When you lay me down to die
Lay me down and let me say goodbye to this world
You can lay me anywhere
But just remember this
When you lay me down to die
I'll open up my eyes on the skies I've never known
In the place where I belong
And I'll realize His love is just another word for Home
I believe in the holy shores of uncreated light
I believe there is power in the blood
If you set it next to life
I believe it would barely fill a cup
When you lay me down to die
Lay me down and let me say goodbye to this world
You can lay me anywhere
But just remember this
When you lay me down to die
Give us faith to be strong
Our bodies are fragile and weary
As we stagger and stumble to walk where you lead
Give us faith to be strong
Give us faith to be strong
Give us strength to be faithful
Give us grace to go on
Make us willing and able
Give us peace when we're torn
Mend us up when we break
This flesh can be wounded and shaking
When there's much too much trouble for one heart to take
Give us peace when we're torn
Give us faith to be strong
Give us strength to be faithful
Give us grace to go on
Make us willing and able
Give us hearts to find hope
How the sorrow we feel can bring freedom
Give us faith to be strong
Give us strength to be faithful
Give us grace to go on
Make us willing and able
Give us peace when we're torn
I can see the road that lies ahead
I can see the love and the sorrow
Dark nights awake in a stormy bed
So keep to the old roads
Keep to the old roads
And you'll find your way
The first time you know you're not enough
The first time there's no one there to hold you
The first time you pack it all up
And drive alone across America
Please remember the words that I told you
Keep to the old roads
Keep to the old roads
And you'll find your way
If love is what you're looking for
The old roads lead to an open door
And you'll find your way
And I know you'll be scared when you take up that cross
And I love you so much and it's so hard to watch
But you're gonna grow up and you're gonna get lost
Lash your heart to the ancient mast
To the hope that's taken hold of you
And you'll find your way
If love is what you're looking for
The old roads lead to an open door
And you'll find your way
The year we got engaged
And everyone said we were much too young
We got the rings for forty each
From a pawn shop down the road
We said our vows and took the leap
Now fifteen years ago
And we went dancing in the minefields
We went sailing in the storms
And it was harder than we dreamed
But I believe that's what the promise is for
The beginning of the end
Is a good place to begin
Is to lay your own life down
And I believe it's an easy price
For the life that we have found
And we're dancing in the minefields
We're sailing in the storms
This is harder than we dreamed
But I believe that's what the promise is for
That's what the promise is for
So there's nothing left to fear
Till the shadows disappear
And his promises are true
So in the face of all this chaos
So let's go dancing in the minefields
Let's go sailing in the storms
And kicking down the doors
And sailing in the storms
But I believe that's what the promise is for
I heard the call and came
I walked the aisle and I took his hand
I mostly dove right in
From the shallow well
Then I rocked and rolled with a lousy band
Till I heard a song that took my hand
Son of the living God
Son of the living God
All I know is that I was blind
That though I kick and scream
And every step of the way
His grace is making me
With every breath I breathe
So when my body's weak and the day is long
When I feel my faith is all but gone
I'll remember when I sing this song
Son of the living God
Son of the living God
Son of the living God
Son of the living God
Son of the living God
Lost my luggage in Kalamazoo
This is a thing that confounds me
I lose my way and I forget about You
But You still remember me
The rain that falls on the sinner and the saint.
The well that won't run dry
These mercies are made new every morning
And when I think about that prodigal son
I've got to smile when I see the old man run
And I know that You love us the same
Just as if we deserved it
Just as if every one of us fools was worth it
This rain that falls on the sinner and the saints
This well that won't run dry
These mercies are made new every morning
Isn't it love to look down from the sky
And see Your only Son on the cross asking why
And somehow let Him die that way
And not call the whole thing off
All for a man here in Kalamazoo
Who loses his bags and his way sometimes too
But that was something that You already knew
You were called to a land
And didn't know the way
We are children of the
And I long to find it
That the sun that's shining
Is a shadow of the truth
In the dark of the night
I can feel the shadows all around me
Cold shadows in the corners of my heart
But the heart of the fight
Is not in the flesh but in the spirit
And the spirit's got me shaking in the dark
And I long to go there
I can hear the promise
Of the angels of the moon
I can see in the strip malls and the phone calls
The flaming swords of Eden
In the fast cash and the news flash
And the horn blast of war
To the high and lonely mountain in the groaning wilderness
We ache for what is lost
As we wait for the holy God
I was made to go there
Out of this far country
It's enough to make him wonder if he's ever been sane
When he's bleating for comfort from Thy staff and Thy rod
And the heaven's only answer is the silence of God
It'll shake a man's timbers when he loses his heart
When he has to remember what broke him apart
When the crying fields are frozen by the silence of God
And if a man has got to listen to the voices of the mob
Who are reeling in the throes of all the happiness they've got
When they tell you all their troubles have been nailed up to that cross
There's a statue of Jesus on a monastery knoll
All His friends are sleeping and He's weeping all alone
What sorrow is carried by the hearts that he bought
So when the questions dissolve into the silence of God
And rub your tired eyes
Go and kiss your mama
We'll be gone a little while
Come and walk beside me
Come and hold your papa's hand
I go to make an altar
And to offer up my lamb
And in a waking dream He came
Riding on a wind across the sand
And I waited in the dark
The answer was a sword
That came down hard upon my heart
And the Lord I will obey
So take me to the mountain
I will follow where You lead
There I'll lay the body
Of the boy You gave to me
And even though You take him
Still I ever will obey
And the Lord I will obey
And the Lord I will obey
Oh the depth of the riches
Of the wisdom and knowledge of God
How unsearchable his judgment
How unknowable his paths
Who knows the mind of our God
To God be the glory forever and ever
Oh the depth of the riches
Of the wisdom and knowledge of God
How unsearchable his judgment
How unknowable his paths
Who knows the mind of our God
To God be the glory forever and ever
To God be the glory forever and ever
To God be the glory forever and ever
To God be the glory forever and ever
Driving down this road a while
Arizona's waiting on these eyes
And I think we ought to take it slow
Arizona's caught me by surprise
But the photographs don't tell it all
I see the eagle swim the canyon sea
Creation yawns in front of me
And I don't believe that I believed in you as deeply as today
And the mountains sing Your glory hallelujah
The canyons echo sweet amazing grace
The mighty gales are bellowing your name
And I've got nothing to say
I'm broken by this majesty
So much glory in so little time
So turn off the radio
Let's listen to the songs we know
All praise to Him who reigns on high
And I don't believe that I believed in you as deeply as today
And the mountains sing Your glory hallelujah
The canyons echo sweet amazing grace
The mighty gales are bellowing your name
And I've got nothing to say
And the mountains sing Your glory hallelujah
The canyons echo sweet amazing grace
The mighty gales are bellowing your name
And I've got nothing to say
Driving down this road a while
Except about how hard they are to move.
Have you ever stood before them
Like a mustard seed that's waiting for some proof.
It's brave and bittersweet.
And hope is hard to hold to
I'll see your face and Lord I'll know That only love remains.
It's brave and bittersweet.
And hope is hard to hold to
I'll see your face and Lord I'll know
I'll sing your praise and let them go cause only love
Only Your love remains
So I will drive these roads in thunder and in rain
And I will sing your song at the top of my lungs
And I will praise you dear Lord in glory and in pain.
And I will follow you till this race is won
And I will drive these roads till this motor won't run
And I will sing your song from sea to shining sea
And I will praise you Lord till your Kingdom comes
And I will follow were You lead.
I'll see your face and Lord I'll know
I'll sing your praise and let them go...
High noon in the valley of the shadow
When the deep of the valley was bright
When the mouth of the tomb
I've been raised and redeemed
You've lost all your sting
To the victor of the battle
At high noon in the valley
In the valley of the shadow
When that last ragged breath left his lungs
And they reveled and howled
At the war that they thought they had won
The stone rolled away
In the still of the dawn on the greatest of days
High noon in the valley of the shadow
When the shadows were shot through with light
When Jesus took in that breath
And shattered all Death with his life
I've been raised and redeemed
You've lost all your sting
To the victor of the battle
High noon in the valley of the shadow
Let the people rejoice
Let the heavens resound
And freed us forever ring out
All praise to the fighter of the night
Who rides on the light
Whose gun is the grace of the God of the sky
High noon in the valley of the shadow
When the shadows were shot through with light
When the mouth of the tomb
I've been raised and redeemed
All praise to the king
The victor of the battle
High noon in the valley
I've been waiting for the sun
To come blazing up out of the night like a bullet from a gun
I've been waiting for some peace
All creation is aching for the sons of God to be revealed
The serpent struck but it was crushed beneath His heel
But that same wind is gonna blow that storm away
I'm waiting for the change
So I'm waiting for the King
To come galloping out of the clouds while the angel armies sing
He's gonna gather His people in the shadow of His wings
And I'm gonna raise my voice with the song of the redeemed
The storm before the calm
It's the cold before the warm
Sometimes all I see is this darkness
This is the dark before the dawn
I'm just waiting for a change
I had a dream that I was waking
At the burning edge of dawn
And I could see the fields of glory
I had a dream that I was waking
At the burning edge of dawn
And all that rain had washed me clean
All the sorrow was gone
I had a dream that I was waking
At the burning edge of dawn
And I could finally believe
The king had loved me all along
I had a dream that I was waking
At the burning edge of dawn
I saw the sower in the silver mist
I pulled the car off to the side and walked along a starry hill in Idaho
If I was on the outside looking in
Like maybe all the borders of the world were getting thin
And I could see the sky the way it's gonna be again
Every star is a burning flame
Every star is a burning flame
Well yesterday I trimmed the vines and spread the leaves along the ground in Tennessee
And I tried to hold it in my mind that all the light that's coming down takes ages to get to me
And I was on the inside looking out
I was lifted by a solar wind up over the clouds
And I could hear the hosts of heaven singing out loud
Every star is a burning flame
Every star is a burning flame
I remember Mr. Green and I were walking down a busy street in Louisville
The sign said Merton looked around and all the people passing by were shining like the sun and beautiful
And the wonder of it caught him by surprise
I want to look into the night and see a million suns rise
All the heat comes running at the speed of light
From the reaches of space to these faces tonight
And every heart is a burning flame
Do you remember how we used to drive
Over the mountain and down to the river bend
Where the ghosts of the valley all haunt the tracks
The highway calls your stories back again
And all I used to know is in the wind
I don't recognize a thing
I need a brand new song to sing
So tell me the story I still need to hear
Tell me we're gonna make it out alive again
I need to know there's nothing left to fear
There's nothing left to hide
So will you look me in the eye
And say we will survive
Someday the truth's gonna lay us bare
We're gonna raise a glass to the past and say
It's only when the straight line breaks and heals a little crooked
That you ever see the grace
Well I had to find a better place
Maybe the bend in the river's the only way
Got all these voices in my head
I need some hope up there instead
So tell me the story I still need to hear
Tell me about the sun that's gonna rise again
I need to know there's nothing left to fear
There's nothing left to hide
So will you look me in the eye
Do you remember how I used to say
Love is a fire and it's gonna burn us up
To make the space for grace to grow
Now it feels like love has called my bluff
So tell me the story I still need to hear
Tell me about the love that never dies
Tell me the story I still need to hear
Tell me we're gonna make it out alive again
I need to know there's nothing left to fear
There's nothing left to hide
So when you look me in the eye
I know we will survive
I know we will survive
The eye of the hurricane
One look at your face is
All I need to remember my name
Caught in a thunderstorm
You opened the door and welcomed me
I believe in the love of the Father and
I believe in the power of grace
I believe that He brought us together and
You are my one safe place
You're a light in the forest
I am a lost boy out in the trees
It's a weight you were not meant to shoulder
But you bear so much light
And it's brighter each day we get older
And I know that you're broken too
But you are a sacrament God has spoken through
He's spoken through you
And the banner that hovers over us
I believe in the love of the Father and
I believe in the power of grace
I believe that He brought us together and
You are my one safe place
I tried to be brave but I hid in the dark
I sat in that cave and I prayed for a spark
To light up all the pain that remained in my heart
And the rain kept falling
Down on the roof of the church where I cried
I could hear all the laughter and love and I tried
To get up and get out but a part of me died
And the rain kept falling down
Well I'm scared if I open myself to be known
I'll be seen and despised and be left all alone
So I'm stuck in this tomb and you won't move the stone
And the rain keeps falling
Somewhere the sun is a light in the sky
But I'm dying in North Carolina and I
Can't believe there's and end to this season of night
And the rain keeps falling down
There's a woman at home and she's praying for a light
My children are there and they love me in spite
Of the shadow I know that they see in my eyes
And the rain keeps falling
I'm already ashamed of the line I just wrote
But it's true and it feels like I can't sing a note
And the rain keeps falling down
My daughter and I put the seeds in the dirt
And every day now we've been watching the earth
For a sign that this death will give way to a birth
And the rain keeps falling
Down on the soil where the sorrow is laid
And the secret of life is igniting the grave
And I'm dying to live but I'm learning to wait
And the rain is falling
I just want to be new again
I just want to be closer to You again
I'm so tired and I'm always so wrong
Help me be brave tonight
I've been calling and calling
This rain just keeps falling
I've been calling and calling
But this rain just keeps falling and falling
And when the winter is over
The flowers climb through the snow
The willows weep and the clover bloom
Then all at once you hear a song
That's stronger than the noise
And when the peace turns to danger
The nights are longer than days
And every friend has a stranger's face
Then deep within the dungeon cell
You have to make a choice
Be still and know that the Father
Will hasten down from His throne
He will rejoice over you with song
So set your face against the night
And raise your broken voice
I said some words to you I wish I never said
And now my heart is like a catacomb
And I'm praying we can find a way to raise these bones
To close the wounds I opened up
So now I've got this sorrow and you've got that hurt
And we can't go back to who we were
Maybe I can love you better than I failed to do
They'll tell you everything was beautiful and pure
But there was poison in the well from years before
And now I'm cleaning up this wreckage on the shore
And I don't want to fight with you no more
So I want to say I'm sorry that I drew the line
And maybe now the only way to find some peace
Is just to give it time and trust in grace
So this is my communion hymn
You've got all that emotion that's heaving like an ocean
I can hear it in your voice that if you only had a choice
You would rather be anyone else
I love you just the way that you are
I love the way He made your precious heart
I know it's hard to hear it when that anger in your spirit
Is pointed like an arrow at your chest
When the voices in your mind are anything but kind
And you can't believe your Father knows best
I love you just the way that you are
I love the way He's shaping your heart
Well how does it end when the war that you're in
Is just you against you against you
Learn to love your enemies too
You can't expect to be perfect
It's a fight you've gotta forfeit
You belong to me whatever you do
Take a deep breath and believe that I love you
Learn to love your enemies
I cannot explain the ways of love
Life cannot explain the grace of kindness
There's no reason that can satisfy enough
The healing of this blindness
I've been seized by the power of a great affection
I've been seized by the power of a great affection
And even in the days when I was young
There seemed to be a song beyond the silence
The feeling in my bones was much too strong
To just deny it. I can't deny this
I've been seized by the power of a great affection
Seized by the power of a great affection
Now this is the theme of my song
Now I must forgive as I am forgiven
And even when the shadows are long
I will sing about the Son that's risen
That His kingdom has no end
And His kingdom has no end
I will praise Him for the fields of green and gold
I will praise Him for the roar of many waters
I will praise Him that the secret things of old
Are now revealed to sons and daughters
I've been seized by the power of a great affection
I've been seized by the power of a great affection
So Father I will give You thanks and praise
The Son has opened wide the gate of glory
He declared your mighty love and gave His grace
And I will tell his story
I've been seized by the power of a great affection
Seized by the power of a great affection
Now this is the theme of my song
Now I will forgive as I'm forgiven
And even when the shadows are long
I will sing about the Son that's risen
That his kingdom has no end
His kingdom has no end
His kingdom has no end
His kingdom has no end
Torn open like the dirt
And I know that to be healed
That I must be broken first
I am aching for the yield
That You will harvest from this hurt
Let these branches bear You fruit
At the bright edge of the garden
At the golden edge of dawn
At the glowing edge of spring
When the winter's edge is gone
And I can see the color green
Let these branches bear You fruit
Let Your word take root
The branch that bears no fruit
As the rain and the snow fall
And they don't return but they water the earth and bring they forth life
So shall the word of the Lord be with a sound like thunder
We shall be led in peace
And the hills before us
Will raise their voices
And the trees of the field will clap their hands as the land rejoices
And instead of the thorn now
And it will make a name
Make a name for our God
A sign everlasting that will never be cut off
As the earth brings forth sprouts from the seed
What is sown in the garden grows into a mighty tree
To rise before the nations till the end of days
As the rain and the snow fall
And they don't return but they water the earth and they bring forth life
So shall the word of the Lord be with a sound like thunder
We shall be led in peace
And the sower leads us
And the sower leads us
Rewind the best parts
And we'll memorize the lines
I'll call everyone and they can come over
If it keeps things off your mind
Yeah I've got a couple of ideas
Tell me if up for this
You forget for a while
Wrote a song for ya honey
You should laugh so you don't cry
Laugh so you don't cry
You used to love when I came up with surprises
And would drag you off some place
Just get you in a car and out of this house
And I'm here to keep that chin up
It looks like you need cheering up
You forget for a while
Wrote a song for ya honey
You should laugh so you don't cry
Laugh so you don't cry
We're not kissing goodbye
I think its about time that you get yourself out of hiding
You forget for a while
Wrote a song for ya honey
You should laugh so you don't cry
Laugh so you don't cry
This is your song baby
You forget for a while
Wrote a song for ya honey
You should laugh so you don't cry
You should laugh so you don't cry
Laugh so you don't cry
Somebody's up there pulling the strings
It's just like watching gravity fall
And you don't know how
We've gotten into this
Something bigger than us
Our love is something
Something bigger than us
You'll see what I've been trying to say
These stars were arranged
And I thought I found you
I'm not superstitious
Something bigger than us
Our love is something
Something bigger than us
To say that from the Beginning
To the beginning of this day
The ways the world could be spinning
And it had to be this way
Love of a sweeter kind
Love with a patient mind
Bigger than my eyes have ever seen
Than my imagination dreams
Love has given us a sign
And love is something
Something bigger than us
Our love is something
Something bigger than us
I know he had brown eyes
I know she's about my height
I don't have all the details
She said she just moved here
I don't know what she came here to do
She really didn't say much
She really didn't have to
She could already be taken
Outside I bet her boyfriend is waiting but
I know I can't rest in this state I'm in
I don't even know her
But I know I gotta see her again
I wonder what she's up to
I know I need to track her down
I'm searching for some rumors
Like some kind of bloodhound
I hope it wasn't just me
I hope she remembers my name
She could already be taken
Outside I bet her boyfriend is waiting but
I don't even know her
But I know I gotta see her again
Stuck in the back of my mind
Is her looking into my eyes
I'm not gonna rest till I find her
I know she had brown eyes
I know she's about my height
She could already be taken
Outside I bet her boyfriend's waiting but
I can't rest in this state I'm in
I don't even know her
But I know she had brown eyes
I don't even know her but I know she's about my height
Yeah we just met once
Tell me have you seen her
Yeah you can't miss her my friend
She's a tall brunette
Yeah I wanna be taking her our
Just getting ahead of myself
We'll be laughing and seeing what happens
Oh try not to make a fool of myself
When she walked into the room
Yeah she looked at me in the face
And I tried to play it cool
Yeah her brown eyes keep haunting my sleep
Won't let me dream anything else I want
Say we're never spontaneous
Taking a chance and living
I know it's late but we can
We can make it but we might have to drive all night baby
Clothes on our back are plenty
Or you can sleep on my shoulder
Don't wanna ever wonder where the car could have taken us
I'll wake you up when the drive is over
Clothes are back are plenty
Clothes on our back are plenty
I play on the black keys
Where I don't have to worry much
It's already hard enough
To write a song about this
Some people try the white keys
But the thinking hurts my head
So I move back here instead
When you're the one who's on
You just wave goodbye
And you wonder if you'll ever
That's why... I play on the black keys
When it already takes my best
To pretend that this big mess
Yeah I play on the black keys
So that I can close my eyes
Try to picture you beside me
One day I will try and explain it all
But if you don't mind
I'd like some time to try and
If I ever thought it would come to this
The beating and the bleeding
In my every thought I cherished you
I don't have a hat with a brim
And I look funny with a cane
Eleven times out of ten
Even though my Sinatra isn't quite
Like a movie in black and white
Tonight I'm singing to you
Screws and personally show him to the
You say that you're not leaving
There's nothing that I can do
You're a voice is only a tease
It never seems to calm my agony
And though I'm a man of faith
It's hard to believe in what you can't see
When you're gone away
Feel the needles in my feet
And my legs are still asleep
Shake the grass out of the sheets
Throw it all in my back seat
Yeah knowing me and knowing you
The stars could not have had a clue
We never meant to start this thing between us
It just happened that way
Ya know sometimes it does
Sometimes the planets align
And you both lose time
Can't change your mind
Ya just pray for the best
It just happened that way
Just happened that way
We may be the talk of town
Yeah word will get around
They will never understand
It was just an accident
That kinda worked out
Yeah knowing me and knowing you
I think we can both agree
We never meant to start this thing between us
It just happened that way
Ya know sometimes it does
Sometimes the planets align
And you both lose time
Can't change your mind
Just pray for the best
Would you come with me
Our straight and narrow ways just took a turn
We'll take a highway without ever looking back
And in ten years we can laugh at how we got there
Yeah knowing me and knowing you
The stars could not have had a clue
We never meant to start this thing between us
It just happened that way
Ya know sometimes it does
Sometimes the planets align
And you both lose time
Can't change your mind
It just happened that way
Just pray for the best
Oh and I know it's a mess
We'll pray for the best
It just happened that way
And its because the gears that turn my head won't spin and she slips through my hands again and again and again.
And its because the gears that turn my head won't spin and she slips through my hands again and again.
Why do I get so paralyzed
I want to take her by surprise
This road with my eyes closed
And be at your door in a matter of seconds
You'd be outside waiting by the road
And we wouldn't mind getting lost
And at every light where the roads will cross
Thinking in our heads
Another light is another minute
Another kiss that you knew I meant
Grant me just another second
One more chance to gaze into those innocent eyes
Just another red light
I'm sitting in this car
And I'm dragging my feet
And no hurry to tell you this
Grounds for why I think we should end
Oh and now I wouldn't mind getting lost
Like every night since our roads have crossed
Another light means another minute
Another kiss that I thought I meant
Grant me just another second
One more chance before I see those innocent eyes
Just another red light
It felt so real but it was just a dream
I hate what these lies have come to mean
Well I try to carry the load
Didn't want you to know
I'm pulled to the side of the road
Another light means another minute
Another kiss that I thought I meant
Grant me just another second
One more chance before I see those innocent eyes
I came here in a monkey suit
Penguin in my shiny shoes
Boy this is just too much
Boy this is just too much
I thought you said wait on me
That's what you made me believe
Its safe to say that you forgot
You wanted me to tie that knot
We could of had so much
I thought you said wait on me
That's what you made me believe
How come it's so easy for you to forget
I thought you said wait on me
That's what you made me believe
Full moon is shining on this beach
Wrapped in a blanket you and me
The rest of the world slipped out to sea
I'm happy laying here beside you
Let the morning skies come creep up on the night
We'll be waiting here
Isn't a castle in the sand
We'll have another million moons
Oh and it all keeps rising
I'm happy laying here beside you
Let the morning skies come creep up on the night
I heard that the earth had a thing for Venus
Big cities and those skyscrapers they could
And it feels the same with you
Yeah my world gets lonely too
Wherever you are you're never close enough
And I can't get in if you never open up
You push me away and you say you'll never love again
So you go build a wall
And I'll stay here till it falls
Yeah you're always just a few
Steps behind and I just can't find you
I keep it locked away
When you don't have to hide
Breaking your back to cover your tracks
Did it for love or something like that
I don't know who to believe
In so many words you try to explain
How many times can the story get changed
I don't know who to believe
And what's between us just won't add up
Why should I believe in you now
You... call yourself an innocent man
The devil's talking to me as you fall on your face
Angel beside me saying I should be taking your place
I don't know who to believe
There's a criminal part to everyone's heart
I don't know who to believe
Walk away you're free to go home
Won't make her feel better
What she really wants is for
Sweet talk late night
It's not bad but it's not
The same as being home
When I think to myself
Her long kisses do pull me in
I start to miss her again
That would be good for me
High heel walking people
Stealing a look as she
Digs in her pocketbook
I still can't believe
How the girl ended up with a
Minister's son like me
Another night I haven't spoken to her
And she's stuck in my head
You ain't no criminal
You are the victim here
They just don't understand us
Maybe a year from now
People might come around but
Our love is not their business
Watch them put on that righteous skin
Pull out your skeletons
Write your name on the bad list
Well we can put up a fight
Or we can live our lives
Our love is not their business
Our love is not their business
I saw them whispering
Shaking their head like they know
But it ain't black and white
I wish they'd leave us alone
They've got nothing else to do
But look at our lives
How can I make you smile
How can I ease your mind
Should I put on my red dress
Ain't no small town to please
There's only you and me
And our love is not their business
I know he had brown eyes
I know she's about my height
I don't have all the details
She said she just moved here
I don't know what she came here to do
She really didn't say much
She really didn't have to
She could already be taken
Outside I bet her boyfriend is waiting but
I know I can't rest in this state I'm in
I don't even know her
But I know I gotta see her again
I wonder what she's up to

Like some kind of bloodhound
I hope it wasn't just me
I hope she remembers my name
She could already be taken

But I know I gotta see her again
Stuck in the back of my mind
Is her looking into my eyes
I'm not gonna rest till I find her

Outside I bet her boyfriend's waiting but

Just getting ahead of myself
We'll be laughing and seeing what happens
Oh try not to make a fool of myself
When she walked into the room
Yeah she looked at me in the face
And I tried to play it cool
Yeah her brown eyes keep haunting my sleep
Won't let me dream anything else I want
Right in front of our face
It's there when we say goodbye
There's an elephant in the room
We don't look him in the eye
It's time to play our hands
If it's love let's say it is
And we shouldn't be afraid
To call a spade a spade
Tie up our shoes tonight
Tell me what have we been waiting for
When we both know it's right
And tell me what if we never did
Think of the things we'd miss
Let's show our cards and
This morning was all right
Yeah I woke up at lunch time
Went to bed about sunrise and I might
Last night we were downtown
Just some boys getting too loud
Trying to find us a good crowd
Whichever door would let us in
Don't know when we're leaving
But you can bet we'll be gone this evening
A good night to be alive
We earned a degree in
And learned us a lesson
Sometimes a poor boy can't win
We struggle to pay rent
Cause jeans are expensive
Forget that job that deadline
Mom fast asleep doesn't wait up for him
He locks the door walks back in the dark
Whispers a prayer that the dogs won't bark
He hides his other life
Oh... it's another lie set into motion
Whoa... look at what you turned into
Scared of the morning
It's a beautiful day for bad news
Whoa... even when the sky turns blue
You would see a warning
A beautiful day for bad news
And that stain never came out of the floor
Neither did the red on the collar he wore
Oh and momma bear huffing and she's ready to fight
Who's been sleeping in your bed tonight
He looks her straight in the eyes
Oh... it's another lie set into motion
Perfect when it started
Over time yes it fell apart
The truth rings out like a crowd of people and
Innocence louder than cars on the street
Love hears when pain is deafening
I play on the black keys
Where I don't have to worry much
It's already hard enough
To write a song about this
Some people try the white keys
But the thinking hurts my head
So I move back here instead
When you're the one who's on
You just wave goodbye
And you wonder if you'll ever
That's why... I play on the black keys
When it already takes my best
To pretend that this big mess
Yeah I play on the black keys
So that I can close my eyes
Try to picture you beside me
One day I will try and explain it all
But if you don't mind
I'd like some time to try and
If I ever thought it would come to this
The beating and the bleeding
In my every thought I cherished you
I'll write the background music
I'll find a little melody that moves you
You can tell me stories
The look in your eyes
You have the sweetest whisper
Have the sweetest way of being sad
I watch from a distance
Come up with a way to make you laugh
You're putting on your lipstick
Asking me what color dress to wear
Looking out your city window
It's a beautiful night
Salvation Army Santa clause rings his bell when the penny's tossed and I don't know why but I feel lost
Two lovers shopping for a Christmas tree kiss each other when they cross the street and I'm feeling like the joke's on me
Ooh this sneaks up on you like cold weather
Ooh whether or not you're ready it comes
Yeah I don't want to be lonely on the most wonderful time of year
Oh but Christmas time is here
I woke up to find across the street a snowman laying in the manger scene and Charlie brown playing on TV
Ooh this sneaks up on you like cold weather
Ooh whether or not you're ready it comes
Yeah I don't want to be lonely on the most wonderful time of year
Oh but Christmas time is here
Walked outside started thinking about what we had
The bottle of wine we got back together
Decembers you remind me
Yeah I've been by myself
The view from the top
Been thinking about the room that I painted
I built with my own hands
After how long you waited
In that choir we heard
In that catholic church
All the best and the worst
It heals and it hurts
It heals and it hurts to remember
Oh just like that time
Covered up the road and the driveway
The things that you told me
I'm hanging on to them
I'm a car that you would love to have but you wouldn't want to drive
Talk about how I'm all fixed up but I stay covered from the light
And all I wanted I've had it in my hands
But I missed my chance...
But you can't be sure it'll be a good ride
And you hate giving up after how hard you try
So you just make peace and kiss it goodbye
Don't you give me your heart I can't even be trusted with my own
And all you wanted was a story you could tell
But I kept them to myself
But you can't be sure it'll be a good life
And you hate giving up after how hard you try
If I seem like a little too much to handle
If I laugh like an angel on judgment day
If I burn like the sparks from a roman candle
If my heart starts to pound
Like the beat when an old Sun record plays
I used to play it safe
Who knew there'd come a day
I would come alive like this
If I choose the edge over the middle
If I moan at the sound of a certain name
And if I lean just this side of illegal
I used to play it safe
Who knew there'd come a day
I would come alive like this
If I seem like a little too much to handle
If I laugh like an angel on judgment day
If I burn like the sparks from a roman candle
You say you wanna let me go
Well there's on thing that you should know
I'll walk away willingly
And you'll never even hear me leave
Insane with a heart so blue
They'll have to lock me away
And I won't last one day
I never thought I'd see the day
When I have to walk away
But I still think there's a ray of hope
I'll go where you please
But I'll go crazy without you
Insane with a heart so blue
They'll have to lock me away
And I won't last one day
I'll go and take the blame
I'll go down in flames
But I'll go crazy without you
Insane with a heart so blue
They'll have to lock me away
And I won't last one day
Mama didn't like it but I let my hair grow
And I remember you and me
Drawing hearts in the window steam
Holding on to seventeen
Those days ain't ever coming back
Swept away by the winds of change
Time only moves one way
Baby out of all the things I've had to let go
Fumbling through the innocence of my youth
With our initials overlooking the town
Back before they tore the water tower down
And I remember you and me
Drawing hearts in the window steam
Holding on to seventeen
Those days ain't ever coming back
Swept away by the winds of change
Time only moves one way
Baby out of all the things I've had to let go
Life may not always go your way
And every once in a while you might have a bad day
But I promise you now you won't ever be lonely
The sky turns dark and everything goes wrong
Run to me and I'll leave the light on
And I promise you now you won't ever be lonely
For as long as I live
There will always be a place you belong
And I promise you now you won't ever be lonely
It's still gonna snow and it's still gonna rain
The wind's gonna blow on a cold winter day
And I promise you now you won't ever be lonely
You're safe from the world wrapped in my arms
And I'll never let go
And I promise you now you won't ever be lonely
Here's a shoulder you can cry on
And a love you can rely on
For as long as I live
There will always be a place you belong
And I promise you now you won't ever be lonely
In the parking lot at the Dairy Queen
He knew she's gonna be there soon
Then they'll blow this town just like a cheap balloon
So he quit his job and drew his pay
No more bruises that makeup can't hide
All these years she tried to love that man
But all he ever gave her was the back of his hand
Now Jimmy is a young boy just out of his teens
So many things that he still hasn't seen
But he's old enough to know wrong from right
Jimmy listened to everything Shelby had to say
How she'd suffered at her lover's hand
They pulled over to take a little rest
Shelby put her head down on Jimmy's chest
And it sounded like the rhythm of a brand new start
I've lived my life like a one way ticket
About killed myself to prove I was alive
You turned my world around
So don't worry if I'm ever gonna walk the line
I've been known to get a little rowdy
I can get a little loud
I get a little crazy and a little bit out of hand
I got a good side bad side
Sometimes just this side of sanity
But turning my back on you
Is a side of me you'll never see
I've been in the middle
I've been on the edge
Been a diamond in the rough
But Baby I'll bet that you can smooth me out
No I ain't perfect but for what it's worth
You can count on this boy's love
I can see where you might have your doubt
But let me tell you what I'm all about
I've been known to get a little rowdy
I can get a little loud
I get a little crazy and a little bit out of hand
I got a good side bad side
Sometimes just this side of sanity
But turning my back on you
Is a side of me you'll never see
Black smoke rolling from my old rambler
I pulled into Joe's Auto Supply
Desperate for some kind of answer
And I told him about what you had done
He looked at me and he shook his head
And said sorry I can't help you son
I can fix your carburetor
I can rebuild your alternator
I can change the plugs
I can change the wires
Replace all four bald tires
I've got a warehouse full of parts
But I don't know a thing about a broken heart
No I don't know a thing about a broken heart
So I went down to old Doc Miller's
I told the nurse he just had to see me
He took me in when he heard me tell her
That it was an emergency
And then my tears fell like rain
He said I've had at least a million patients
But never one in so much pain
I could write you a prescription
Give you a straight shot of penicillin
I could run a hundred different tests
Or put a stethoscope to your chest
And if it stops I'll give you CPR
But I don't know a thing about a broken heart
No I don't know a thing about a broken heart
So girl that's how I finally wound up at your door
So tell me now where do I start
No I don't know a thing about a broken heart
You changed my life you saved my soul
You let your sweet love shine on me
I found my strength when I lost control
You let your sweet love shine on me
Reflections of the pain and fear
Are closer than they may appear
Almost gone and almost here
Even when the skies are gray
You let your sweet love shine on me
You find a way to find a way
To let your sweet love shine on me
You know I've built those walls
Over what this world is coming to
But walls are not enough for stopping you
You know I've built those walls and sang the blues
Over what this world is coming to
But walls are not enough for stopping you
You're just trying to unwind on a Friday night
Shining on her left hand
And you don't bother to ask her why
She ain't with her man
Cause the right thing to do is
Turn yourself around and point those headlights home
With a woman that ain't your own
That ain't quite black or white
Tosses back her hair looks in your eyes
If danger were a winding road
Then son you just walked a mile
Then a trouble appears and he's got you in his sight
You can feel the heat from the fire in his eyes
Cause the right thing to do is
Turn yourself around and point those headlights home
With a woman that ain't your own
That ain't quite black or white
That ain't quite black or white
And her hair's not quite as long as I had planned.
Five foot three isn't tall
She's not the girl I'd pictured at all.
In those paint by number
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes.
But the moment I looked twice.
I saw the women I was born to love.
When I hold her I don't wanna let go
So it took me by complete surprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes.
More than I dreamed of
More than any man deserves... and I couldn't
Ask for a more than a love like hers
So it took me by complete surprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes.
I looked for trouble and I found it son
Straight down the barrel of a lawman's gun
I'd try to run but I don't think I can
If I move I'm a dead man
Ain't living long like this
I can't live at all like this can I baby
He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back
Then left me freezing on a steel rail rack
I ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this can I baby
Grew up in Houston off a wayside drive
He drove a stock car to an early death
All I remember is a drunk man's breath
Ain't living long like this
I can't live at all like this can I baby
Ain't living long like this
I can't live at all like this can I baby
Make Texas Ruby look like Sandra Dee
I want to love her but I don't know how
Ain't living long like this
I can't live at all like this can I baby
Go on and do it just don't get caught
Ain't living long like this
I can't live at all like this can I baby
The sun is setting on my lonely heart
What I though would be brand new start
Is just a prison cell
Independence was calling my name
Chains around my heart
My soul is burning for that sweet release
Where only moonlight can find us
And all the ties that used to bid us
Freedom's just a prison
Chains around my heart
Been down this street so many times
Could hit the gas and close my eyes
And not touch a thing
The doorways here are always dark
This ain't no lovers lane
Its where infatuation goes
You hit this long strange stretch of road
And you don't know where it leads
Only this will take us there
So baby hold your breath and wrap your arms around me
But it's gonna get rough
This road to Lasting Love
Remember all that got us here
Were gonna need it later
Out the window all around
Dreams in pieces on the ground
You know that faith and hope and trust
Ain't riding in these hearts with us
This trips gonna break em
I've never seen the other side
But girl when you look in my eyes
I've seen it out there
I believe that we can make it baby
But it's gonna get rough
This road to Lasting Love
There's a light up ahead that we all wanna reach
So we grab every chance that we can
But we lose and get lost
Just a few get across
This broken promise land
But it's gonna get rough
This road to Lasting Love
But it's gonna get rough
This road to Lasting Love
And maybe she never really did.
She could move back to her mommas.
And they could split time with the kids.
This ain't no practice life.
We only get one shot.
And it's only Thursday night.
And he's about to lose his wife.
It ain't no practice life.
We only get one shot.
It ain't no practice life.
We only get one shot.
It ain't no practice life.
We only get one shot.
This ain't no practice life.
I've been up and down left and right and wrong so many times
Both sides of the winding road straight down the center line
I crossed paths with the devil With an angel on my side
The first time that I saw you I knew you were the one
But like a fool I ran Like a lonesome highway run
I had my life together now at least a thousand times
But it seem satisfaction never was a friend of mine
The way we laughed the way we cried and how it hurt to say goodbye
I sat an watched a tall oak drop acorns at my feet
And thought about the good times and how good they used to be
But then I watched your memory scatter like dry leaves
Now the wind fades to a whisper but sill I hear your name
I guess that some things in this life are never gonna change
And though every day is different My love for you remains
I had my life together now at least a thousand times
But it seem satisfaction never was a friend of mine
The way we laughed the way we cried and how it hurt to say goodbye
She says I'm a piece of work and I make her laugh
She's got answer for anything I could ask
She knows where I'm going
Well There ain't another like her and I can't believe
That her soul and mine were meant to be
She flew in first class straight from heaven above
She's just like Custom made
When I put my arms around her we just fit
Yeah she's that one in a million
I was born to be heres
She was made to be mine
Well There ain't another like her and I can't believe
That her soul and mine were meant to be
She flew in first class straight from heaven above
She's just like Custom made
Yeah she's that one in a million
I was born to be heres
She was made to be mine
Well There ain't another like her and I can't believe
That her soul and mine were meant to be
She flew in first class straight from heaven above
To where I ought to be.
With only one way from this place.
In the arms of my Angel and my saving grace.
Down a hundred miles of bad road.
Down a hundred miles of bad road.
Is all I'll ever see.
But the burden ain't as heavy as it used to be.
And I ain't sure how you carry this load.
Down a hundred miles of bad road.
Down a hundred miles of bad road.
She's the last girl I thought I'd ever see here
A tattoo of an angel on the small of her back
About then she turned around and kinda stared at me and smiled
She said I had the hots for you in Sunday school class
Now tell me how cool... is that
How cool... is the hot sunlight
When the stars line up and everything feels just right
How cool... when no one's in sight
She brushed her hair back and said let's not talk about the past
How cool... is the hot sunlight
When the stars line up and everything feels just right
How cool... when no one's in sight
I've learned that sex can sell anything on TV.
And I've learned that what you get ain't always what you see.
And I've learned that politics and acting are the same profession.
And the soul gets mighty sick when it goes without confession.
I've learned that the winners don't always have the most talents.
And often the most gifted lives fall out of balance.
And I've learned that you can never lose if you don't give up.
Things I say and shouldn't say.
And do and shouldn't do.
I build back walls that I've torn down.
I hide my heart so it can't be found.
I get lost as lost can be.
I've learned that I'm a taker and I need to be a giver.
And I promise you a whole lot more than I deliver.
Things I say and shouldn't say.
And do and shouldn't do.
I build back walls that I've torn down.
I hide my heart so it can't be found.
I get lost as lost can be.
You see I take a little trip in my old field road
The prettiest site I ever did see was the Cajun girls
On them awesome trees
Cajun fiddled them an old guitar
To drink their tea from a old fruit jar
All the way don't you know
Her brown eyes sparkled
And her hair was long
I asked her to dance to a Cajun song
I never had seen such a pretty smile
Back up the river in my old field road
Got a hold on my mind as she won't let go
I think about her from dust till dawn
Her lips are sweeter than honey in a comb
And I'll fight an alligator
All the way don't you know
Got a hold in my mind as she won't let go
I think about her from dust till dawn
Her lips are sweeter than honey in a comb
And I'll fight an alligator
All the way don't you know
I left for good just the other night
I don't feel light like I thought it would
I can't go home like I wished I could
I do my best just to track her down
Lord they don't say much
Ain't no note Ain't no news
Ain't no clothes and there ain't no shoes
Ain't no car left in the drive
I tried the bottle but it only brings me further down
I've got to get out if get home late its fine with me
Tell me where's a train when you need one
Lord knows I could sure use a ride
Tell me where's a train when you need one
There's a set of rails that cuts a path to eternity
Now baby baby maybe that's the place where I can get you off my mind
I need that lonesome whistle to blow till the end of time
Tell me where's a train when you need one
Lord knows I could sure use a ride
Tell me where's a train when you need one
Tell me where's a train when I need one
Lord knows I could sure use a ride
Tell me where's a train when you need one
The Lord had thought of me.
And that's the way He'll always be.
If I could die for someone.
And watch those people kill me son.
But now I finally see.
I can't count the barns I've passed
And up ahead there's a turn
Takes me right through Gatlinburg
Her hair still wet from her bath
She's sitting on the front porch with a glass of iced tea
If I hurry I can catch
The colors on her skin from that sunset
I wish I were there already
She's the only thing that keeps this world from driving me crazy
I just hit that city limit
Her hair still wet from her bath
She's sitting on the front porch with a glass of iced tea
If I hurry I can catch
The colors on her skin from that sunset
I wanna see how it ends
She thinks I walk on water
She thinks I hung the moon
She thinks I've got it together
She swears I'm as tough as nails
But I don't have the heart to tell her
She don't know me that well
She don't know how much I need her
She don't know I'd fall apart
She don't know that it's all about her
She don't know I can't live without her
And she thinks she needs me
Sometimes she cries on my shoulder
When she's lying next to me
But she don't know that when I hold her
She don't know how much I need her
She don't know I'd fall apart
She don't know that it's all about her
She don't know I can't live without her
And she thinks she needs me
She thinks she's the lucky one
She don't know how much I need her
She don't know I'd fall apart
She don't know that it's all about her
She don't know I can't live without her
And she thinks she needs me
She thinks I walk on water
If you don't wanna spend the rest of this day
Careful where you kiss me
But you know how your soft lips tear me up
Careful where you kiss me
You know every button
You know how to push em
And which ones turn me on
Oh now baby don't stop
I don't know how far you want this to go
But I might just lose control
Careful where you kiss me
I love your sweet good morning baby hugs
But you know how your soft lips tear me up
I love your sweet good morning baby hugs
But you know how your soft lips tear me up
Careful where you kiss me
Careful where you kiss me
The last of the guests are leaving
There's a bottle of red wine still breathing
What do you say we go out there and kill it
And finish off the rest of the evening
Under a blanket of stars
I just wanna lie there
The world can wait till morning
It's time we spent time ignoring
I don't even wanna think about tomorrow
Give yourself some down time
Some times you gotta unwind
Give yourself some down time
Just to keep your sanity
Baby take a deep breath
Nowhere else I'd rather be
Give yourself some down time
When I first saw you that night
Was someone with that something I couldn't walk away from
And I didn't miss that itch to leave
I ended up wrapped around your finger baby
But that was just fine with me
I was swept away like sand
You had me in the palm of your hand
Baby my heart was on the run
I wasn't gonna fall in love
Cause baby you sure did do it well
You made me want you like I've never ever ever wanted
Ever wanted anybody else
Yeah I admit I tried to fight it
And sometimes I fight it still
I'm finding fast that I can't leave you
I was swept away like sand
You had me in the palm of your hand
Baby my heart was on the run
I wasn't gonna fall in love
North Louisiana on a Saturday night
I'll never forget I was 6 years old
With a hillbilly band
Found a few guys and a beat up Ford
Pretty girls would come from miles around
Like bees to honey to hear that sound
All we could afford was bread and mayonnaise
Living for the moment when we'd hit that stage
With a hillbilly band
I got a bus 45 feet long
Bought a house to put a gold record on the wall
Funny thing is I'm hardly there at all
Just give me what I love
With a hillbilly band
I got in my car and let it roll
Headed down a new patch of road
Didn't know how far I'd go
Just got in my car and let it roll
I just smoked my last cigarette
Tell me why do I still see you
Tell me why do I still care
Tell me why do I still feel you
Tell me why do I still see you
Tell me why do I still care
Tell me why do I still feel you
I got my eye on that horizon
I've got my eye on that horizon
Tell me why do I still see you
Tell me why do I still care
Tell me why do I still feel you
You wanna know how long I can walk this straight line
Will I be strong when temptation is messing with my mind
Now baby if you have to ask how long it will last
You wanna know how far I can go on this way
Baby if you have to ask how long it will last
If heaven was a town it would be my town
And everyone I loved was still alive.
Don't cry a tear for me now baby
There comes a time we all must say goodbye
And if that's what heaven's made of
You know I ain't afraid to die.
If heaven was a pie it would be cherry
So cool and sweet and heavy on your tongue
And just one bite would satisfy your hunger
And there'd always be enough for everyone.
If heaven was a train it sure would be a fast one
And if heaven was a tear it'd be my last one
And you'd be in my arms again.
Don't cry a tear for me now baby
There comes a time we all must say goodbye
And if that's what heaven's made of
You know I ain't afraid to die.
I still smell your perfume in the air
This is where a fool would fall apart
But I ain't going there
Won't go down in a burst of flames
Won't stay locked up in your chains
But I won't beg and I won't crawl
A tear or two might fall into my shot of whiskey
But I won't cry no Mississippi
There's nowhere to hide in this small town
I know our paths are bound to cross
I might stand on shaky ground
When I see what I lost but I
Won't go down in a burst of flames
Won't stay locked up in your chains
A tear or two might fall into my shot of whiskey
But I won't cry no Mississippi
Well I Hate to rain on your parade
I Hate to make your bubble bust
It'll take more tears than you could make
To turn my heart into rust
Won't go down in a burst of flames
Won't stay locked up in your chains
But I won't beg and I won't crawl
A tear or two might fall into my
She said howdy friend
But those who know me best call me
Where is your little secret
She said you know I keep it
Since that spring break down in Key West
Oh what a beautiful canvas
For a little tattoo rose
Just maybe you could show me sometime
She said don't think so honey
Boy you should get so lucky
Since that spring break down in Key West
Oh what a beautiful canvas
For a little tattoo rose
Where is your little secret
She said you know I keep it
Since that spring break down in Key West
Oh what a beautiful canvas
For a little tattoo rose
I gotta see that tattoo
I threw that frame against the wall
Washed my hands of all the pieces
I poured another glass
And I asked myself again
I started pacing back and forth
Conjured up a hundred reasons
What if it's me... causing this heartache
Blaming everybody else for the bad breaks
But what if it's me...
Not giving her enough attention
Ignoring all the little things
What if it's me... causing this heartache
Blaming everybody else for the bad breaks
But what if it's me...
And my selfish ways... Me...
The one who needs to change... Me...
Who needs to take the blame
What if it's me... causing this heartache
Blaming everybody else for the bad break
What if it's me causing this heartache
Blaming everybody else for the bad breaks
But what if it's me...
Cadillac on the interstate
Ran a biker in the ditch
Big city lawyer calls
Just put your shoulder in a sling
And your neck in a brace
We're gonna take his butt to court
There's a local politician
Said he needed our vote
He'd put two chickens in every pot
And pave all the county roads
But we ain't seen that son of a gun
Since the day he raised his hand
We're still dodging pot holes
It's all about the money
It's all about the money
A handshake used to be
But now they look you in the eye
With a team of lawyers
They say they're your best friends
As long as you're buying the rounds
They'll tell you jokes and light your smokes
But as soon as you hit some hard times
And the good times disappear
You're all alone and they're all gone
And one thing is so clear
It's all about the money
It's all about the money
It's all about the money
It's all about the money
Nothing I can do is gonna change
God knows I've tried.
I'm stuck here in the past.
And watch the days roll by.
I miss the way you love me.
And I die down deep inside.
Just give me tears and time.
Take it like a river to the sea.
I'm still here all alone.
I call out your name.
And watch the days roll by.
I miss the way you love me.
And I die down deep inside.
Just give me tears and time.
And watch the days roll by.
Pretty city lights down far below
You slide a little closer and whisper in my ear
It's the long way down
Never let me touch the ground
Love for you is such a natural thing
You were born to spread those angel wings
Every time you touch me I swear I feel the light as a feather
But it seems like every other corner I turn
There's another busted heart that's crushed and burned
So baby just remember every time you take me to heaven
It's the long way down
Never let me touch the ground
It's the long way down
Scared I'm gonna fall without you loving arms around
So tell me once again now how we're gonna go
Take me far away from the world below
We could be the few that make it all the way together
Land us both safe on solid ground
After the night girl you gonna have to love me forever
It's the long way down
Never let me touch the ground
It's the long way down
A perfect little house for my perfect little wife
The whole thing turned around
By decisions that we made
Shadows down the hall
Two shadows on the wall
And now there's shadows in my head
No matter how hard I try
I can't outrun the shadows
Just a little comfort on a restless way night
I guess she didn't hear my keys
She didn't think I'd be home
She didn't think I'd see
Shadows down the hall
Two shadows on the wall
And now there's shadows in my head
No matter how hard I try
I can't outrun the shadows
Those intertwining silhouettes
Those dark reflections
Keep resurrecting and I just can't forget...
Shadows down the hall
Two shadows on the wall
Now there's shadows in my head
No matter how hard I try
I can't outrun the shadows
Take you everywhere I go
You can roll down the windows
Turn the knobs on my radio
You can get up in the front seat
Or get down in the back
But you can't drive my Cadillac
You can lay back that rug top
Let the wind blow through your hair
Do your toenails on the dashboard
Slide across those leather seats
But you can't drive my Cadillac
Sweetest scent chromed out wheels
Came off the line big and bad
That I won't do for you
You can't drive my Cadillac
Sweetest scent chromed out wheels
Came off the line big and bad
You can slide across those leather seats
And climb up in my lap
But you can't drive my Cadillac
I'll admit it got to me hearing your voice on my machine
It took all I had to just let you talk and not pick up where we left off
Cause every night since your goodbye I hit my knees and close my eyes
And I pray you'd come back
Too many tears washed out that bridge you wanna cross
Last night would've been a different story
But the morning sun must've done something for me
If you'd called yesterday
This victory runs bittersweet through the heart and soul of me
And I pray you'd come back
Too many tears washed out that bridge you wanna cross
Last night would've been a different story
But the morning sun must've done something for me
Last night would've been a different story
But the morning sun must've done something for me
Some men are destined to live out their lives where they are
I'm always drawn to the echo of some distant trail
I've come to accept all the things I know I'll never change
I swung a hammer till my hands were blistered and sore
I've loaded trucks till my back couldn't take anymore
I've come to accept all the things I know I'll never change
At the end of the highway they'll chisel my name in the stone
I've come to accept all the things I know I'll never change
A sassy style that'll drive you crazy
And they hold you like the light
Holds a wick when there's candle's burning
Them Creole babies thin and brown and downright amazing
And they roll just like river a little wave lasts forever
The sachet bag the sachet bag
I swear for live love and laughter
And they'll hold you like a night
Them Creole babies they strut and sway from dusk till dawn
And they roll just like river one little wave will last forever
All the way from Bourbon Street to Esplanade
The sachet bag the sachet bag
All the way from Bourbon Street to Esplanade
The sachet bag the sachet bag
All the way from Bourbon Street to Esplanade
Staring up at the ceiling
Your sweet perfume hangs in this room
And I can't shake these feelings
I still see you looking at me
With that wanting me look in your eyes
You're like a sweet melody
That just keeps haunting me
I can't get you out of my mind
You're burning a hole in my head
Lying alone in this bed
It's your touch it's your kiss girl
You're burning a hole in my head
Reliving each word that you said
Needing you in my arms feeling you in my heart
I keep telling myself everything that I felt
Was all in the moment
You left this flame and I just can't control it
You're like an unquenchable thirst
That just keeps getting worse all the time
You just won't go away all I see is your face
Every time I close my eyes
You're burning a hole in my head
Lying alone in this bed
You're burning a hole in my head
Reliving each word that you said
Needing you in my arms feeling you in my heart
Can't believe this is me
But I know I can't let you go
When you keep on holding on
You're burning a hole in my head
Lying alone in this bed
It's your touch it's your kiss girl
You're burning a hole in my head
Lying alone in this bed
Needing you in my arms feeling you in my heart
Burning a hole in my head a hole in my head
Just keeps moving covering ground
You can't hold it it's always rolling
When you're not looking it's gonna steal you blind
Hides in the shadows takes what it wants
Like a desperado that can't be caught
You can't stop it you can't lock it
How we wasted it and let love grow cold
When I finally saw how far you were gone
I tried to reach you but I couldn't hold on
When I finally saw how far you were gone
I tried to reach you but I couldn't hold on
Time is a healer that's what they say
With the light of tomorrow I can't seem to find
I'm stuck in the world that's left me behind
But it's turning and God knows I'm learning
And you don't bother to ask her why she ain't with her man
And point those headlights home
With a woman that ain't your own
That ain't quite black or white
Tosses back her hair and looks in your eyes
If danger were a winding road
Then a trouble appears and he's got you in his sight
And you can feel the heat from the fire in his eyes
And point those headlights home
With a woman that ain't your own
That ain't quite black or white
That ain't quite black or white
But I know what I need
But I don't have it all
That I just wanna do love to
That I just wanna do love to
But that just doesn't do me
If I can't get you soon
That I just wanna do love to
Baby light a couple candles
Lock the bedroom door
Put on some sweet soul music
Throw a blanket on the floor
Surrender to my patient hands
All week I've been your husband
Tonight I wanna be your man
It hit me just this morning
When I passed you in the hall
I swear I caught you looking
Like you don't know me at all
Let me show you who I am
All week I've been your husband
Tonight I wanna be your man
I'll always be your cover when your cold
When the world lines up against you
I'm the safe place you can go
Now and then we need to find some time to be in love
Now the whole world's in bed sleeping
I think we're finally alone
If the telephone starts ringing
We'll pretend like we're not home
All week I've been your husband
Tonight I wanna be your man
Let me show you who I am
All week I've been your husband
Tonight I wanna your man
Just forget about that wedding band
All week I've been your husband
I got in my car and let it roll
Headed down a new patch of road
Didn't know how far I'd go
I just smoked my last cigarette
I got my eye on that horizon
I've got my eye on that horizon
Caught by what comes by
Stand alone without a fare chance tonight
Here again by your side when
They turn on all the lights
Yes I'll follow you tonight
Using white lies if we have to
It's easy to forgive and forget it all tomorrow
My last way out and worst mistake tonight
Lying lips wont say my eyes give me away
Wont you please turn out the light
And I'll follow you tonight
I'll follow you tonight
The worst mistake to make
Or just a kind of promise you simply have to break
So please turn out the lights
With hope of finding more
Not feel shallow not get bored
And just as low as I was high the night before
The worst mistake to make
Or just a kind of promise you simply have to break
So please turn out the lights
I'm not your world to blame
I'm not your world to blame
And it's been going on
Since you gave me love I gave right back
And it's been to long
Find another shoulder to cry on
Find another shoulder to cry on
Step out of the shadow
Step out of the dark and face the sun
You'll get along without her
You'll get along just fine with what you have
To complicate your life you need no love
Step out of her shadow
Soon all the pain within is gone
Every promise every place behind
I just happened to feel so alone
For today for all days to come
I just wanna be wanna be gone
I just wanna be wanna be gone
Broken feelings of dreams out of sight
Pictures in your head at night
For tonight for all nights to come
Erased for good and always gone
Erased for good and always gone
Young people far to old
Let me cross a very fine line
For today for a lifetime
For today for a lifetime
Every promise every place behind
I just happened to feel so alone
For today for all days to come
For today for all days to come
After years of having you as a weight on my heart
We've had our last round
Your words are weightless
They once weighed gold
And had me spellbound
You belong to the past
I'm not crying over you
You're just a friend at last
But you will play no part
After years of having you as a weight on my heart
The stone turned to air at last
You belong to the past
I'm not crying over you
You're just a friend at last
After years of having you as a weight on my heart
It's obvious to me that you belong to the past
I'm not crying over you
You're just a friend at last
Today must have been one of the strangest days
Some would say that you won't find love that way
The best days are not planned by common sense
You just happen to be where everything feels fine
It's a new secret I have found
It's a new secret I have found
From today I'll change my priorities around
I'm off solid ground and you're to blame
It's a new secret I have found
It's a new secret I have found
It's a new secret I have found
It's a new secret I have found
Today must have been one of the strangest days
I found a place where I could stay
But they don't understand
To be senseless to change my plans for you
It's a new secret I have found
It's a new secret I have found
It's a new secret I have found
It's a new secret I have found
Something striking hard tonight
And it's causing confusion
Across the borders of my mind
Across the borders of sadness
Please someone help me out today
I don't think I handle my friends too well
Please someone try to understand
I never meant to hurt anyone
Nothing left for anyone
There's nothing left for you
Bad conscience striking hard tonight
And it's wounding me badly
I need a safer place to hide
I need new friends to forgive me
Please someone try to understand
I never meant to fail anyone
There's nothing left for you
Nothing left for anyone
There's nothing left for you
The moon might blind us
And nothing left for anyone
By the end of the day
Left only with my godless mind
By the end of the night
Falling star is your guiding light
In the way that you're so fine
Voice is calming you down
On your knees running fast
Either God are escaping your past
Who will give you answers
Who will give you answers
Lately you've been bothered by your friends
Try to find the other side of you
We won't let you squeeze right through
Give you second chances easily
But the sadness in your eyes won't go away
I wonder were you come from
But my guess is right you break like glass
I won't let you squeeze right through
Oh how sweet a girl like you can be
You're changing skin like I change clothes
You're faking it well but it shows
Better lock up well before they come
Better lock up well before they come
We won't let you squeeze right through
Not the first time I saw you
But I knew I want to spend some time
Half a day then a half a life time pass by
I made for you my dear
As close as one can get
I won't let you down this time
I won't let you down this time
This is our time for all times starting from today
Oh he takes her to the sky they say
She puts him on his feet again
I won't let you down this time no no
I won't let you down this time
Every promise every place behind
I just happened to feel so alone
For today for all days to come
I just wanna be wanna be gone
I just wanna be wanna be gone
Broken feelings of dreams out of sight
Pictures in your head at night
For tonight for all nights to come
Erased for good and always gone
Erased for good and always gone
Young people far to old
Let me cross a very fine line
For today for a lifetime
For today for a lifetime
Every promise every place behind
I just happened to feel so alone
For today for all days to come
For today for all days to come
I better laugh in 20 years from now
With some perspective and dedication
I will find somebody new
It better be someone special
He Better be coming very soon
It better be for real this time
I hope I'm wrong before I die of boredom
Days and nights when I amuse
He better be someone special
He better be devoted just like you
It better be for real this time
Another girl will change your mind
In less than half the summer
Something that I couldn't give you
I talk as if it's now but nothing is new
She better be someone special
She better be more in love than me
And if I was your brightest hour
Caught by what comes by
Stand alone without a fare chance tonight
Here again by your side when
They turn on all the lights
Yes I'll follow you tonight
Using white lies if we have to
It's easy to forgive and forget it all tomorrow
My last way out and worst mistake tonight
Lying lips wont say my eyes give me away
Wont you please turn out the light
And I'll follow you tonight
I'll follow you tonight
The worst mistake to make
Or just a kind of promise you simply have to break
So please turn out the lights
With hope of finding more
Not feel shallow not get bored
And just as low as I was high the night before
The worst mistake to make
Or just a kind of promise you simply have to break
So please turn out the lights
Forever lost in 90 days
From early march till late in may
Then I pulled out in a day
To catch my breath some place far away
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I
Tomorrow morning set me free
For many nights you'll never sleep
When I'm far from reaching out of sight
Enough to get me on my high tonight
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I
Forever lost in 90 days
From early march till late in may
All to say no one brings you down like I
All to say farewell for now
Lately you've been bothered by your friends
Try to find the other side of you
We won't let you squeeze right through
Give you second chances easily
But the sadness in your eyes won't go away
I wonder were you come from
But my guess is right you break like glass
I won't let you squeeze right through
Oh how sweet a girl like you can be
You're changing skin like I change clothes
You're faking it well but it shows
Better lock up well before they come
Better lock up well before they come
We won't let you squeeze right through
By now my mind is clear
You planted all the fear
Doubts and despair and
You keep my heart on the run
I'm bound to fall in love with the one
I sadly smiled for two
And his head went down
And he wore my heart like a crown
And ever since i fall for the one
By the end of the day
Left only with my godless mind
By the end of the night
Falling star is your guiding light
In the way that you're so fine
Voice is calming you down
On your knees running fast
Either God are escaping your past
Who will give you answers
Who will give you answers
Haven't you noticed there is someone outside
Looking through our window when we sleep at night
You must not leave me alone anymore
Awake all night worried for
You to be with somebody else
Time to be with somebody else
Didn't I tell you about the dream I had last night
We were both in it and everything seemed so right
When I opened up my eyes see you standing beside our bed
I remember what he said
To be with somebody else
It's time to be with somebody else
For one to hold and for want you
It's time for you to be with someone like me
Somebody touched me and whispered in my ear
Come a little bit closer there's nothing for you to fear here
So I left your side and followed my own voice now
The window was open but he was gone
And I went back to you
To be with somebody else
It's time to be with somebody else
For one to hold and for want you
Today must have been one of the strangest days
Some would say that you won't find love that way
The best days are not planned by common sense
You just happen to be where everything feels fine
It's a new secret I have found
It's a new secret I have found
From today I'll change my priorities around
I'm off solid ground and you're to blame
It's a new secret I have found
It's a new secret I have found
It's a new secret I have found
It's a new secret I have found
Today must have been one of the strangest days
I found a place where I could stay
But they don't understand
To be senseless to change my plans for you
It's a new secret I have found
It's a new secret I have found
It's a new secret I have found
It's a new secret I have found
Ever since I was eight or nine
I've been standing on the shoreline
For something lasting
Get confused and you fade away
Kills you when you are young
Kills you when you are young
I'm not the boy I used to be
This town has got the youth of me
From the work of sorrow
Standing on the paving
By the office building
They've got so much to do
You die when you're young
You die when you're young
Every promise every place behind
I just happened to feel so alone
For today for all days to come
I just wanna be wanna be gone
I just wanna be wanna be gone
Broken feelings of dreams out of sight
Pictures in your head at night
For tonight for all nights to come
Erased for good and always gone
Erased for good and always gone
Young people far to old
Let me cross a very fine line
For today for a lifetime
For today for a lifetime

And I went back to you
To be with somebody else
It's time to be with somebody else
For one to hold and for want you
All marks on my body vanished in a day.
As long as you're with someone and never left alone.
As long as you're with someone never left alone.

If I could turn the page
In time then I'd rearrange just a day or two
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day to believe in you
Tell me sweet little lies
Although I'm not making plans
I hope that you understand there's a reason why
No more broken hearts
We're better off apart let's give it a try
Tell me sweet little lies
Tell me sweet little lies
If I could turn the page
In time then I'd rearrange just a day or two
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day to believe in you
Tell me sweet little lies
Tell me sweet little lies
I could escape this feeling with my china girl
I feel a wreck without my little china girl
Saw their stars crashing
I'm a mess without my little china girl
Wake up in the morning where's my little china girl
Saw their stars crashing down
I feel tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my china girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my china girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
It's in the white of my eyes
And when I get excited
My little china girl says
Baby just you shut your mouth
Shades of sleep have driven you away.
The moon is pale outside
And you are far from here
Breathing shifts your careless head
Untroubled by the chaos of our lives
Has taken you again my dear
And you know that I'm gonna be the one
When you need someone to depend upon
Last night while you were lying in my arms
I was wondering where you were
You know you looked just like a baby
Fast asleep in this dangerous world
Every star was shining brightly
Like a million years before
We were feeling very small
Underneath the universe
And you know that I'm gonna be the one
When you need someone to depend upon
And you know that I'm gonna be the one
When you need someone to depend upon
My head is spinning round
My heart is in my shoes
I must come back down
She's laughing in her sleeve boys
I can feel it in my bones
I'm gonna call my home
Seems that my pockets filled with gold
And the clouds they've covered over
The wind is blowing cold
And I don't need anybody
I know a girl laying down
And when she wakes up
Counting cracks in the ceiling
I left her fifteen years behind
So much for girl staying
The world on a screen
And God knows I tried to leave her
But she's got a constant fever
I let it slip my mind
I left her fifteen years behind
I know a girl laying down
We have something in common
As well as my mind is
It's not with you for sure
I intend to stay away for good
Just a matter how I define
I have so many holes to fill
At least seven nights a week
When I shared it with you
Just a matter how I define
Just a scratch on my ego
I get up in the morning
If we could plan tomorrow
I'll be keeping my mind cold
When the hours forget me
And the waiting awakes me
And the voices of madness
Just singing songs of sadness
Today is such a good day
She'll ask you where you've been
When you finally come home
Make sure to erase all your outgoing calls
Why trouble her lonely soul
She doesn't have to know
She doesn't have to know
She's such a lonely soul
She'll be watching you for sure
What she already knows
And she'll try to stay calm
And she's still in love
Why trouble her lonely soul
She doesn't have to know
She doesn't have to know
She's such a lonely soul
Missed the common life we had
Monday mornings and quiet nights
Was it gift if you ask me now
You want apartment outside town
I miss Saturdays when your kids came by
Fussing hard to accept
But who can choose the love they get
You never measured up
Your life wasn't good enough
But who am I to judge you now
I think my time is running out
Nothing lasting within inside
How should I stay calm
When panic lies just ahead
Everyone can see my youth
I'm one of few who's left
When everyone has gone
And it's too late to get on
For another broken promise
To slip my mind by mistake
Who would take my word
On anything these days
I failed so many times
Saying I'm gonna change
Please put me to sleep
If there's room beneath your feet
I could not get used to living alone
Lay your head on my chest
Just to see how you say goodbye
Maybe I could be yours
Maybe you could be mine
Maybe my time has come
Please put me at ease
Now my soul is ready for peace
Give me the lover's curse
Now I am ready for you
Maybe I could be yours
Maybe you could be mine
Maybe my time has come
Maybe I could be yours
Maybe you could be mine
Maybe I could be yours
I know you have no place left to go
I've been replaced by you before
I'm just another corpse along your road
Can win my sympathy this time
Above your head today
Saying you're a changed man now
Above your head today
Feels like sand in my eye
Giving every promise bitter ends
Disappointment walks with you my friend
And I am not the only one you hurt
A dozen times or more
Regretful eyes can't win my sympathy this time
Above your head today
Saying you're a changed man now
Above your head today
Waking up was kind of strange
The past two years have made a change
You are barely on my mind
Saying goodbye sure takes time
Today you should turn twenty five
With your best time flying by
Not knowing where your future lies
And all prepared to conquer life
We get no answers from the past
No how the fire spread so fast
But New Year's Eve all turned black
Sometimes you're lucky
Voices hard and hollow
Colder than I ever was before
I'm leaving you pieces
Of love to come for more
You always find me miles from where
I said you must let go
Or nothing sounds convincing
To the one you can't say no
Who could possibly save
Love is the common name
It's bittersweet to swallow
Kindness as a consequence of guilt
So gather up the pieces
Of your last and dying will
And prepare yourself to live with
Whatever follows pain
Who could possibly save
Love is the common name
Make the wrong turn you know
If you're thinking of going
Who's taking you down there
Round the corner of love
Is as far as you come
Halfway with high hopes
Is as far as you come
Halfway with high hopes
Haven't been for so long
You keep your eyes on me
Love of mine don't lend a hand
Yours are just keeping me down
And I've been down for so long
Love likes to hold on
Violent explosions no one but I can hear
Words as defense aren't enough
And I've been quiet for too long
You keep your eyes on me
Violent explosions no one but I can hear
I know a girl laying down
And when she wakes up
Counting cracks in the ceiling
I left her fifteen years behind
So much for girl staying
The world on a screen
And God knows I tried to leave her
But she's got a constant fever
I let it slip my mind
I left her fifteen years behind
I know a girl laying down
We have something in common
Let the curtain fall on me and you
Let the lights go out and blow out the fuse
No strings attached between me and you
You mean nothing to me anymore
Acquainted as we are expected to be
You remind of not letting go
Disabled by fear to be on my own
Having a twin as your lover
You mean nothing to me anymore
Acquainted as we are expected to be
Can you keep a secret
I'm just as weak as you
Afraid of living without you
Afraid of dying out of love
It's a new thing I have for you
But the loneliness is gone
Some kind of space we live in
Emptiness grows from inside
On our own we are weightless
With you I stand my ground
Always be better half of me
It's a new thing I have for you
But the loneliness is gone
Gone gone gone black widow
Gone gone gone in a dying meadow
I just opened up my window
Gone gone gone in the deep slumber
Gone gone gone as ice melted in summer
I just opened up my window
Lay my head against my pillow
Please put me to sleep
If there's room beneath your feet
I could not get used to living alone
Lay your head on my chest
Just to see how you say goodbye
Maybe I could be yours
Maybe you could be mine
Maybe my time has come
Please put me at ease
Now my soul is ready for peace
Give me the lover's curse
Now I am ready for you
Maybe I could be yours
Maybe you could be mine
Maybe my time has come
Maybe I could be yours
Maybe you could be mine
Maybe I could be yours
This may be the last chance
Finding the highlands
I swear I'll take you there
You'll never forget me
I swear I'll amaze you
Maybe that could save us
Maybe that could save us
There's no one to save
And up until now I never knew
I swear I'll take you there
You'll never forget me
I swear I'll amaze you
Maybe that could save us
I've never felt so calm
You would never upset me
I sense a lack of fear
Ever since the day we moved here
Nothing frightens me at all
No one here falls in love
I fall asleep on someone's arm
Are too quiet and too calm
Winds don't blow here
But I'll never be untrue
No I swore to never leave you
And I always keep my word
And I never lose my way
You know there's just one road for us to walk down
Now let's see how far it goes
I want to fall in love
And maybe you're not the one
But perhaps you could be
But if loving you is hard
But the current in this water
Is not as rapid as the flow
Of love when it washes over
And one time I saw it coming
But I was too afraid of letting go
So I let it flow right past me
I think we fell in love
Yes I think he was the one
But perhaps you could be
But the nights here are so still
Words of love sent by you
Any way you get them through
Words of love trouble me
Feels like someone's watching me
Loving hands around my throat
Sounds like panic in my head
Tie the strings and I play dead
I've erased every line you wrote
In my head and on my floor
She'll ask you where you've been
When you finally come home
Make sure to erase all your outgoing calls
Why trouble her lonely soul
She doesn't have to know
She doesn't have to know
She's such a lonely soul
She'll be watching you for sure
What she already knows
And she'll try to stay calm
And she's still in love
Why trouble her lonely soul
She doesn't have to know
She doesn't have to know
She's such a lonely soul
Please put me to sleep
If there's room beneath your feet
I could not get used to living alone
Lay your head on my chest
Just to see how you say goodbye
Maybe I could be yours
Maybe you could be mine
Maybe my time has come
Please put me at ease
Now my soul is ready for peace
Give me the lover's curse
Now I am ready for you
Maybe I could be yours
Maybe you could be mine
Maybe my time has come
Maybe I could be yours
Maybe you could be mine
Maybe I could be yours
Please put me to sleep
If there's room beneath your feet
I could not get used to living alone
Lay your head on my chest
Just to see how you say goodbye
Maybe I could be yours
Maybe you could be mine
Maybe my time has come
Please put me at ease
Now my soul is ready for peace
Give me the lover's curse
Now I am ready for you
Maybe I could be yours
Maybe you could be mine
Maybe my time has come
Maybe I could be yours
Maybe you could be mine
Maybe I could be yours
She likes to call him
Wake him at night when he's in bed
Hangs up when he says his name
She gets excited by the thought that
He's afraid she might come back
Who could possibly save
Love is the common name
Again they depend on the one to blame
He's got that creepy feeling
Everyone they know says
Who could possibly save
Love is the common name
I've been everywhere to find you
I've gone through every stage of waiting
Deep down I know that I still love you
I always have and I always will
So I keep on searching until I find you
Writing these letters every day
I like the fact that you depend on me
In every possible way
When your eyes wander off desperately
That you never look straight
I enjoy when you hesitate
Somehow it's keeping me safe
Everything slips away
I don't mind you taking after me
No thoughts of your own
Lost for words repeating constantly
In fact it calms me down
Everything slips away
Gets me through the day
Everything slips away
Words of love sent by you
Any way you get them through
Words of love trouble me
Feels like someone's watching me
Love and hate lie not close
Hurt the ones we love the most
We don't need a reason to
Sharing every thought
Sending words of love
I'm afraid you lost your mind
I'm gone for good and I won't come back
The sad harsh and naked truth
Sharing every thought
You are my everything
I could give all again
I'm never short of anything with you
All good things now come from you
I hope you feel the way I do
I hope you give yourself up too
I'm damned to feel the way I do
What have I done to fall so hard
The past the present tomorrow too
I'll spend my final day with you
I hope you feel the way I do
I hope you give yourself up too
I'm damned to feel the way I do
What have I done to fall so hard
I hope you feel the way I do
I hope you give yourself up too
I'm damned to feel the way I do
What have I done to fall so hard
Maybe we are the damaged ones
On my knees in a faceless crowd
We go blind when the stakes are high
I'm on my knees can you see me now
Maybe we are the damaged ones
You and I in a shameless state
Maybe we are the damaged ones
No one I'll rather be with than you
My head explodes and my mind's a mess
And I'm dying to move like young boys do
No one I'll rather be with than you
Away with the bothers and the saddest of news
And this part terrifies me so
No one makes me free like you make me
But the beast in my sleeps oh so peacefully
He's reminded of her when he looks at me.
That's how all things grow
Hard to believe how people move
Falling out of love with you
What brought us to this
What places we blindly passed
When things really mattered
When simply being was easy
Just having you there
We laughed and cried our way through
Nothing could come between us then
That thought would never leave us
Love needles in the hay
Nothing could come between us then
That thought would never leave us
Nothing could come between us then
That thought would never leave us when
Nothing could come between us then
In the shape of a black boot aiming for his had
Save your tears for a white love who deserves your prayers
You don't need matches to make something burn
Left me your ashes and walked away
All I can think of is how to get back
Taking it day by day ...
Make it on my own again
Make it on my own again
Just in time to feel the breeze across his face
That night the sky turned white
You don't need matches to make something burn
Left me your ashes and walked away
All I can think of is how to get back
Taking it day by day ...
Make it on my own again
Make it on my own again
Make it on my own again
Not the sound of rain against my windowpane
You said I was a hole of desperate need
Fine white sheep and candles too
No one talks straight at you just outside the hallway
Most people here still think of you
From the doorway watching you sleep
From the doorway watching you sleep
Off the road somewhere I don't know
In your car for hours and days
Pass small cities and big ones too
Music my father played me when
I was a child just like now
I never once thought that feeling could die
Those days came and went
Then you get taken by life by accident
And you wake up somewhere in the shade
Overloaded by what you made yourself
Just as long as I feel it blow
Music my father played me when
I never once thought that feeling could die
On the black Sunday afternoon
Sun is pale like the moon
When you look to the sky
On the black Sunday afternoon
No good time to walk alone
On a bike riding home
When you look to the sky
On the black Sunday afternoon
Bad luck come at just a car
On the right side hears a call
And sees a black ref flying low
Bother head no mistletoe
On black Sunday afternoons
And on the back of your head
A lump and just a tiny hole
Almost no light at all in here
You can't hear your own voice at all
Well have you been where the rivers cross
By the water in the moss
On black Sunday afternoons
Sun is pale like the moon
When you look to the sky
I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps
If you can use some exotic booze
There's a bar in far Bombay
And he'll toot his flute for you
Once I get you up there
Where the air is rarefied
Once I get you up there
I'll be holding you so near
Just say the words and we'll beat the birds
Once I get you up there
Where the air is rarefied
Once I get you up there
I'll be holding you so near
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing for evermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing for evermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
That's what all the people say
But I know I'm gonna change that too
And as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks
But I don't let it get me down
Cause this final world keep spinning around
That's what all the people say
Right and high in April and you shut down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that too
Strangers in the night exchanging glances
What were the chances we'd be sharing love
Before the night was through
Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you
We were strangers in the night
When we said our first hello
Love was just a glance away
Ever since that night we've been together
It turned out so right
For strangers in the night
Love was just a glance away
Ever since that night we've been together
It turned out so right
For strangers in the night
What brought us to this
What places we blindly passed
When things really mattered
When simply being was easy
Just having you there
We laughed and cried our way through
Nothing could come between us then
That thought would never leave us
Love needles in the hay
Nothing could come between us then
That thought would never leave us
Nothing could come between us then
That thought would never leave us when
Nothing could come between us then
Maybe we are the damaged ones
On my knees in a faceless crowd
We go blind when the stakes are high
I'm on my knees can you see me now
Maybe we are the damaged ones
You and I in a shameless state
Maybe we are the damaged ones
By now my mind is clear
You planted all the fear
Doubts and despair and
You keep my heart on the run
I'm bound to fall in love with the one
I sadly smiled for two
And his head went down
And he wore my heart like a crown
And ever since i fall for the one
Not the first time I saw you
But I knew I want to spend some time
Half a day then a half a life time pass by
I made for you my dear
As close as one can get
I won't let you down this time
I won't let you down this time
This is our time for all times starting from today
Oh he takes her to the sky they say
She puts him on his feet again
I won't let you down this time no no
I won't let you down this time
He's reminded of her when he looks at me.
That's how all things grow
I'll dance to tonight
Safe as long as I'm moving
No one touches me now
Free myself from heavy guilt on my shoulders
Stillness in the cold
Peace comes crawling up my bone
I am moving away from you
I am moving away from you
Let go what I hold in my hands
Let go what I hold in my heart
Ocean helps man to forget
I am moving away from you
I am moving away from you
And if I surrender my life to the sea
You can marry another it's alright with me
Just imagine the treasures I'll bring
I will remember you all winter long
When I return to the one that I miss
When the mornings are warm and the valleys are green
I'll come back from wherever I've been
She was such an eager companion
I've never seen a pair of eyes more alone
Safety in the arms of a stranger
Hoping his ship would finally bring her home
Count your blessings if it gets tough
With each gift comes a loss
He was imprisoned by his own mind
Troubled after years of never letting go
He could drink all the way to blindness
Count your blessings if you feel stuck
If the road gets dark and you feel lost
We all pay our own costs
They were such eager companions
See them stumble on the most precious dreams
Make a life between the wave break
Catching breath in an ocean of steel
Count your blessings if you lose touch
If loves not giving and you had enough
Leave and nothing will be lost
Would you believe me if I said
With you I was numbing all my pain
I will always bury my head in the sand
I guess it's true what people say
We never really change
If I was strong enough to stay
You would always carry your burdens alone
You will always be waiting
And wave from the shore
I thought I could be good
Must have been dreaming
We must have been dreaming
Let's give it up for the rain
Heavy fall and a halo
Hours of holding the time
Like a stone in the palm of your hand
Lovely days by your side
Let's give it up for the fool
Words falling carelessly
Each joke holds a belief
For sad people like you and me
For all the loveliness
Let's take a walk on the beach
Feel the sand beneath our feet
Fall asleep in the shade
After a swim in the ocean
Get dry on sandy rocks
In the black out of light
I found a rhyme on hope
In the corner of doubt
Someone left a word hanging on to me still
The making of a slow day
I draw a pair of new eyes in my mind
Reaching out who knows what I could find
In blue hours of dawn
Before the day rushes on
And confusion grabs hold
Have the thoughts come and let go
I draw a pair of new eyes in my mind
Reaching out who knows what I could find
In the black out of light
I found a rhyme on hope
In the corner of doubt
Someone left a word hanging on to me still
The beautiful women he met
I begged him to leave you
Saying that together we'll be free
Oh my minds fucked up
I even thought I could get out
He wakes up with a mouth too sweet
He still makes me bleed
Amazed by the white linen sheet
Placed over your head
Out of the steel beds
Released from your head
Thinking kills us all in the end
Over your head on the wall
No name on your badge anymore
Your face in the wind being 5 maybe 6
Without wings you fly
Out of the steel beds
Released from your head
Thinking kills us all in the end
Over your head on the wall
No name on your badge anymore
Amazed by the white linen sheet
Placed over your head
Over your head on the wall
Get up on your feet and walk
There is the one ceiling the lies
A fine veil over your eyes
Your hopes while you're slaving for time
This is the one who knows no regret
Who knows who you are
But one day he'll find you
Owner of land he never walked on
Without a doubt he knows how to count your tears
There is the one ceiling the lies
A fine veil over your eyes
Wake up one day and you'll realize how
Hard you've been running most of your life
Without a doubt he knows how to count your tears
He waves at the old with his back to the wall
Giving the sad eye while in his mind
You're not adding straws to the pile
Maybe he'll give you a few more years
Placing the time glass on your stairs
From that day your life's caving in
Eyes of hate in a dream
Never seen so much blood
On my hands down the street
Piles higher than a mind can reach
Come to bed if it's hard to believe
Come to bed if it's hard to believe
Walk in ashes to the knees
Filth and dust in our hair
The smell of ruin is everywhere
Of anyone who comes close to our home
Count the dead if it's hard to believe
Count the dead if it's hard to believe
Day one there was light
Day two divided sky from the sea
Some things are written in the stars
As we were always meant to be
Come to bed if it's hard to believe
Come to bed if it's hard to believe
When you and I must part
And no one knows the inner grief
Of my poor aching heart
Just to see how I suffered for your sake
You are my love so dear
I wish your breast was made of glass
Your name in secret I would write
In letters of bright gold
Your name in secret I would write
Pray believe me when I say
That you're the one that I love best
And when you're on some distant shore
Think on your absent friend
And when the wind blows high and clear
A line or two pray send
And when the wind blows high and clear
Pray to send it love to me
That I shall know by your hand write
Father I know your pride
I will hold the light
When your eyes get weak
When your hands shake like the leaves
And bend like weed in the wind
I will turn the pages
Father I know the songs you loved
That I danced to as a child
In warm dark Spanish nights
I will paint the sky in the ceiling
And the sunset on the wall
Every gift you'll know
Feel it in your blood and your bone
I will turn the pages
I will hold the light
I will paint the sunset
We could say one day at a time makes it useless to try
Maybe this mountain is ours ahead a heavenly climb
A pile of ashes the wings of a moth drawn to the flame
Sooner or later you learn
Still it's a beautiful day
As long as I'm with you
I don't believe anything could taint the sky
We burn the fuse at both ends
Tell me how can I keep my baby safe
We could say one day at a time
Makes it all worth while
Still it's a beautiful day as long as I'm with you
I don't believe anything could
Keep our backs turned away from the grave
As long as I'm with you
I think I see you among the shadows
They still cling to the wall
And your mind feeds them
You're the victim of lack of meaning
Feeling sorry is your favorite feeling
Why am I supposed to excuse you
Nod my head as if I'm amused
Give me a reason to lay down my guns
Who said youth is only for the young
You shut out the light in your home
All that remains is the echo of laughter
Someone left it there a half lifetime ago
Why am I supposed to excuse you
Nod my head as if I'm amused
Give me a reason to lay down my guns
Why am I supposed to excuse you
Nod my head as if I'm amused
Give me a reason to lay down my guns
Who said youth is only for the young
Why am I supposed to excuse you
Nod my head as if I'm amused
Answers are so hard to find
If you're selling dreams
Wealth has only made you blind
The path back to beach
Is nowhere to be found
Caught between the ocean and the shoreline
She sleeps in silk on linen sheets
With a view of the ocean
Caressed by the breeze
She forgot why she came here in the first place
I did all I could do to forget
Somewhere in this world of broken spells
I'm gonna walk right in
I'm gonna call your name
I'm gonna make it right
Flakes of paint coming off the wall
Pictures of old friends hanging in the hall
I won't get to see you anymore
If I wait at the door
I'm gonna walk right in
I'm gonna call your name
I'm gonna make it right
Who needs a shoulder to cry on
We all need someone to rely on
They'll find a place the light is dim
They'll circle up and close you in
You have called upon the angels
Forgiving all their sins
Who never knew who to follow
All the tears you have swallowed
They'll find a place the light is dim
They'll circle up and close you in
You have called upon the angels
You have called upon each friend
You'll never call on them again
You'll find a place the light is dim
When they call upon the angels
The thoughts of the one
They care for the most
When their eyes are closed
That's my one promise
If you have someone else in mind
Don't shut out the light
If you have someone else in mind
Not like the first time
I'll get close enough
If you have someone else in mind
Don't shut out the light
If you have someone else in mind
Don't shut out the light
If you have someone else in mind
That's my one promise
We all have our ways to feel new again
In the corner of my eye
Even when your whole chest breaks
Along the mountain ledge
Even when you know everything will change
In the corner of my eye
Giving me her blessing
I knew this day would come
You'll always be the one
Casting light like the sun
Times when I was lost
Never once I lost faith in us
It's gonna take some time
We've only just begun
Woken by a fine summer rain
Let's meet again just as friends
Introduce ourselves with brand new names
I will always care for you
I will always care for you
I feel the pain on my skin
Burn right through and all the way in
This is a fight we just can't win
I will always care for you
I will always care for you
Somehow it confused me
Threw me off my feet to the ground
Then you lay on your back
Stripped of illusions
Read a new name in the stars
Maybe I waited for you
Maybe you waited for me
Everyone's waiting for someone to save them
Maybe I waited for you
Maybe you waited for me
Everyone's waiting for someone to break them
Maybe I waited for you
Maybe you waited for me
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Your every wish will be done
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
Guilty roads to an endless love
Your every wish will be done
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
How can it be you're asking me
To feel the things you never
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
We ran far away from the house we built
From one wild world into another
We ran from our lovers
Who we said had betrayed us
From one man's arms into another
We ran from our friends
Saying they're all the same
Sleepy days and live long
We're the future in a deck of cards
Said we're better on our own
The thoughts of the one
They care for the most
When their eyes are closed
That's my one promise
If you have someone else in mind
Don't shut out the light
If you have someone else in mind
Not like the first time
I'll get close enough
If you have someone else in mind
Don't shut out the light
If you have someone else in mind
Don't shut out the light
If you have someone else in mind
That's my one promise
Could this be the one
Just a moment in the sun
Chasing a few seconds of live
You're in every heartbeat
You're in every heartbeat
You're in every heartbeat
You're in every heartbeat
Could this be the one
Just a moment in the sun
Chasing a few seconds of live
You're in every heartbeat
You're in every heartbeat
You're in every heartbeat
Please let me in when you're singing your song
You've got the warmest place that I've ever found
And it would be the sweetest song that I have ever known
Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only hide the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I might have done
But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
When every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave them laughing when you go
Don't give yourself away
I've looked at love from both sides now
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
But now all my friends are acting strange
I've looked at life from both sides now
It's life's illusions I recall
I'll walk in the rain by your side
I'll cling to the warmth of your tiny hand
I'll do anything to help you understand
I'll love you more than anybody can
And the wind will whisper your name to me
Little birds will sing along in time
The leaves will bow down when you walk by
And morning bells will chime
I'll be there when you're feeling down
To kiss away the tears if you cry
I'll share with you all the happiness I've found
And the wind will whisper your name to me
Little birds will sing along in time
The leaves will bow down when you walk by
And morning bells will chime
And the wind will whisper your name to me
And my road it might be rough
But the better roads are waiting
And boys it ain't far off.
I walked down by the river
I turned my head up high.
My eyes they saw a better day
As I looked across the fields.
The road it might be rough
And boys He ain't far off.
As they gently walk across a lonely floor.
There goes the one of my dreams.
There goes my only possession.
There goes my everything.
I can see the happy years we had before.
There goes the one of my dreams.
There goes my only possession.
There goes my everything.
There goes the one of my dreams.
There goes my only possession.
There goes my everything.
There goes my only possession.
Other arms my tempt me
Don't let it worry you
I'll never be untrue.
Other arms my tempt me
Don't let it worry you
I'll never be untrue.
I can't believe that you're honestly thinking of leaving me
I'm drowning in tears drowning constantly nearer to misery
Over and over I practice every day
What to say when I see you
But when I see you my tears get in the way
I spend my nights making up things I might have to say to you
To stop you from going yet keep you from knowing how I feel
But till the light says goodbye to the night and your face I see
Over and over I practice every day
What to say when I see you
But when I see you my tears get in the way
I spend my nights making up things I might have to say to you
To stop you from going yet keep you from knowing how I feel
But till the light says goodbye to the night and your face I see
I wonder if they miss me while I'm gone
I wonder if they pray for the girl who went away
And left her dear old parents all alone.
You could hear the cattle lowing in the lane
You could see the fields of blue grass where I've roamed
You could almost hear them cry as they kissed their girl goodbye
Just a village and a homestead on the farm
And a mother's love to shield you from all harm
The sky's above are blue a sweetheart that loves you
A village and a homestead on the farm.
You could hear the cattle lowing in the lane
You could see the fields of blue grass where I've roamed
You could almost hear them cry as they kissed their girl goodbye
You could hear the cattle lowing in the lane
You could see the fields of blue grass where I've roamed
You could almost hear them cry as they kissed their girl goodbye
It's a long distance phone
It's a crime and a shame
That I ain't got the change
And don't you know that
I'm worried about him.
I've been all over street
It's just a face in the crowd
Where the traffic roars loud
But don't you know he'd be
Proud to give a helping hand.
For the times have been slow
I threw my pride out the door
But I'll keep trying.
Kind of hard to explain
But the feeling's the same
For the times have been slow
You put the change in my hand
You're the world's kindest man
You'll never know what you've done
For this poor mother's son
A thirsty man just got a
For the times have been slow
For the times have been slow
From dirty words and muddy cells your clothes are soiled and stained
But the dirty words and the mud of cells will soon be judged insane
So only stop and rest yourself and you'll be off again
Oh take off your thirsty boots
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
Then tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plains from field to town
And of the rusted prison gates that tumble by degree
Like laughing children one by one
They look like you and me
So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
I know you are no stranger down the crooked rainbow trial
From dancing cliff edge shattered sills to slander shackled jails
Yes all of this and more my friend your song shall not be failed
Oh take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting for its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers that will bloom again in spring
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's the thing that I can't win
Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break my heart again should I decide to stay
To that land of gentle breezes where the peaceful waters flow
Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
Ever since that first night
When I gave my love to you
Everything just seems so right
You are my sunlight shining through
And I've tried so not to let it show
Yet it seems sad because I know
No matter how hard I try
No matter how hard I try
It's always a goodbye
You smile softly as you leave my bed
And I tightly hold your hand
You lean down to kiss my head
But there's nothing to be said
And if you say you want to stay
I'd know you'd soon be on your way
No matter how hard we try
No matter how hard we try
It's always a goodbye
No matter how hard we try
No matter how hard we try
It's always a goodbye
To say what we really mean
So we make life a masquerade
Only the parts we play
No matter how hard we try
No matter how hard we try
You don't have to worry any more
You don't have to be afraid
We're gonna forget it
But we're gonna let it
Bring that bottle over here
We're gonna forget it
But we're gonna let it
Bring that bottle over here
I love all the things ya say and do.
You're gonna please me in every way.
I know it's gonna last a lifetime.
About the time I'm gonna be with you.
I love all the things ya say and do.
You're gonna please me in every way.
You're there to pick me up and help me to carry on.
I'm there to ease the pain and chase away the rain.
I love all the things ya say and do.
You're gonna please me in every way.
I love all the things ya say and do.
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
I just can't remember who to send it to
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
Won't you look down upon me Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
And I won't make it any other way
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you
Tell the man at the ticket stand
That you've changed your mind
Let me run on out and tell the cab
To keep his meter flying
You're gonna break my mind
Let me take your suitcase
Off the scales in time
Tell the man that you've suddenly developed
It's a long distance phone
It's a crime and a shame
That I ain't got the change
And don't you know that
I'm worried about him.
I've been all over street
It's just a face in the crowd
Where the traffic roars loud
But don't you know he'd be
Proud to give a helping hand.
For the times have been slow
I threw my pride out the door
But I'll keep trying.
Kind of hard to explain
But the feeling's the same
For the times have been slow
You put the change in my hand
You're the world's kindest man
You'll never know what you've done
For this poor mother's son
A thirsty man just got a
For the times have been slow
For the times have been slow
Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently
By putting your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee
Every time I look into the holy book I wanna tremble
When I read about the part where the carpenter cleared the temple
For the buyers and the sellers were no different fellers than what I profess to be
And it causes me shame to know I'm not the gal that I should be
Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently
By putting your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee
Momma taught me how to pray before I reached the age of seven
But he showed me enough of what it takes to get you through
Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently
Love is but a song we sing
And fear's the way we die
You can make the mountains ring
And you may not know why.
Some will come and some will go
And we shall surely pass
When the one that left us here
Returns for us at last
We are but a moments sunlight
If you hear the song I sing
You hold the key to love and fear
On your trembling hand
It's there at your command.
It's just where he's bound to be
And a monkey kinds of flashes on fruits and bananas
So he lives in the top of a tree
But my eyes are made for darkness
And so the nighttime is right for me
Now most folks they like the good day time
They like to see the shining sun
They're up in the morning
Till they're too tired for having fun
But when the sun goes down
And them bright light shine
My daytime has just begun
You're just about to drive me blind
You watch and you'll see
How my love light shines
Now there's two sides to this great big world
And one of them is always night
I guess you're gonna be alright
But don't come looking for string bean
Because my eyes they can't stand the light
I said sleep all day long
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow.
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white.
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
He's loaded lots of toys an goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
With a tail as big as a kite.
With a voice as big as the sea.
Let us bring him silver and gold.
Said the king to the people everywhere
Pray for peace people everywhere
Listen to what I say.
Sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar.
Following yonder star.
Guide us to thy perfect light.
Over us all to reign.
Guide us to thy perfect light.
Frankincense to offer have I.
Incense owns a Deity nigh.
Guide us to thy perfect light.
Breaths a life of gathering gloom.
Guide us to thy perfect light.
King and God and Sacrifice.
Sounds through the earth and skies.
All children young to stay.
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold.
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.
Still through the cloven skies they come
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world.
Above its sad and lowly plains
The blessed angels sing.
Yet with the woes of sin and strife
Beneath the heavenly strain have rolled
Two thousand years of wrong.
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow.
O rest beside the weary road
Shall come the time foretold.
When peace shall over all the earth
And the whole world give back the song
The prettiest picture you've ever seen
With all of the folks at home.
While cuddling under the mistletoe
Is one of the boys from home.
The door is always open
The neighbors pay a call
And Father John before he's gone
Will bless the house and all.
Of the jigs and reels.
I'm handing you no blarney
The likes you've never known
He was still a child.
He was still a child.
He was still a child.
Just a blessing and a little small talk.
There was no room no room at the Inn
Was no room no room at the Inn
When the time had surely come
For the Saviour to be born
There was no room no room at the Inn
Well according to the word
There was a virgin girl
She was trying to find a place
For the Saviour to be born
Was no room no room at the Inn
Was no room no room at the Inn
Was no room no room at the Inn
When the time had surely come
For the Saviour to be born
Was no room no room at the Inn
I know that mother was worried
Afraid to be delivered of her only son
She was very sad I know
When she had no place to go
Was no room no room at the Inn
Hey there was no room no room at the Inn
Was no room no room at the Inn
When the time had surely come
For the Saviour to be born
There was no room no room at the Inn
Bell boy and a poet waitress and a cook
Will be witness walking in heaven
To tell the thing they were doing
For she had no place to stay
There was no room no room at the Inn
Yeah there was no room no room at the Inn
Said there was no room no room at the Inn
When the time had surely come
For the Saviour to be born
Sweet little Jesus boy
They made you be born in a manger
Sweet little holy child
We didn't know who you were
Didn't know you'd come to save us Lord
To take our sins away
We didn't know who you were
Born in a manger Lord
Sweet little Jesus boy
The world treats you mean Lord
But that's how things are down here
We don't know who you are
Master you have shown us how
Even when you were dying
Just seems like we can't do right
Look how we treated you
But please Sir forgive us Lord
We didn't know it was you
Sweet little Jesus boy
Sweet little holy child
It takes time for all the answers to be dealt with properly
And everybody knows that it takes time
And everybody knows that it takes time
It takes time for all the answers to be dealt with properly
And everybody knows that it takes time
It don't seem long for happiness to give you peace of mind
And everybody knows that it takes time
It takes time for all the answers to be dealt with properly
And everybody knows that it takes time
It takes time for all the answers to be dealt with properly
It may depend on the way you see
And if there's anything that you want to be
We're the keepers of our focus
We're the keepers with the keys
We're the makers of all the confusion
We're the planters with the seeds
So burn the candles bright
And let the light dispel the dark
Turn our minds together
The world becomes a people's park
Can you imagine that my friends now
We're the keepers of our focus
We're the keepers with the keys
We're the makers of all the confusion
We're the planters with the seeds
So burn the candles bright
And let the light dispel the dark
Come turn our minds together
The world becomes a people's park
Can you imagine that my friends now
Burn the candles bright
And let the light dispel the dark
Come turn our minds together
The world becomes a people's park
Can you imagine that my friends now
And shall be one again
And few the ones with help to lend
Within the world of men
One day I walk in flowers
One day I walk on stones
Today I walk in hours
One day I shall be home
I've sat on the street corner
And cried out glad and cried out sad
With every voice but mine
One day I walk in flowers
One day I walk on stones
Today I walk in hours
One day I shall be home
And shall be one again
And few the ones with help to lend
Within the world of men
One day I walk in flowers
One day I walk on stones
Today I walk in hours
Although you see the world
Sometimes I can touch upon
The wonders that you see.
And pictures you've designed.
So glad you are a child of mine.
You know which way to go
I just want to watch you grow.
You're the one who taught me
You don't have to look behind.
So glad you are a child of mine.
Nobody's gonna kill your dreams
Or tell you how to live your life.
There'll always be people to make it hard for a while
But you'll change their heads when they see you smile.
The times you were born in
But you can make the times to come
I know you will be honest
So glad you are a child of mine.
Let me be the one to chase any clouds that appear
Let me be the one to hold you and tell you
Let me be the one when the day is done
To share your laugh and your lullaby wine
Like a star that you wish on
Let me be the one when the day is done
To share your laugh and your lullaby wine
It's a long long time till the end of time
Let me be the one when the day is done
To share your laugh and your lullaby wine
Let me be the one when the day is done
To share your laugh and your lullaby wine
It's a long long time till the end of time
Got a feeling in my heart
That it's time for us to start
Sing it high and sing it
Let's sing together again
It's your lucky day now
It's your lucky day now
When you think straight
And no matter what you may do
It's all coming right back to you
Got a feeling in my heart
That it's time for us to start
Sing it high and sing it
Sing it high and sing it
I see all the things you wanted
I see pain in your face
A stranger in my place
I can see now I was wrong
I can see where you might weaken
That time cannot erase
A stranger in my place
No one seems to know you quite like I do
No one knows the things
Looking back it seems
Where you might grow tired of dreams
Of the things I promised you
I can see now through
My tear filled eyes no love on your face
What do you get when you fall in love
A guy with a pin to burst you bubble
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again
Wat do you get when you kiss a guy
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again
That is why I'm here to remind you
What do you get when you fall in love
You only get lies and pain and sorrow
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again
That is why I am here to remind you
Wat do you get when you fall in love
You only get lies and pain and sorrow
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again
Now after all this time
You say you wanna throw our love away
Let's pack our troubles off to bed
Forget those awful things we said
We'll try to sleep instead
Without you by my side
The sun might never rise
The world won't be the same
All the birds that sing
I think I've seen the light
You know what's best for me
That kind of magic can't be taught
Talk it over in the morning
Without you by my side
The sun might fail to rise
The world won't be the same
All the birds that sing
Without you by my side
The sun might fail to rise
The world won't be the same
All the birds that sing
I'm at the railroad station in St. Paul
How are all the folks I'd love to see them
Ever since the train left Montreal
Thought I'd always love this life I'm living
But now I know I love you most of all
Many times before I know I swore that
That I'd come home to stay
But it always seems foolish
Dreams and trains got in my way
Tomorrow there'll be snow in Minnesota
But I won't around to watch it fall
I'll be headed for an old familiar station
Just hoping you still love me most of all
Boy you know I love you most of all
It's just where he's bound to be
And a monkey kinds of flashes on fruits and bananas
So he lives in the top of a tree
But my eyes are made for darkness
And so the nighttime is right for me
Now most folks they like the good day time
They like to see the shining sun
They're up in the morning
Till they're too tired for having fun
But when the sun goes down
And them bright light shine
My daytime has just begun
You're just about to drive me blind
You watch and you'll see
How my love light shines
Now there's two sides to this great big world
And one of them is always night
I guess you're gonna be alright
But don't come looking for string bean
Because my eyes they can't stand the light
I said sleep all day long
There's nothing I can do
It was in my destiny to fall for you
Me a love that's true
It was in my destiny to fall for you
And there ain't a thing I can do about it
You know I can't live without it
All I can say is hey hey hey
It was in my destiny to fall for you
Think I'm falling for you
There ain't a thing I can do about it
You know I can't live without it
All I can say is hey hey hey
It had to be somebody else for loving you more
Ain't no use in you crying now
After you have put me down
There ain't no use in me hanging around
I don't wanna be hurt anymore
Ain't no use in you crying now
After you have put me down
There ain't no use in me hanging around
And I don't wanna be hurt anymore
Ain't no use in you crying now
After you have put me down
There ain't no use in me hanging around
When you're down and troubled and you need some loving care
Close your eyes and think of me and soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name and you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
And I'll be there yes I will you've got a friend
If the sky above you grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door
You just call out my name and you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
You just call out my name and you know wherever I am
There's a house on a hill
By a worn down weathered old mill
In a valley below where the river winds
There's no such thing as bad times
And she wakes him up when the sun goes down
And the wheel of love goes round
He ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend
But then the wheels go round
And he makes his time worth while to then
Then he climbs back up again
And she rubs his feet while the sun goes down
And the wheel of love goes round
He ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend
But then the wheels go round
He ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend
But then the wheels go round
Wake up with no will to carry on
Sweet Jesus come and teach to me a song
For tomorrow we'll be dancing in the sun
To waste our lives while never loving
But you'll find in me you've got a friend
I never met the morning
Wake up with no will to carry on
Sweet Jesus come and teach to me a song
For tomorrow we'll be dancing in the sun
To waste our lives while never loving
So fly from stormy skies and kiss the sun
We've come a long way loving all we knew
I never met the morning
As they gently walk across a lonely floor.
There goes the one of my dreams.
There goes my only possession.
There goes my everything.
I can see the happy years we had before.
There goes the one of my dreams.
There goes my only possession.
There goes my everything.
There goes the one of my dreams.
There goes my only possession.
There goes my everything.
There goes my only possession.
You've got to get up every morning With a smile in your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
The people gonna treat you better
That you're beautiful as you feel
Mirrored in their faces I see frustration growing
You've got to get up every morning With a smile in your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
The people gonna treat you better
That you're beautiful as you feel
I have often asked myself for reason for sadness
You've got to get up every morning With a smile in your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
The people gonna treat you better
People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one
I think I'm gonna have a son
The sun is gonna shine above
And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
Love a guy who holds the world in a paper cup
Love him and he'll bring you luck
Try to earn what lovers own
And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
To listen for a while.
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes.
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
I felt all flushed with fever
I felt he found my letters
And read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on.
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
He sang as if he knew me
In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me
As if I wasn't there.
But he was there a stranger
Singing clear and loud
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Just because I ask a friend about him
Just because I spoke his name somewhere
Just because I rang his number by mistake today
He thinks I still care
Just because I haunt the same old places
Where the memory of him lingers everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy girl I used to be
He thinks I still care
And if he's happy thinking I still need him
Then let that silly notion bring him cheer
Just because I ask a friend about him
Just because I spoke his name somewhere
He thinks I still care
When your life's in trouble and you are all alone
When you feeling down and need some sympathy
And there's no one else around to keep you company
I'll be here to comfort you and see you through
Where ever you may wonder or where ever you may roam
You come back and I'll be waiting here for you
Please let me in when you're singing your song
You've got the warmest place that I've ever found
And it would be the sweetest song that I have ever known
It had to be somebody else for loving you more
Ain't no use in you crying now
After you have put me down
There ain't no use in me hanging around
I don't wanna be hurt anymore
Ain't no use in you crying now
After you have put me down
There ain't no use in me hanging around
And I don't wanna be hurt anymore
Ain't no use in you crying now
After you have put me down
There ain't no use in me hanging around
And shall be one again
And few the ones with help to lend
Within the world of men
One day I walk in flowers
One day I walk on stones
Today I walk in hours
One day I shall be home
I've sat on the street corner
And cried out glad and cried out sad
With every voice but mine
One day I walk in flowers
One day I walk on stones
Today I walk in hours
One day I shall be home
And shall be one again
And few the ones with help to lend
Within the world of men
One day I walk in flowers
One day I walk on stones
Today I walk in hours
Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently
By putting your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee
Every time I look into the holy book I wanna tremble
When I read about the part where the carpenter cleared the temple
For the buyers and the sellers were no different fellers than what I profess to be
And it causes me shame to know I'm not the gal that I should be
Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently
By putting your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee
Momma taught me how to pray before I reached the age of seven
But he showed me enough of what it takes to get you through
Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently
Every night I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms
Because I want a girl
So I don't have to dream alone
And a hand that I can hold
Through the years as I grow old
Because I want a girl
Someday I don't know how
I hope that you'll hear my plea
Someway I don't know how
She'll bring her love to me
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Until my lover's dream come true
Because I want a girl
So I don't have to dream alone
She'll bring her love to me
I'm going back to sleep and dream again
That's about the only thing I can do
Until my lover's dream come true
So I don't have to dream alone
So I don't have to dream alone
Papa's going to buy you a mockingbird
If that mockingbird don't sing
Papa gonna buy you a diamond ring
And if that diamond ring is brass
Papa going to buy you a looking glass
And if that looking glass gets broke
Papa going to buy you a billy goat
And if that billy goat won't pull
Papa going to buy you a cart and bull
And if that cart and bull turn over
Papa going to buy you a dog named Rover
And if that dog named Rover won't bark
Papa going to buy you a horse and cart
And if that horse and cart fall down
You'll still be the sweetest little baby in town
Sweet child and when you do dream
A dream to get you through the night
But lingers through the day
Tonight dreams are filled
For dreams always come true
Lullaby and good night
While your dreams fill your eyes
May the moonlight embrace you
The starlight caress you
May the sunlight still sing you
Got a good reason for
Taking the easy way out
Got a good reason for
Taking the easy way out
It took me so long to
He took me half the way there
He took me half the way there
It took me so long to
He only played one night stands
He only played one night stands
It took me so long to
One way ticket to ride
One way ticket to ride
You don't what you leave behind
You left my mind in an uproar
You don't see what you've done to me
You left my mind in an uproar
I could fight the clock
I go out walking to see that I've got
And I could fight the days
And say that I've got a million ways to spend my time
All I hear is a country song
They left my mind in an uproar
And I could fight the days
And say that I've got a million ways to spend my time
You don't what you've done to me
There's a wren in a willow wood
Flies so high and sings so good
And he brings to you what he sings to you
Like my brother the wren and I
I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
Northern Lights and skies ablaze
Silver wings in a fiery sky
Show the trail of my love and I
I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
Just one look and I fell so hard
I found out how good it feels
Just one look and I knew
That you were my only one
Just one look and I know
I built my world around you
And I need someone to help me
And that of late it's been my lot to be afraid
To remember you by anything
But memories I already keep
And I need some sympathy
It's harder when it takes so long to leave
The table where we all learned to laugh and learned to grieve
Over the pain that came so close to you
And it comes so close to me today
If you've been thinking you're all that you've got
Then don't feel alone anymore
Further and further from things that we've done
Leaving them one by one
Winding and swirling and dancing along
We pass by the old willow tree
Where lovers caress as they sing our song
Twisting together when we greet the sea.
Further and further from things that we've done
Leaving them one by one
Your life by his and help the boy
Teaching love and honesty
And being his own man handler
The son of a run of the mill run
Teaching love and honesty
And being his own man handler
The son of a run of the mill run
You can lose your head
There ain't no kingdom for the gambling man
You know the road now
And you've made your stand
When his eyes shine upon you
Teaching love and honesty
And being his own man handler
The son of a run of the mill run
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
I don't know why you should want to hide
But I can turn away if you won't see me
Time after time you refuse to even listen
Time after time you refuse to even listen
If I could be any tree in the ground
I'd wanna be a tree where the birds hang around
Send a little love my way
Every day begins with hope
No one ever need despair
If I could be any star up above
I'd wanna be a star people wish on for love
Show me that you want me
Show me that you need me
Send a little love my way
If I could be any star up above
I'd wanna be a star people wish on for love
Show me that you want me
Show me that you need me
I've been looking at people
And how they change with the times
And lately all I've been seeing are people
Throwing love away and losing their minds
Or maybe it's me that's gone crazy
All these lovers keep hurting each other
When good love is so hard to come by
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for
I've been listening to people
And they say love is the key
And it's not my way to let them lead me astray
It's only that I want to believe
Trying their best to survive
While in their hands is a dying romance
And they're not even trying to keep it alive
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for
And if love never lasts forever
I'd like to live out all my dreams
The nicest one would be with you
And you'd be here with me
Don't you ever get lonely
Lord I'm no good when you're away
But what do you expect
Who loves you like I love you
Won't you ever just get tired
And come on home to me
Don't you ever get lonely
That I can't do without
That dreams are all about
But you can't hold on to
Something that you never had before
Love waits for the wind
To bring you back again
Friends say it's great now you're a star
But what do they expect from a girl
Who loves you just the way you were
And you were here with me
Don't you ever get lonely
That I can't do without
That dreams are all about
But you can't hold on to
Something that you never had before
Love waits for the wind
To bring you back again
Every night I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms
Because I want a girl
So I don't have to dream alone
And a hand that I can hold
Through the years as I grow old
Because I want a girl
Someday I don't know how
I hope that you'll hear my plea
Someway I don't know how
She'll bring her love to me
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Until my lover's dream come true
Because I want a girl
So I don't have to dream alone
She'll bring her love to me
I'm going back to sleep and dream again
That's about the only thing I can do
Until my lover's dream come true
So I don't have to dream alone
So I don't have to dream alone
In the morning when I get up
I see your face in my coffee cup
Another morning in another day
Still I'm feeling the same old way
Should be it also easy to do
But I'm still getting over you
I can see an old friend of mine
Then I'll smile in the same in time
I'll be new in this new
Should be it also easy to do
But I'm still getting over you
Should be it also easy to do
But I'm still getting over you
I've never held love so closely
Never knew one touch so well
I never dreamed love could really
Bring me to heaven from hell
I've run miles in the rain
Faced the nights with no end
I finally found my way through
Was just to feel this love from you
Just to feel this love from you
I've never seen life so clearly
Never fear one step I take
My dreams live on past the morning
I'm sure God only knows
Where I'd be without you
I finally found my way through
Was just to feel this love from you
It's been hard to believe love was in reach
Forevers fell before each other's needs
God only knows where I'd be without you
I finally found my way through
Was just to feel this love from you
Tennessee Waltz by Anne Murray
When an old friend I happened to see
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember the night of the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
I told him to leave me alone
And a house built for two ain't a home
And I can no longer hear footsteps
From right down the hall
Here come the teardrops
He caught me lying then he caught a train
Then I caught a fever walking home in the rain
He's left me once and for all
Here come the teardrops
Here come the teardrops
There's no need to lie
It shows in your eyes
That you feel the same way I do
Let's keep it that way
And lying to him would hurt me more
Than leaving you this way
Let's keep it that way
Let's finish this wine
And the touch of your hand
Makes it so hard for me to tell wrong from right
He waits at home and he's there alone
And though I'd like to stay
Let's call it just friends
The love that we have
Unless you think about
But we don't make love anymore
Now it's hard to find
The feeling we shared
And we don't make love anymore
Beside me and talk to me
Touch me with your body and your mind
Help me find the feeling
And push all this behind
We'll just live our lives
We turn out the lights
We still lock the door
A chilling wind blows through the town
Autumn leaves seem gladly falling down
And I believe you'll be glad to see me go
Just when it was beginning to feel like home
Baby I'm so alone for another
So many things do fall through.
Still I don't pretend
That he's the friend that I'm used to.
And I blame myself for every cruel
And careless thing I do.
But I know he can't help but see.
For the pain I put him through
He can't hold me like you held me
He can't make me feel the same.
He's not the one to blame.
For the love he brings is true.
For the love he brings is true.
It's such a beautiful day that
Missed the dust off your shoes
Throw away ally our blues and start smiling
Take a good look around
There's no clouds looking down
Sunday sunrise shining
Through my windowpane
Chasing away my cares
With all the pouring rain
Unfolding like a smile
Making me feel just like
I keep knocking on wood
I hear birds everywhere
Singing songs in the air
Saying it's time to wake up
Get a whole new outlook
Sunday sunrise shining
Through my windowpane
Chasing away my cares
With all the pouring rain
Unfolding like a smile
Making me feel just like
Sunday sunrise shining
Through my windowpane
Chasing away my cares
With all the pouring rain
Unfolding like a smile
Making me feel just like
It's a long distance phone
It's a crime and a shame
That I ain't got the change
And don't you know that
I'm worried about him.
I've been all over street
It's just a face in the crowd
Where the traffic roars loud
But don't you know he'd be
Proud to give a helping hand.
For the times have been slow
I threw my pride out the door
But I'll keep trying.
Kind of hard to explain
But the feeling's the same
Find it in your heart
For the times have been slow
You put the change in my hand
You're the world's kindest man
You'll never know what you've done
For this poor mother's son
A thirsty man just got a
Find it in your heart
For the times have been slow
Find it in your heart
For the times have been slow
When trumpets were mellow
And every gal only had one fellow
No need to remember when
Waiter bring us some more Bacardi
We'll order now what they ordered then
Let's go backwards when forward fails
And movie stars you thought were long dead
Now framed beside your bed.
Don't throw the past away
You might need it some rainy day
Dreams can come true again
When everything old is new again.
Put it on backwards when forward fails
Leave Greta Garbo alone
Be a movie star on your own.
And don't throw the past away
You might need it some rainy day
Dreams can come true again
When everything old is new again.
Don't disturb the Lady Bug
Sleeping by the spider's web
And if you see a butterfly
Don't try to catch it in your net
To make this very special place
Open up your soul and mind
Feel the sunshine warm upon your face
You'll feel when it makes you smile
Like you're welcomed to the human race
Everybody sees a part
Of what this life can really be
No one sees like you can see
When you let your mind flow free
The wind is blowing through the trees
A song that everyone can learn
Feel the sunshine warm upon your face
You'll feel when it makes you smile
Like you're welcomed to the human race
Don't disturb the Lady Bug
Sleeping by the spider's web
And if you see a butterfly
Don't try to catch it in your net
When I heard you playing
Now you stole my heart away
Now you don't even notice me
So I just have to say now
Some ladies all around you
But I bet your feeling
Every evening playing
Instead of your ivories
I seem to concentrate
If I am ever gonna get
The chance to show you
All the floozy thoughts
Don't you know that it was
Just like me to syncopate
If I am ever gonna get
The chance to show you
All the floozy thoughts
Don't you know that it was
Just like me to syncopate
Every night I sit here by my window
Staring at the lonely avenue
Watching lovers holding hands and laughing
Like a walk in the park
What about the night we cried.
Memories are all I have to cling to
And heartaches are the friends I'm talking to.
When I'm not thinking of
Just how much I love you
Things we used to do.
Like a walk in the park
What about the night we cried.
Still can hear the jukebox softly playing
And the face I see it still belongs to you.
There's nobody else around
The things we used to do.
Like a walk in the park
What about the night we cried.
And heartaches are the friends I'm talking to
Sing a song sweet music man
You're a hell of a singer and a powerful man
But you surround yourself
With the people who demand so little of you
You touched my soul with your beautiful song
Then you changed the words and added
Then you sang a song you had written for me to someone new
Nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Nobody else can make me sing along
Nobody else can make me feel
The things are right when I know they're wrong
Nobody sings a love song quite like you
Sing a song sweet music man
That does for you what you ask them to
And you try to stay young but the songs you sung
To so many people they've all begun to come back on you
Nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Nobody else can make me sing along
Nobody else can make me feel
The things are right when I know they're wrong
Nobody sings a love song quite like you
Nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Nobody else can make me sing along
Nobody else can make me feel
The things are right when I know they're wrong
Oh she used to stand and clap her hands and sing Amazing Grace
While the tears of childhood innocence were streaming down her face
Mama prayed at night and raised her right and thought she knew her way
But it's a long long way from Sunday School to where she's at today
It's a long long way from Sunday School to Broadway
She's a long way from the girl she used to be
When you sing the city songs it's hard to find your way back home
Sunday evenings spent in the gospel tent down on her bended knee
Where she gave her soul to Jesus and he set her spirit free
But her body longed for city life and she couldn't stay at home
And it's a long long way from Sunday School to New York nights alone
It's a long long way from Sunday School to Broadway
She's a long way from the girl she used to be
When you sing the city songs it's hard to find your way back home
Then her eyes grew bright in the cool dark night and a halo framed her face
Did you see the man who took her life as she walked the New York streets
And it's a long long way from Broadway till the place at the Master's feet
It's a long long way from Sunday School to Broadway
She's a long way from the girl she used to be
When you sing the city songs it's hard to find your way back home
It's a long long way from Sunday School to Broadway
She's a long way from the girl she used to be
Look how the light in the morning lies
A million more is what you're hoping for
Or is it love what you had in mind
Follow the song of the Summer sun
Wander with me where you go
A million more is what I'm hoping for
Or is it love what we live to know
Where were you when you were young
Did you hide beside whoever tried to please you
Where were you when you were young
Did you have eyes just to ignore me
Or were you looking for me
How long before you believe me
The Summer sun still loves the rain
10 thousand times you may leave me
A million more is what I'm hoping
Or doesn't love bring you home again
A million more is what I'm hoping for
Don't it make life just a little more special
Knowing you've have someone who cares
You won't ever have to be lonely
You'll always have somebody there.
Don't it make everything a little bit easier
A hand to take you to the light
When it gets a little bit too dark to see.
You've got me to hold on to
Yes and don't it make every chance worth taking
Even when you try and fail
Don't it make all the pain worth aching
Look around and find somebody there.
Knowing that I'll always be
There to take you to the light
When it gets a little bit dark to see.
You've got me to hold on to
You know I'm gonna be right there
Anytime and anywhere.
You've got me to hold on to
You've got me to hold on to
Seems I really miss you after all
Time won't let me keep these sad thoughts to myself
And deep inside this heart of mine
and if you ever change your mind
Wish you'd never left me but love's a mystery
You can break a heart so easily
The days and the nights reveal how much I feel for you
Time has come for me to see
How much your love has meant to me
Deep inside this heart of mine
and if you ever change your mind
So I'll just watch the river rise
And deep inside this heart of mine
and if you ever change your mind
YOU KNOW IT'S SURE GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN
THERE'S NO NEED TO EXPLAIN WHERE YOU'RE BEEN
WHAT IS BEEN QUITE WHILE
THAT YOU CAN STILL LIKE THE ROOM WITH YOUR SMILE
YOU CAN HURT ME HOW YOU MET THAT I DON'T KNOW YOU ANYMORE
YOU'LL NEVER BE A STRANGER AT MY DOOR
I KNOW YOU WON'T STAND
WHAT IS SOMETHING YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY
LET'S JUST SHARE WHAT WE HAVE FOR TODAY
YOU CAN HURT ME HOW YOU MET THAT I DON'T KNOW YOU ANYMORE
YOU'LL NEVER BE A STRANGER AT MY DOOR
YOU KNOW IT'S SURE IS GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN
THERE'S NO NEED TO EXPLAIN WHERE YOU'RE BEEN
All the world is a room
And the room is painted blue
And we need our song to pull us through
And the words have slipped away
And we cannot sing our good old song
Like we could in the good old days
I think of the summer nights we knew
I remember the way you used to please me
But the time is now upon us to go our separate ways
Because we cannot sing the good old song
Like we could in the good old days
When the time is right
You will dance on the highest hill
But tonight I want to hold you close
I wanna feel you near me one more time
When your friends all come and ask you
Like we could in the good old days
How many times have you let me down
You never stay when you come around
I see no reason why you have to slip away
Come on in while I pour the wine
We'll drink it slow and take our time
You don't have to slip away
I like my feet right on the ground
I take a long time getting on to matters close at hand
Why don't you stick around
Why don't you why don't you stick around
I said now why don't you why don't you stick around
I see no reason why you have to slip away
The time is ours so we'll raise a glass
Here we are alone at last
I won't let you get away
I like my feet right on the ground
I take a long time getting on to matters close at hand
Why don't you stick around
Why don't you why don't you stick around
I said now why don't you why don't you stick around
Why don't you why don't you stick around
I said now why don't you why don't you stick around
I see no reason why you have to slip away
Why don't you why don't you stick around
I said now why don't you why don't you stick around
I see no reason why you have to slip away
Why don't you why don't you stick around
Every now and then I cry
All my friends say I'll survive
But I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again
That time won't heal a broken hearted me
Every day is just the same
They keep saying I'll survive
But I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again
That time won't heal a broken hearted
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But it rings and we rise wipe the sleep out of our eyes
The shaving razor's cold and it stings
Cheer up sleepy Jean Oh what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen
I once thought of you as a white knight on a steed
Now you know how happy we can be
Oh and our good times started then
With a dollar one to spend
I take my pen in hand
You'll have to understand
How is the weather there
Sharing a glass of wine
Somehow it just seems to suit me fine
Then who's going to keep you warm
You'll take the sun for granted love
We've seen a storm or two
We've seen a million drifters
These snowflakes and you
Oh that wintry feeling
There's no need to lie
It shows in your eyes
That you feel the same way I do
Let's keep it that way
And lying to him would hurt me more
Than leaving you this way
Let's keep it that way
Let's finish this wine
And the touch of your hand
Makes it so hard for me to tell wrong from right
He waits at home and he's there alone
And though I'd like to stay
Let's call it just friends
I want you to tell me why you walked out on me
I'm so lonesome every day
I want you to know that since you walked out on me
Nothing seems to be the same old way
Think about the love that burns within my heart for you
The good times we had before you went away on me
Walk right back to me this minute
I've never held love so closely
Never knew one touch so well
I never dreamed love could really
Bring me to heaven from hell
I've run miles in the rain
Faced the nights with no end
I finally found my way through
Was just to feel this love from you
Just to feel this love from you
I've never seen life so clearly
Never fear one step I take
My dreams live on past the morning
I'm sure God only knows
Where I'd be without you
I finally found my way through
Was just to feel this love from you
It's been hard to believe love was in reach
Forevers fell before each other's needs
God only knows where I'd be without you
I finally found my way through
Was just to feel this love from you
The love that we have
Unless you think about
But we don't make love anymore
Now it's hard to find
The feeling we shared
And we don't make love anymore
Beside me and talk to me
Touch me with your body and your mind
Help me find the feeling
And push all this behind
We'll just live our lives
We turn out the lights
We still lock the door
Well you know I'm really bad at writing letters
You know I'm not much better with the phone
Day after day goes by and I still think of you
Well I've been hearing that you've got a baby
And that you're happy with somebody new
You an I both know sometimes
These things don't work out right
That I still wish the very best for you
So don't you think because we're not together
That I won't wish the very best for you
Even though your love shines on some other
Baby I want you to know
That I still wish the very best for you
So love and be loved by another
You don't have to feel we're going to lose
You are free to roam and rediscover
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me
You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
You held my hand when it was cold
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me friend
You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
I'd like to live out all my dreams
The nicest one would be with you
And you'd be here with me
Don't you ever get lonely
Lord I'm no good when you're away
But what do you expect
Who loves you like I love you
Won't you ever just get tired
And come on home to me
Don't you ever get lonely
That I can't do without
That dreams are all about
But you can't hold on to
Something that you never had before
Love waits for the wind
To bring you back again
Friends say it's great now you're a star
But what do they expect from a girl
Who loves you just the way you were
And you were here with me
Don't you ever get lonely
That I can't do without
That dreams are all about
But you can't hold on to
Something that you never had before
Love waits for the wind
To bring you back again
I don't want to hear it
Let's let bygones be bygones
Let's think about tomorrow
You are the only one for me.
Tennessee Waltz by Anne Murray
When an old friend I happened to see
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember the night of the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Ever since that first night
When I gave my love to you
Everything just seems so right
You are my sunlight shining through
And I've tried so not to let it show
Yet it seems sad because I know.
No matter how hard I try
No matter how hard I try
It's always a goodbye.
You smile softly as you leave my bed
And I tightly hold your hand
You lean down to kiss my head
But there's nothing to be said
And if you say you want to stay
I'd know you'd soon be on your way.
No matter how hard we try
No matter how hard we try
It's always a goodbye.
No matter how hard we try
No matter how hard we try
It's always a goodbye.
To say what we really mean
So we make life a masquerade
No matter how hard we try
No matter how hard we try
And we'll find a little hide a way where we can love the whole night away
We'll be shadows in the moonlight right up till the light of day
You won't need a thing
Just bring your love for me
Do you want me to think
Just bring your love for me
You'll be glad you came
You don't drive a big black car.
And you don't look like a movie star
And on your money we won't get far.
To set my soul on fire.
You've got what it takes for me.
You don't live in a beautiful place.
And you don't dress with the best
And nature didn't give you such a
You've got what it takes
To set my soul on fire.
You've got what it takes for me.
My head goes around and round.
You don't live in a beautiful place.
And you don't dress with the best of
And nature didn't give you such a
You've got what it takes.
You've got what it takes
You've got what it takes
You've got what it takes
You've got what it takes
You've got what it takes
Just one touch and then it happens every time
The way I hold you and the night just seems to fly
Easy for you to take me to a star
Heaven is that moment when I look into your eyes
Just one touch and then it happens every time
Give it to a charity.
And give it to the poor.
And give it to the Salvation Army.
I don't think I need it any more.
Give it to a charity.
And give it to the poor.
And give it to the Salvation Army.
I don't think I need it any more.
This time there was no doubt.
I wear my heart upon my sleeve.
Now I guess I've worn it out.
Give it to a charity.
And give it to the poor.
And give it to the Salvation Army.
I don't think I need it any more.
Give it to a charity.
And give it to the poor.
And give it to the Salvation Army.
I don't think I need it any more.
Give it to a charity.
And give it to the poor.
And give it to the Salvation Army.
I don't think I need it any more.
The waitress works beneath
And they'll find that lately
At last has come to me.
And look up at the moon.
And wonder what those Mayans used to
So let's stay for a while.
And make those Mayans smile.
When I think how much I love you.
Seeing all that love coming back
For no reason at all.
I think of you and my head gets hazy
For no reason at all.
He doesn't know it's gone away
And I don't want to be set free.
You're a party with the lights down
Just hold me tight and don't let go.
And all too soon it fades away.
Now we'll travel with you
So many things do fall through.
Still I don't pretend
That he's the friend that I'm used to.
And I blame myself for every cruel
And careless thing I do.
But I know he can't help but see.
For the pain I put him through
He can't hold me like you held me
He can't make me feel the same.
He's not the one to blame.
For the love he brings is true.
For the love he brings is true.
Just a kiss at the end of an evening
When the lights are turned down low.
One kiss leads to another.
These are the things love is made of
It's late but there's no thought of
For tomorrow is so far away.
The night you found courage to tell
That you found out to tell him today
Some strange melody you never knew.
No matter what you do.
These are the things love is made of
Hearing giants footsteps when I never hear a sound.
But if there's dragons in this neighborhood then we're gonna leave.
You better come quick because there's a hippo in the bathtub
Are shining so bright
When there wasn't a star last night.
Stars are the windows of heaven where angels peep through.
Up in the sky they keep an eye
On kids like me and you.
Their teardrops are the rain.
But when we're good they are smiling
And they shine again.
Their teardrops are the rain.
But when we're good they are smiling
On every tree there sets a bird
Singing a song of love...
On every tree there sets a bird
And every one I ever heard
Could brake my heart without a word
Singing a song of love...
A song of love is a song of woe
Don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song
For I have loved and it's so
A song of love is a song of woe
Don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song
For I have loved and it's so
If you go down in the woods today
You're sure of a big surprise.
If you go down in the woods today
You'd better go in disguise
For every bear that ever there was
Today's the day the teddy bears have their picnic
Picnic time for teddy bears
The little teddy bears are having a lovely time today
And see them picnic on their holiday
See them gaily gad about.
They love to play and shout
They never have any care.
At six o'clock their mommies and daddies
Will take them home to bed
Because they're tired little teddy bears
Is sure of a treat today
And wonderful games to play
They'll hide and seek as long as they please
Picnic time for teddy bears
The little teddy bears are having a lovely time today
And see them picnic on their holiday
See them gaily gad about.
They love to play and shout
They never have any care.
At six o'clock their mommies and daddies
Will take them home to bed
Because they're tired little teddy bears
Got a feeling in my heart
That it's time for us to start
Sing it high and sing it
Let's sing together again
It's your lucky day now
It's your lucky day now
When you think straight
And no matter what you may do
It's all coming right back to you
Got a feeling in my heart
That it's time for us to start
Sing it high and sing it
Sing it high and sing it
Measuring the marigolds
How beautiful they are
Four and four are eight
Eight and eight are sixteen
Measuring the marigolds
You and your arithmetic
You'll probably go far
Four and four are eight
Eight and eight are sixteen
Measuring the marigolds
Seems to me you'd stop and see
I dreamed I held you in my arms
So I hung my head and cried.
Please don't take my sunshine away.
So let the sun shine in
So let the sun shine in
Open up your heart and let the sun shine in.
My mommy told me something
That little girls should know
It's all about the devil
And I've learned to hate him so
I know he'll be unhappy
Maybe if we keep on smiling
So let the sun shine in
So let the sun shine in
Open up your heart and let the sun shine in.
So let the sun shine in
So let the sun shine in
I can see all the obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
All of the bad feelings have disappeared
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
I see them bloom for me and you
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
Of all the places that you've never seen
You can walk and you can fly
Through the wobbles and over the sky
Now lay down your head
As if you're off to dreamland
You've got to get to bed
Move a tree or grow a flower
Build a castle just where ever you are
Make it all happen what ever you think
Just like magic you can do it in a wink
Now lay down your head
As if you're off to dreamland
You've got to get to bed
You can be what ever you want
As tall as a giant or as small as a ant
You're favorite hero will be your best friend
And anything you want is at your command
Now lay down your head
As if you're off to dreamland
You've got to get to bed
Now lay down your head
As if you're off to dreamland
You've got to get to bed
Now lay down your head
As if you're off to dreamland
Mama's going to buy you a mockingbird.
Mama's going to buy you a diamond ring.
Mama's going to buy you a looking glass.
Mama's going to buy you a billy goat.
Mama's going to buy you a cart and bull.
Mama's going to buy you a dog named Rover.
Mama's going to buy you a horse and cart.
You'll still be the sweetest little baby in town.
Dream a dream to drift you through
Tonight if dreams are few
I'll sing this lullaby for you
While your dreams fill your eyes
With a melody of love
The starlight caress you
May the sunlight still sing you this lullaby of love.
There must be thousands of people out there
Who search for love and find more than their share
They seem to fall into it naturally
But you know that doesn't apply to me.
The first time out take a chance on love and they win
And it turns out the same
I got that butterfly feeling inside
Now like all the rest you say goodbye
The first time out take a chance on love and they win
Though it turns out the same
Oh my heart aches impatiently
I love the look of what you're thinking
That's on fire as the sun is sinking.
As you spend the whole night
Making them come true
I have never had a dream
No one else I ever knew could touch me quite like you
Or say as much without a word
That holds more love than any song you've heard now.
As you spend the whole night
Making them come true
I have never had a dream
I have never had a dream
I've been looking at people
And how they change with the times
And lately all I've been seeing are people
Throwing love away and losing their minds
Or maybe it's me that's gone crazy
All these lovers keep hurting each other
When good love is so hard to come by
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for
I've been listening to people
And they say love is the key
And it's not my way to let them lead me astray
It's only that I want to believe
Trying their best to survive
While in their hands is a dying romance
And they're not even trying to keep it alive
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for
And if love never lasts forever
When you close your eyes to kiss her
When your arms reach out to hold her
When you tell her that you love her
Do the words come easily
Or do you find you pause
When you wake and you're beside her
When you plan your lives together
Does it feel like it should be
Or is something wrong
When you dream your dreams at night
Do you still see my face
Do you sleep sometimes
And call out my name by mistake
Do you sit like me and wonder
Living a love that won't end
When she tells you that she loves you
Do your eyes tear happily
Or do you find you cry
Or do you find you cry
Coming out in the sky
Tonight when my baby walks by
To the look in his eye.
And when your time comes for cards
With the other old men
When the old people look out their windows
I know they'll be happy to see
From the smile in our eyes
Real love hasn't died
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But it rings and we rise wipe the sleep out of our eyes
The shaving razor's cold and it stings
Cheer up sleepy Jean Oh what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen
I once thought of you as a white knight on a steed
Now you know how happy we can be
Oh and our good times started then
With a dollar one to spend
I don't wanna kiss or hold your hand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just wanna dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
Before this dance is through
I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see her face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
Before this dance is through
I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see her face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I'm happy just to dance
With their faces to the ground
They don't want no misery
And if you've seen enough already
There's a moon over Brooklyn
The war in Asia took a heavy toll
The price we paid was etched out in our souls
So come along with me
I'll show you where the city meets the sky
And if we should kiss and fall in love
It would be the right thing to do
There's a moon over Brooklyn
There's a moon over Brooklyn
There's a moon over Brooklyn
Maybe I'm right and maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak or maybe I'm strong
Somehow I know at a glance
The terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start then left
With a heart that is breaking.
Maybe I'll live a life of regret
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless I'm in love with you.
Somehow I know at a glance
Fine at the start then left
With a heart that is breaking.
Maybe I'll live a life of regret
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
A chilling wind blows through the town
Autumn leaves seem gladly falling down
And I believe you'll be glad to see me go
Just when it was beginning to feel like home
Baby I'm so alone for another
When the rooms are all in darkness
No one seems to live here anymore
Footsteps in the doorway
You know someone's waiting here for you.
When it's cold outside your window
And there's snow inside your shoes
And you're waiting out the cold December blues
You know someone's waiting here for you.
Somebody's waiting here for you
You know someone's waiting here for you.
Somebody's waiting here for you
You know someone's waiting here for you.
Somebody's waiting here for you
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Here to stay is a new bird
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
As we dream by the fire
Walking in a winter wonderland.
And pretend that he's a circus clown
Until the other kiddies knock him down.
Though your nose gets a chilling
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Dressed in holiday style
There's a feeling of Christmas.
Meeting smile after smile
It's Christmas time in the city
Soon it will be Christmas day.
Strings of street lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures.
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle
It's Christmas time in the city
Soon it will be Christmas day.
Of a place that I love
Even more than I usually do
I'll be home for Christmas
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree.
Christmas Eve will find me
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams.
Christmas time will find me
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams.
If I had my way this Christmas
If all I would wish could be
Of all the great wishes
I'd only ask for three
And if my first wish came true
There'd be peace on earth
Can you imagine a world like that
What a wonderful world it would be
And then I would wish
It could go on forever
For people like you and me
If I had my way this Christmas
And if the two others came true
My third wish would be
To share all my wishes with you
My third wish would be
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing.
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.
The little Lord Jesus asleep in the hay.
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
Close by me forever and love me I pray
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care
And take us to heaven to live with thee there.
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.
O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
O night when Christ was born
O night when Christ was born
Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born.
Down in a lonely manger the humble Christ was born
And God sent us salvation on that blessed Christmas morn.
Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born.
Behold through out the heavens there shone a holy light.
Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born.
Round yon virgin mother and child.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
The long night's begun
You said you'd never go
Blessed are the believers
They shall inherit a heartache
That was my greatest heartbreak
For their hearts shall one day mend
When loving those same sweet lies
Make us believers again
Sleep is a distant dream
Rolls round in my head
Something that you didn't mean
Blessed are the believers
They shall inherit a heartache
That was my greatest heartbreak
For their hearts shall one day mend
When loving those same sweet lies
Make us believers again
Blessed are the believers
They shall inherit a heartache
In the morning when I get up
I see your face in my coffee cup
Another morning in another day
Still I'm feeling the same old way
Should be it also easy to do
But I'm still getting over you
I can see an old friend of mine
Then I'll smile in the same in time
I'll be new in this new
Should be it also easy to do
But I'm still getting over you
Should be it also easy to do
But I'm still getting over you
For you my heart was always open
But you walked out and this loneliness came in
What I'd give to know the future now and then
If a heart must be broken why let the loving begin
For you a treasure became a token
I lost it all for a love that might have been
What I'd give to know the future now and then
If a heart must be broken why let the loving begin
They say the heart sometimes will cloud the mind
And nothing stands to reason when a love is blind
But the truth is always harder in the end
If a heart must be broken why let the loving begin
They say the heart sometimes will cloud the mind
And nothing stands to reason when a love is blind
But the truth is always harder in the end
If a heart must be broken why let the loving begin
What I'd give to know the future now and then
If a heart must be broken why let the loving begin
I told him to leave me alone
And a house built for two ain't a home
And I can no longer hear footsteps
From right down the hall
Here come the teardrops
He caught me lying then he caught a train
Then I caught a fever walking home in the rain
He's left me once and for all
Here come the teardrops
Here come the teardrops
It's really good you know
Those old feelings had died
Just one look in your eyes
And it's all I can do
To talk about the weather
To keep myself together
And it's all I can do
To smile and say I'm fine
To keep this heart from
To just stand here like this
That once held me so tight
And it's all I can do
To talk about the weather
To keep myself together
And it's all I can do
To smile and say I'm fine
To keep this heart from
So much that I wanna do
Tomorrow ain't really what it seems
So many days I've thought of you
It's about time you knew the truth
Why don't we fall in love
It takes such a load off to let you know
That you're the only one I never want to go
Think I never did know what to do
Why don't I just swallow each and every ounce of my pride
Everything you do I wanna feel again
Ain't no use for us to pretend
Tomorrow we're guaranteed love
The nights have been so lonely since you went away
Still it looks like another sleepless night
Only whets our appetite
This will be another sleepless night.
And it looks like another sleepless night
And it looks like another sleepless night
You've been moody and distracted
But I've never seen you like you are today
And I can't get inside you
I cannot get to where the secret lies
Past those shadows in your eyes.
Where do you go when you dream
And is there someone with you
Where do you go when you dream
Is the morning as beautiful there
As when you share a dream with me
But tell me how to bring you back
Should I be distant too
You know you can be honest
If there's something wrong then tell me so
Where do you go when you dream
And is there someone with you
Where do you go when you dream
Is the morning as beautiful there
As when you share a dream with me.
Where do you go when you dream
And is there someone with you
Where do you go when you dream
Is the morning as beautiful there
When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I'll fall in love with you
When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
And somebody stands there
With tears in their eyes
It's the same old scene
Somebody's always saying goodbye
And someone's left behind
How things got that way
Somebody's always saying goodbye
We could have had it all
Somebody's always saying goodbye
I want to know if you'll be my girl
I want to know if you'll be my girl
When I saw you walking down the street
I said that's a kind of girl I'd like to meet
I want to know if you'll be my girl
When you turned and walked away
That's when I want to say
I want to know if you'll be my girl
I want to know if you'll be my girl
When you turned and walked away
That's when I want to say
I want to know if you'll be my girl
I want to know if you'll be my girl
Out on the Mira on warm afternoons
Old men go fishing with black line and spoons
And if they catch nothing they never complain
I wish I was with them again
As boys in their boats call to girls on the shore
Teasing the ones that they really adores
And into the evening the courting begins
I wish I was with them again
Can you imagine a piece of the universe
I'll trade you ten of your cities
For Marion Bridge and the pleasure it brings
Out on the Mira on soft summer nights
Bonfires blaze to the children's delight
They dance round the flames singing songs with their friends
And I wish I was with them again
Can you imagine a piece of the universe
Can you imagine a piece...
I'm going to be with them again
Can you imagine a piece of the universe
Just close the door behind you
When you leave this place
You don't know my name
There's a feeling here
I wasn't prepared for
And I don't want to miss this dream
I've always played hard to get
There's a lot of lonely just outside my door
I want your love and I don't know why
Just doesn't work anymore
But I don't know what it means
And I don't want to miss this dream
There always was a ending
And no one could take my love a live
Some senator was squawking about the bad economy
It's gonna get worse you see we need a change in policy
There's a local paper rolled up in a rubber band
One more sad story's one more than I can stand
Not much to print today can't find nothing bad to say
Nobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town
We sure could use a little good news today
How I wanna hear the anchor man talk about a county fair
Nobody was assassinated in the whole Third World today
And in the streets of Ireland all the children had to do was play
And everybody loves everybody in the good old USA
We sure could use a little good news today
Nobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town
One good love that could even the score.
Give me one more chance to find the one that I've been looking for.
This time it took a little longer for my heart to heal
Longer to see that I could believe in you enough to try again
Even after all the evils you put me through
I still find myself coming back to you
Give me one more chance to find the one that I've been looking for.
Is a neat little package
They call me the girl
Who knows just what to say and do
I'm just another woman in love
A fire out of control
You touch me and I'm weak
I'm a feather in the wind
And I can't wait to feel you touching me again
Just another woman in love
And tremble like a child
I'm just what you make me
Can't wait till you take me
And set all my feelings free
Just another woman in love
A fire out of control
You touch me and I'm weak
I'm a feather in the wind
And I can't wait to feel you touching me again
Just another woman in love
Just another woman in love
A fire out of control
You touch me and I'm weak
I'm a feather in the wind
And I can't wait to feel you touching me again
Gotta make you love me the way you used to do
Gotta get back the feeling and put wind in my sails
There's one more thing I gotta do before I pack it in
Say the right thing to change your mind
Once I could catch your eye across the room
I've never been scared of love before now
But I've never been this much in love
With you it happened so fast that I'm afraid it won't last
And I don't wanna lose what my dreams are made of
I don't think I'm ready for you
There are too many heartaches I've already been through
But this feeling inside is getting harder to hide
Until I know that you feel it too
I don't think I'm ready for you
Right on the edge of out of control
Trying hard not to let what's in my heart show
I don't think I'm ready for you
And it wouldn't take much
Just three words with that touch of yours
I don't think I'm ready for you
And it wouldn't take much
Just three words with that touch of yours
I don't think I'm ready for you
You haven't heard the last of me
And I won't give up until you see
Oh you won't admit it
But your hearts got the upper hand
And I know that the time has come
To make you understand
That you haven't heard the last of me
I'm gonna play upon your sympathy
Till I get you back again
And I thought I'd ought to let you know
I'm never gonna let you go
Until I win and you give in
That you haven't heard the last of me
We turned our backs on true romance
And we never gave our love a chance
Oh it's so easy to let a lover slip away
And I know if I had the chance
I could make you stay
That you haven't heard the last of me
I'm gonna play upon your sympathy
Till I get you back again
And I thought I'd ought to let you know
I'm never gonna let you go
Until I win and you give in
That you haven't heard the last of me
And... So don't think I'd go without you
Knowing the way I feel my fate is sealed
This love of mine is real
That you haven't heard the last of me
I'm gonna play upon your sympathy
Till I get you back again
And I thought I'd ought to let you know
I'm never gonna let you go
Until I win and you give in
That you haven't heard the last of me
You haven't heard the last of me
I'm gonna play upon your sympathy
Till I get you back again
Love is glowing in your eyes.
That burns brighter every day.
And nobody loves me like you do
I could find no place to land.
Nobody loves me like you do.
Funny how life just falls in place somehow.
That I never even knew.
Nobody loves me like you do.
I was words without a tune.
I was a song still unsung.
A poem with no rhyme.
A dancer out of time.
Nobody loves me like you do.
Funny how life just falls in place somehow.
That I never even knew.
Nobody loves me like you do.
Or think that highly of me
I should know somehow
Still I believe somehow
But I should know by now
And I should see the light
But it's so hard to do
When all I see is you
And I should do what's right
This time you won't be leaving
A fool where you're concerned
A fool where you're concerned
I can't stand this feeling when you turn and look my way
Make my day then look away for someone better
And if I could I'd show you how it feels to be insane
I'd break your heart and put it back together
Love you out of your mind
Love you out of your mind
I would take you up to the top
Make you start all over
Love you out of your mind
Drag you down to that fine line
Never stop until I love you
Can't stand to leave but I know you can't stand to be alone
Look me in the eye and tell me you don't want me
Let me hold your hand and touch your heart and take you home
I will show you just what happens when you touch me
Love you out of your mind
Love you out of your mind
I would take you up to the top
Make you start all over
Love you out of your mind
Drag you down to that fine line
Never stop until I love you
Break your heart and put it back together
Love you out of your mind
Love you out of your mind
I would take you up to the top
Make you start all over
Love you out of your mind
Drag you down to that fine line
Never stop until I love you
Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love for ever
You're the one to take good care of my heart
So take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love for ever
You're the one to take good care of my heart
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love for ever
You're the one to take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love for ever
You're the one to take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby you're the first to take it
Up until now I've learned to live without love
I never knew how it felt to lose my control
Starting tonight we'll be together
I feel you inside my soul and I'm captured tonight
Starting tonight we'll be together
I feel you inside my soul and I'm captive tonight
Starting tonight we'll be together
Starting tonight we'll be together
And it's gonna be right.
Here we are with goodbye in our eyes
Running out of reasons to try
The leaves of change have fallen down
With both of us wondering why
You're all alone but still it seems
A thousand of miles apart
The sense of time has shifted now
And the end is beginning to start
Do you think we could change
Tell me who's leaving who
Is there anything left we can do
Can you tell me who's leaving who
Talk to me is there a chance
Of working it out heart to heart
When we get beyond our angry eyes
Before everything else falls apart
You think we could change
Tell me who's leaving who
Is there anything left we can do
Can you tell me who's leaving who
Tell me who's leaving who
Do you think we could change
Tell me who's leaving who
Is there anything left we can do
Can you tell me who's leaving who
Tell me who's leaving who
You think we could change
Tell me who's leaving who
The world was just a ball rolling around the sun
A million miles away from any other one
My life was just a dance where sometimes the music played
I held it in my hands till only the melody remained
And you were just a wish under a paper moon
A whisper on my lips that never could come true
But here you are with me and I'm like a child again
You set this prisoner free just when I thought I'd reached the end
Now when I look into your eyes I see
You were given as a gift to me
I know that you and I were meant to be together
If there's a Heaven shining up above
I wanna thank the one who let your love come shining through
Now I understand just what I'm living for
I can't remember how I ever did before
My heart is full of life I never knew was there
Now when I look into your eyes I see
You were given as a gift to me
I know that you and I were meant to be together
If there's a Heaven shining up above
I wanna thank the one who let your love come shining through
Now when I look into your eyes I see
You were given as a gift to me
I know that you and I were meant to be together
If there's a Heaven shining up above
I wanna thank the one who let your love come shining through
When the world was me and you
There's nothing we could to do
Now when I reach for you
Your touch is not saying
Tell me was it all again
When you call my name
Oh I came running to you
No one else can take the place of you
Tell me that this love is not a lie
How do I carry on when you're gone
When you kiss me there was a fire reaching deep in side the soul
Could it be that place my home you call my name
Where did we take the wrong turn
I'll be to be turned those times
When you're gone what do I do
No one else can take the place of you
Tell me that this love is not a lie
How do I carry on when you're gone
After you're gone what do I do
No one else can take the place of you
Tell me that this love is not a lie
How do I carry on when you're gone
When the world was me and you
Tell me how do I can be on when you're gone
You were never more strong girl
You were never more alone
You're flying on your own
You were never more happy girl
You were never oh so blue
You're flying on your own
And when you know the wings you ride
Can keep you in the sky
There isn't anyone holding back you
You reach out and you fly
There isn't anything that you can't do
You were never more wise girl
You were never more a fool
You're flying on your own
You were never more together
You were never more apart
You're flying on your own
And when you know the wings you ride
Can keep you in the sky
There isn't anyone holding back you
You reach out and you fly
There isn't anything that you can't do
When you know the wings you ride
Can keep you in the sky
There isn't anyone holding back you
You reach out and you fly
I could use a rainbow right about now
But human condition's gotten way out of hand
It's so hard to be just who I am
I could use some magic to break this spell
A rope or a ladder to climb out of this well
I'm so tired of changing to fit someone else's plans
I need someone who wants me as I am
So I won't have to hide behind some clever disguise
That only works for a while
I want someone who wants me as I am
Maybe on a sunny day without any clouds
A friendly face will step out of the crowd
My future companion who will meet me where I stand
Someone who wants me as I am
So I won't have to hide behind some clever disguise
That only works for a while
So if fate wants to give me one more chance
Stars are falling from your eyes
You don't feel what I feel inside
Your hand is warm but your heart is cold
How much longer can you go on
How much farther can we drift apart
Before all the feeling is gone.
Reminded me how good it was
Why can't it be like it used to be.
No matter how hard I try
I can't deny that look in your eyes
I watch you build invisible walls
When you believe that the world has lost its heart
No one can blame you for falling apart
When you can't see the light
When your tears blind your sight
Like a candle I'll show the way
When the truth's hard to find
When your heart cheats your mind
A lonely island apart from the crowd
When you can't see the light
When your tears blind your sight
Like a candle I'll show the way
When the truth's hard to find
When your heart cheats your mind
When you can't see the light
When your tears blind your sight
Like a candle I will show the way
When the truth's hard to find
When your heart cheats your mind
When the dream dies. I'll be your eyes
I never do get used to watching you go
We're standing in the echo of goodbye
The pain of separation never really goes away
And loneliness for love is one tough trade
Take this love I give you everywhere you go
Don't need to turn around and look for me
I never do get used to late night phone calls
Two sad voices trying to be strong
We both feel the hurt and hurt the same
Take this love I give you everywhere you go
Don't need to turn around and look for me
I know it's hard to see tomorrow
But when the distance and the night come closing in
Take it from my heart
Take this love I give you everywhere you go
Don't need to turn around and look for me
Gotta make you love me the way you used to do
Gotta get back the feeling and put wind in my sails
There's one more thing I gotta do before I pack it in
Say the right thing to change your mind
Once I could catch your eye across the room
Is a neat little package
They call me the girl
Who knows just what to say and do
I'm just another woman in love
A fire out of control
You touch me and I'm weak
I'm a feather in the wind
And I can't wait to feel you touching me again
Just another woman in love
And tremble like a child
I'm just what you make me
Can't wait till you take me
And set all my feelings free
Just another woman in love
A fire out of control
You touch me and I'm weak
I'm a feather in the wind
And I can't wait to feel you touching me again
Just another woman in love
Just another woman in love
A fire out of control
You touch me and I'm weak
I'm a feather in the wind
And I can't wait to feel you touching me again
Up until now I've learned to live without love
I never knew how it felt to lose my control
Starting tonight we'll be together
I feel you inside my soul and I'm captured tonight
Starting tonight we'll be together
I feel you inside my soul and I'm captive tonight
Starting tonight we'll be together
Starting tonight we'll be together
And it's gonna be right.
The stars are so close we could touch them
The light is soft and still
The world has stopped turning outside our door
Your kiss is all that's real
And it's just like the first time when I touch you
So it's only fair to lay it on the line.
But if I ever fall in love again
Sometime when this broken heart can mend.
If I ever fall in love again.
In your arms I feel I'm ready now to try.
So if I ever fall in love again
Sometime when this broken heart can mend.
If I ever fall in love again.
I'd be a fool to ever let you go.
And feels like there's never know.
How to your lips and we kiss you and I in the pure clouds.
If I ever fall in love again
Some senator was squawking about the bad economy
It's gonna get worse you see we need a change in policy
There's a local paper rolled up in a rubber band
One more sad story's one more than I can stand
Not much to print today can't find nothing bad to say
Nobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town
We sure could use a little good news today
How I wanna hear the anchor man talk about a county fair
Nobody was assassinated in the whole Third World today
And in the streets of Ireland all the children had to do was play
And everybody loves everybody in the good old USA
We sure could use a little good news today
Nobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town
Yes it's true I have a gift of sometimes acting special
Wearing my facade for all to see
Showing what I really think of me
It's hard for me to understand how you could ever love me
Sometimes I don't like myself at all
I don't see how I'm worthy of you thinking so much of me
But you're always here to hold me when I fall
You're always here to wipe away my tears
You're always here to hold me when I fall
The kind of love you've shown me is deserving of much better
Than anything I've given in return
Faith in you is one thing I have learned
It's hard for me to understand how you could ever love me
Sometimes I don't like myself at all
I don't see how I'm worthy of you thinking so much of me
But you're always here to hold me when I fall
You're always here to hold me when I fall
The nights have been so lonely since you went away
Still it looks like another sleepless night
Only whets our appetite
This will be another sleepless night.
And it looks like another sleepless night
And it looks like another sleepless night
The long night's begun
You said you'd never go
Blessed are the believers
They shall inherit a heartache
That was my greatest heartbreak
For their hearts shall one day mend
When loving those same sweet lies
Make us believers again
Sleep is a distant dream
Rolls round in my head
Something that you didn't mean
Blessed are the believers
They shall inherit a heartache
That was my greatest heartbreak
For their hearts shall one day mend
When loving those same sweet lies
Make us believers again
Blessed are the believers
They shall inherit a heartache
Love is glowing in your eyes.
That burns brighter every day.
And nobody loves me like you do
I could find no place to land.
Nobody loves me like you do.
Funny how life just falls in place somehow.
That I never even knew.
Nobody loves me like you do.
I was words without a tune.
I was a song still unsung.
A poem with no rhyme.
A dancer out of time.
Nobody loves me like you do.
Funny how life just falls in place somehow.
That I never even knew.
Nobody loves me like you do.
I can hear the cars out on the street
As I lie awake and watch you while you sleep
It seems that it was only yesterday
When you took my hand and carried me away
Now everyday I look at you
And think of when you married me
Our children are the garden we have grown
I see so much of you in them I know
This house is filled with memories of the past
Now everyday I look at you
And think of when you married me
Now after all this time we've been together
I know you said you'd stay with me forever
I just can't believe your love would last so long
So now I think I'll put my fears away
If not for love you never would have stayed
Forgive me if I feel this way again
But I need to know you love me now and then
Cause everyday I look at you
And think of when you married me
In the corner of your eye
What kind of game this we're playing
Shadow's in the night
Trying to make it right
The silence is so loud
I can't hear the words we're saying
Anyone can do the heartbreak
Everybody knows the dance
To kill a true romance
Anyone can do the heartbreak
Anyone can make love end
It's gonna take a little pain
Some fire and some rain
To bring it back again.
You think you're going to fall
All you want to do is fly
We're up against the wall
So look into my heart
Tell me can't you see
When I hold you in my arms
We can hear the music play.
Anyone can do the heartbreak
Everybody knows the dance
To kill a true romance
Anyone can do the heartbreak
Anyone can make love end
It's gonna take a little pain
Some fire and some rain
To bring it back again.
And it's one step forward
But we're only losing ground
Anyone can do the heartbreak
Everybody knows the dance
To kill a true romance
Anyone can do the heartbreak
Anyone can make love end
It's gonna take a little pain
Some fire and some rain
To bring it back again.
Anyone can do the heartbreak
Everybody knows the dance
Both of us know the dangers
Far across the ocean in the darkest night
I was sailing on the ship of fools
But looking in your eyes I see the harbor lights
Now I just want to stay with you
Understand what I need
And love me as if you've always loved me
Till the morning light
You're the perfect stranger tonight
Far across the ocean in the darkest night
I was sailing on the ship of fools
But looking in your eyes I see the harbor lights
Now I just want to stay with you
Understand what I need
And love me as if you've always loved me
Till the morning light
At least half of those parts have been broken in two
Sometimes love just ain't strong enough
Take me to where it's safe and warm
People take love for a foolish thing
And I'd like to think
Take me to where it's safe and warm
Take me to where it's safe and warm
Just a little longer tonight.
I know how hard he'll take it
When he finds out I can't stay
So I don't want to have to tell him
If there's any other way
Where hearts are never broken
Where no one's ever hurt in anger
And harsh words are never spoken
Now it only stands to reason
With all the plans that mix
On a better way than this
Where tears are never needed
Where no one ever need surrender
And neither side's mistreated
Where hearts are never broken
Where no one's ever hurt in anger
And harsh words are never spoken
Where tears are never needed
Where no one ever need surrender
And neither side's mistreated
I can be high as a bluebird flies if you'd love me
A mountain of love and the clear sky above me are all I'd see
Oceans and valleys and canyons and streams
So far below a river of dreams keeps haunting me
I could be high as a bluebird flies and never tell lies
I could be strong as a river is long if you'd love me
Sweet harmony pouring all over me like a waterfall
I could be everything money can't buy
I could be high as a bluebird flies and never tell lies
You're an angel from heaven sent down from above
I could be high as a bluebird flies and never tell lies
I know this feeling from somewhere
I know I've been here before
The one I love forever
Doesn't love me anymore
Wrong end of the rainbow again
I was looking for true love
Before I tied all my heartstrings
Wrong end of the rainbow again
Between the winning and the losing
There's a very fine line
This time I felt like a winner
When I was losing all the time
I get this rainy day feeling
That I'm gonna be blue
I thought the day that I found him
I'd seen the last of you
Wrong end of the rainbow again
Wrong end of the rainbow again
It might be only one to agree
It's getting colder in this room
We just don't seem to care to touch
We just don't want to share that much
We've got to feed this fire
We've got to fan this flame
If this love burns out
We've got ourselves to blame
We've got to stoke these coal
Until they glow red hot
We've got to feed this fire
With everything we've got
Back when our cold and hungry hearts
To never let this fire die
Until these hearts have turned to ashes
We've got to feed this fire
We've got to fan this flame
If this love burns out
We've got ourselves to blame
We've got to stoke these coal
Until they glow red hot
We've got to feed this fire
With everything we've got
We've got to feed this fire
We've got to fan this flame
If this love burns out
We've got ourselves to blame
We've got to stoke these coal
Until they glow red hot
We've got to feed this fire
With everything we've got
We've got to feed this fire
Used to be more careful with our words
Tender with our love that's how it was at first
But time can do a number on a heart
I guess that's why so many fall apart
We're a little less than perfect
That should come as no surprise
But it's easy to forget it
When the stars are in your eyes
But we pick each other up if we should fall
A little short of love
A little short of love
I look at you and I remember when
We're a little less than perfect
That should come as no surprise
But it's easy to forget it
When the stars are in your eyes
But we pick each other up if we should fall
A little short of love
A little short of love
The moon was a thin slice of silver
Sailing the dark southern skies
An old flame still burned in my memory
Long after we said goodbye
They say love can rise from the ashes
If the moon and the moment are right
But I never dreamed it could happen
Till I ran into you tonight
A new moon is shining an old flame is burning
Whirling around us weaving it's magic
A new moon an old flame and you
We laughed and we talked about old times
What we'd been doing since then
As time passed you moved ever closer
And I felt those feelings again
I wondered where all this was leading
Till the moment we touched and I knew
Love was still there and just waiting
For a new moon an old flame and you
There's a natural wonder between us
But it doesn't seem natural to me
That you can walk away from the love we made
And leave everything that we worked for
To start a brand new life
I saw you drive across the Memphis bridge
But I don't believe my eyes
I can see the cotton fields on the other side
And the sun going down again
But I still don't see
Why the love we had should end
If it proved how much I love you
I'd bet my soul against the undertow
For the chance to hold you tight
But there's more than a river between us
And I can't swim that far
And as hard as I try I just can't drown
The memories of where you are
I can see the cotton fields on the other side
And the sun going down again
But I still don't see
I used to think I was tied to a heartache
Even the nights are better now that we're here together
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside ya
Even the nights are better since I found you
And you showed me how to ease the pain
And you did more than mend a broken heart
And I can see that you feel the same way
I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside ya
Flying down the street on my American Ace
Testing my freedom from that day on
That bike you gave me was one of my favorite things
That day I discovered you'd given me roots and wings
Holding me strong and lifting me up
Child of the earth and a rider of the wind
A dreamer of dreams caught in between roots and wings
You weren't standing in my way when I was 18
Letting your heart break and letting me leave
Knowing you'd be waiting at the end of that road
Sometimes you've doubted the wisdom of my foolish dreams
You never once denied me my roots and wings
Holding me strong and lifting me up
Child of the earth and a rider of the wind
A dreamer of dreams caught in between roots and wings
Now part of me wants to stay close to the ground
And part of me wants to never come down
Holding me strong and lifting me up
Child of the earth and a rider of the wind
Sometimes I know how the melody goes
But I don't know the words to the song
Some days go by not a cloud in the sky
And some days it rains all night long
Sometimes it seems like it's just you and me
And nothing could ever go wrong
But love is so strange sometimes it stays
And some days it rains all night long
Sometimes our best isn't all it could be
And sometimes we don't even try
But somehow or other we find what we need
To keep us from saying goodbye
Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's sad
Somehow we keep hanging on
Waiting for rainbows that follow the storm
And some days it rains all night long
Flying down the street on my American Ace
Testing my freedom from that day on
That bike you gave me was one of my favorite things
That day I discovered you'd given me roots and wings.
Holding me strong and lifting me up
Child of the earth and a rider of the wind
A dreamer of dreams caught in between roots and wings.
You weren't standing in my way when I was 18
Letting your heart break and letting me leave

Holding me strong and lifting me up
Child of the earth and a rider of the wind
A dreamer of dreams caught in between roots and wings.
Now part of me wants to stay close to the ground
And part of me wants to never come down.
Holding me strong and lifting me up
Child of the earth and a rider of the wind
I know this feeling from somewhere
I know I've been here before
The one I love forever
Doesn't love me anymore
Wrong end of the rainbow again

Wrong end of the rainbow again
Wrong end of the rainbow again
If you're fond of sand dunes and salty air
Quaint little villages here and there
You're sure to fall in love with old Cape Cod.
If you like the taste of a lobster stew
Served by a window with an ocean view
You're sure to fall in love with old Cape Cod.
Winding roads that seem to beckon you
Miles of green beneath a sky of blue
Remind you of the town where you were born.
If you spend an evening you'll want to stay
Watching the moonlight on Cape Cod Bay
You're sure to fall in love with old Cape Cod.
If you spend an evening you'll want to stay
Watching the moonlight on Cape Cod Bay
You're sure to fall in love with old Cape Cod.
You're sure to fall in love
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind
In a lonely shack by a railroad track
He spent his younger days
Made him a slave to his wandering ways
And the wayward wind is a restless wind
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind
He vowed we'd never part
Though he tried his best to settle down
I'm now alone with a broken heart
And the wayward wind is a restless wind
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin
Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free
So I told the friendly star
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you
Now I should it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear.
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever all through the night.
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago.
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right.
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever all through the night.
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
Fever with the flaming youth
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade.
They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn.
What a lovely way to burn.
Or I'll never fall in love
Love is ended before it's begun
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
Or I'll never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
To help me find romance tonight
So shine ... shine ... shine
Can lead the way to golden dreams
So shine ... shine ... shine
The magic of your lamp of love
Please see what you can do
For me ... and for my one and only love
The magic of your lamp of love
Please see what you can do
See the pyramids along the Nile
Watch the sunrise on a tropic isle
See the marketplace in old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
A new moon moves at last alone
Feeling far above her
So on and on it will always be
For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothing to do
But to give to you and to give to me
For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothing to do
But to give you and to give to me
The midnight hours come slowly creeping when there's no one
There must be more to life than sleeping single in a bed for
Now you say you're lonely
You cried the long night through
I cried a river over you.
Now you say you're sorry
I cried a river over you
Nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
I remember all that you said
Told me love was to plebeian
Told me you were through with me and
Now you say you love me
Come on and cry me a river
I cried a river over you.
Nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
I remember all that you said
Told me love was to plebeian
Told me you were through with me and
Now you say you love me
Come on and cry me a river
I cried a river over you.
Take me in your arms and never let me go
Whisper to me softly while the moon is low
Hold me close and tell me what I wanna know
Kiss me once again before we say goodnight
Take me in your loving arms and squeeze me tight
Put me in a mood so I can dream all night
Everybody's sleeping so it's quite all right
Chills run up my spine
I won't be happy till you're mine
When I'm in your arms you give my heart a treat
Everything about you is so doggone sweet
Every time we kiss you make my life complete
When I'm in your arms you give my heart a treat
Everything about you is so doggone sweet
Every time we kiss you make my life complete
You with the stars in your eyes
Love's never made a fool of you
You used to be too wise.
Though she won't throw a crumb to you
You think someday she'll come to you.
Her with her nose in the air
She's got you dancing on a string
Break it and she won't care
Won't you take this advice
I hand you like a brother
Is it all going in one ear
Won't you take this advice
I hand you like a brother
Is it all going in one ear
It only hurts for a little while that's what they tell me that's what they say
It only hurts for a little while then all your heartaches will pass away
It's so easy to be smart with somebody else's heart
But I don't know how to start forgetting you what can I do
It only hurts for a little while that's what they tell me just wait and see
But I will hurt till you come back to me
It only hurts for a little while that's what they tell me just wait and see
And held me closely then stole my heart
Who gave no warning we'd ever part.
He was last seen hiding out in someone's arms
He knew nothing of the danger in his charms
A jury may find him guilty but I'd forgive him if I could see
A signed confession that he'd repented and really wanted no one but me.
And held me closely then stole my heart
Who gave no warning we'd ever part.
He was last seen hiding out in someone's arms
He knew nothing of the danger in his charms
A jury may find him guilty but I'd forgive him if I could see
How many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
But I really don't want to know
How many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow
But I really don't want to know
So always make me wonder
And even if I ask you
Just let it remain your secret
The New Year's Eve we did the town
The day we tore the goal post down
We will have these moments to remember
The ballroom prize we almost won
We will have these moments to remember
Though summer turns to winter
And the present disappears
The laughter we were glad to share
Will echo through the years
When other nights and other days
May find us gone our separate ways
We will have these moments to remember
We will have these moments to remember
Though summer turns to winter
And the present disappears
The laughter we were glad to share
Will echo through the years
When other nights and other days
May find us gone our separate ways
All children young to stay.
All children young to stay.
All children young to stay.
I remember the snowflakes that fell from the sky
And covered the village that lay sleeping below
Thank goodness this season will never grow old.
I look through my window well into the night
Watching and waiting and hoping I might
See one little reindeer fly through the snow
Thank goodness this season will never grow old.
And the spirit be with you wherever you go.
And the spirit be with you wherever you go.
Trees with full branches were the first ones to go
I remember the children who came to the door
And sang out the carols we all used to know
Thank goodness this season will never grow old.
The ones who lie waiting for good things you know
Thank goodness this season will never grow old.
Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible says
Was born on Christmas Day.
New King's born today
And man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas day.
While shepherds watched their flocks by night
They saw a bright new shining star
And heard a choir from heaven sing
The music came from afar.
New King's born today
And man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas day.
Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her Child
Not a single room was in sight.
By and by they found a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little Boy Child was born.
Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen to what they say
That man will live forevermore
And the tie that binds
Then they start flowing
Then it won't be long
I'm talking about love
That's the way it goes
And it starts growing
I'm talking about love
That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
Until you take a mile
Even when they are showing
Then it won't take long
I'm talking about love
That's the way it goes
I'm talking about love
That's the way it goes
I'm talking about love
That's the way it goes
I'm talking about love
That's What My Love Is For
As performed by Anne Murray and Aaron Neville
That's what my love is for.
If you get tired of all the games that other lovers play
In the name of love just waging war.
That's what my love is for.
These arms are gonna hold you every night so faithfully.
These eyes are gonna see you unconditionally.
This body and soul are nobody's but yours.
This heart bears your name forever more.
That's what my love is for.
That's what my love is for.
These arms are gonna hold you every night so faithfully.
These eyes are gonna see you unconditionally.
This body and soul are nobody's but yours.
This heart bears your name forever more.
True love asks no questions.
True love tells no lies.
True love is its own reward.
That's what my love is for.
That's what my love is for.
Bryan Adams and Anne Murray
And words are just a waste of time
We could get right to it
If I could only read your mind.
You're just a mystery to me
Deeper than the deep blue sea
There must be something that will melt your heart
What would it take to get you closer
What would it take just to stir your soul
What can I do to make you love me
Just the thought of you
Tell me what would it take.
If the night don't move you
And you've never seen the stars come out
If the touch don't soothe you
Then maybe you've just never been touched
I wanna be the one to change your mind
I think about it all the time.
I wanna wake you from your deepest sleep.
You're just a mystery to me
Deeper than the deep blue sea
There must be something that will melt your heart
Baby tell me just where to start.
What would it take to get you closer
What would it take just to stir your soul
What can I do to make you love me
Just the thought of you
Tell me what would it take.
What would it take to get you closer
What would it take just to stir your soul
What can I do to make you love me
Just the thought of you
Tell me what would it take.
Tell me what would it take.
Tell me what would it take.
Tell me what would it take.
Tell me what would it take.
Tell me what would it take.
I don't want to hear it
Let's let bygones be bygones
Let's think about tomorrow
You are the only one for me
I look at this mountain
I can't help but wonder
Where's the other side
I've got to be honest
These tears are asking me
Darling please tell me something
Won't you make me feel that it's all right
When this trouble passes over
You and I will walk away
Knowing that our love survived
Another test of faith
You and I can walk on water
It may not look that way right now but
Trust me baby this is love
When a heart is uncertain
It's bound to second guess
So hold me close until tomorrow
What if there's no life line and you're sinking or lost
But the mountains standing in the way are only in our minds
And the risk of going nowhere is the greatest risk of all
So just listen to the voice that says
On the other side of doubt is faith
On the other side of pain lies strength
The journey may seem endless when you know the road is rough
But on the other side of fear is love.
For such a long time I put my dreams aside
The tides of change felt dangerous
The mountains seemed too high
But my dreams were slowly fading as time went quickly by
So I held me breath with every step never knowing I would find.
On the other side of doubt is faith
On the other side of pain lies strength
The journey may seem endless and you know the road is rough
But on the other side of fear is love.
On the other side of doubt is faith
On the other side of pain lies strength
The journey may seem endless and you know the road is rough
Every little thing you were doing to me
But I let you be cruel
I wasn't just another fool you were using
You can't break this heart
You ain't gonna hear me crying the blues
Love's the kind of game where both sides
Share the blame for losing
Shame on you for driving me mad
I let your misery keep me company
My poor heart's got a checkered past
I'm still searching for a love that will last
I want someone true and steady
Some times I even let myself get hurt
But I'll take another chance
Cause every new romance is thrilling
Shame on you for driving me mad
I let your misery keep me company
You'd like to think you broke my heart in two
You'd like to think that I'll never get over you
Shame on you for driving me mad
A fool for love sees what she wants to see
Oh you'll cry when some leave before their time
But you'll keep a little something that they left behind
And you will feel good again
You'll come across one you forgot every once in awhile
That makes you feel good again
Each and every moment floats away in the wind
Oh you'll cry when some leave before their time
You can dance every dance with the guy
And in whose arms you're gonna be
Laugh and sing but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone
And in whose arms you're gonna be
I love you oh so much
Till the night is gone
If he asks if you're all alone
And in whose arms you're gonna be
Save the last dance for me
How do you block the sound
By the time you drove me home
By the chill in your embrace
How do you teach your heart
It's probably ancient history
I'm one of the chosen few
Who went ahead and fell for you
I fell too fast I feel too much
How to be insensitive
By the time you drove me home
By the chill in your embrace
Lord. I hope this day is good
I'm feeling empty like you know I would
I should be thankful Lord I know I should
But Lord I hope this day is good
Lord have you forgotten me
I've been praying to you faithfully
I'm not saying I've done all I can
But Lord I know you'd understand
I don't need fortune and I don't need fame
Send in the thunder Lord send down the rain
But when your planning just how it will be
Plan a good day for me
All that I'm asking is a little less crying
It might be hard for the devil to do
That saved a wretch like me.
And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.
And grace will lead me home.
The Lord has promised good to me
As long as life endures.
A life of joy and peace.
When we've been there ten thousand years
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Sometimes there are lives
We all have pain we all have sorrow
We know that there's always tomorrow
Lean on me when you're not strong
For it won't be long till I'm gonna meet
Please swallow your pride
If I have faith you need to borrow
For no one can feel those of your needs
That you won't let show
Just call on me brother when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on
Lean on me when you're not strong
For it won't be long till I'm gonna meet
Just call on me brother when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on
If there is a load you have to bear
I'm right up the root and I'll share your load
Call me if you need me
Call me when you want me
Call me if you need me
Call me when you want me
There will be an answer. let it be.
There will be an answer. let it be.
There will be an answer. let it be.
Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
Watching for you and for me
Ye who are weary come home
Pleading for you and for me
Mercies for you and for me
Ye who are weary come home
Promised for you and for me
Pardon for you and for me
Ye who are weary come home
Every life has a plan
Though sometimes the map is out of our hands
Though we may not know the reason just yet
When your faith fails
When your dreams sleep
Let there be hope in the dark of the night
For every heart that's lying in wait
Though I couldn't even count all the way
There's a time to be still
Let the river carry you where it will
When your faith fails
When your dreams sleep
When the best laid plans unravel
They ask me how I feel and if my love is real
And how I know I'll make it through
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter
I believe in you even though we are apart
I believe in you even on the morning after
Where I will always be renewed
And that which you've given me today is worth more than I could pay
I believe in you when winter turn to summer
I believe in you when white turn to black
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered
From all the plans they do pursue
The chimes of time ring out the news
Another day is through
Someone slipped and fell
You may have longed for added strength
Your courage to renew
Do not be disheartened
For I have news for you
It is no secret what God can do
What He's done for others He will do for you
With arms wide open He'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do
There is no night for in His light
You'll never walk alone
Wherever you may roam
There is no power can conquer you
While God is on your side
Take Him at His promise
Don't run away and hide
It is no secret what God can do
What He's done for others He will do for you
With arms wide open He'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do
There will be peace in the valley for me
And the lion shall lie down by the lamb
And the beasts from the wild shall be led by a child
And I'll be changed from this creature that I am
There will be peace in the valley for me
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown
Has a wondrous attraction for me
For the dear lamb of God left his glory above
To bear it to dark calvary
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown
I will cling to the old rugged cross
I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
The Son of God discloses
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
He speaks and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
I'd stay in the garden with Him
His voice to me is calling
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
Soft as the voice of an angel
Breathing a lesson unheard
Hope with a gentle persuasion
Whispers a comforting word
Wait till the darkness is over
Wait till the tempest is done
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow
After the shower is gone
In its sorrow rejoice
If in the dusk of the twilight
Dimmed be the region afar
Wilt deepening darkness
Brighten the glimmering star
Then when the night is upon us
When the dark midnight is over
Watch for the breaking of day
In its sorrow rejoice
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see. Wait and see
Put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide kindness will be your guide
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart
When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the works
I hear the rolling thunder
The universe displayed
When Christ shall come
With shouts of adulation
What joy shall filled my heart
And there proclaim My God
There was a child named Bernadette
I heard the story long ago
She saw the queen of heaven once
And kept the vision in her soul
No one believed what she had seen
No one believed what she heard
That there were sorrows to be healed
So many hearts I find
Broke like yours and mine
Torn by what we've done and can't undo
I just wanna hold you
Like Bernadette would do
And every now and then we try
To mend the damage that we've done
To think that I did not forget
So many hearts I find
Hearts like yours and mine
Torn by what we've done and can't undo
Like Bernadette would do
I just wanna hold you
Won't you let me hold you
I was a legend in my mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
Like a bridge over troubled water
When evening falls so hard
Like a bridge over troubled water
Like a bridge over troubled water
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind.
I was standing by the bedside of a neighbor
Who was bound to cross Jordan's swelling tide
And I asked him if he would do me a favor
And kindly take this message to the other side
If you see my Savior tell Him that you saw me
When you reach that golden city think about me
And don't forget to tell the Savior what I said
Though you have to make this journey on without me
We are climbing Jacob's ladder
We are climbing Jacob's ladder
We are climbing Jacob's ladder
Soldiers of the cross.
Every rung goes higher and higher
Every rung goes higher and higher
Soldiers of the cross.
Do you think I made the soldier
Do you think I made the soldier
Do you think I made the soldier
Soldier of the cross.
Soldier of the cross.
Soldier of the cross.
Soldier of the cross.
Though like the wanderer the sun gone down
But the fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
When we finally kiss good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
As long as you love me so
He doesn't care if it's in below
By the fires glossy glow
He don't care about the cold
And the winds that blow
And the lights turned low
Since we've no place to go
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought lots of corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
When we finally say good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll only hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
Long as you love me so
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight
For Christ is born of Mary and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
A merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
A merry little Christmas
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Gather near to us once more
We all will be together
Upon the highest bough
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
And will go for a walk is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas everywhere you go
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas eve
Then how the reindeer loved him
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas eve
Then how the reindeer loved him
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Is a fairytale they say
But the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Was alive as he could be
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Knew the sun was hot that day
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop
Had to hurry on his way
I'll be back again some day
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
And with his blood mankind has bought.
Glory to the new born King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled
Join the triumph of the skies
With the angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Glory to the new born King
Light and life to all He brings
Risen with healing in His wings
Mild he lays his glory by
Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth
Glory to the new born King
You sent your son to save us
Your very self you gave us
That sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more
When in the crib they found you
A golden halo crowned you
They gathered all around you
They had begun to doubt you
What did they know about you
But they were lost without you
They needed you so bad
You sent your son to save us
Your very self you gave us
That sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more
When in the crib they found you
A golden halo crowned you
Everybody is going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how he set set me free
A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool that's blind and just can't see
I'd welcome him right back here in my arms
Forget about the past and find me somebody new
I've thought of everything from A to Z
Forget about the past and find me somebody new
I've thought of everything from A to Z
To live in memory of the lonesome time
I can't stop wanting you it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday
Those happy hours that we once knew
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart
To live in memory of the lonesome time
I can't stop wanting you it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday
To live in memory of the lonesome times
But I can't help falling in love with you
If I can't help falling in love with you
For I can't help falling in love with you
For I can't help falling in love with you
For I can't help falling in love with you
And I never thought that I'd ever lose
You've got me singing the blues
There's nothing left for me to do
You've got me singing the blues
There's nothing left for me to do
You've got me singing the blues
The dream is gone I thought was mine
There's nothing left for me to do
You've got me singing the blues
You've got me singing the blues
How many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
But I really don't want to know
How many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow
But I really don't want to know
So always make me wonder
And even if I ask you
Just let it remain your secret
Never felt like this until I kissed ya
How did I exist until I kissed ya
Never had you on my mind
Now you're there all the time
Now I can't live without ya
And I didn't realize what a kiss could be
Now I can't live without ya
And I didn't realize what a kiss could be
Now I can't live without ya
Are you lonesome tonight
Do you miss me tonight
Does your memory stray
To a bright summer day
And called you sweetheart
Do the chairs in your parlor
Do you gaze at your doorstep
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again
Are you lonesome tonight
Do the chairs in your parlor
Do you gaze at your doorstep
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again
Are you lonesome tonight
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again
Anytime you're feeling lonely
Anytime you're feeling blue
Anytime you feel downhearted
That will prove your love for me is true
Anytime you're thinking about me
That's the time I'll be thinking of you
That's the time I'll come back home to you
Anytime will be the right time
Anytime at all will do
That's the time I'll come back home to you
There goes my baby with someone new
He was my baby till you stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been
I'm through with you romance
I'm through with love
And here's the reason that I'm so free
This time gonna try to keep it light
No use in dying of confusion
Skipping straight through to where
I'm thinking like Confucian
I'm too old to waste tomorrow
So you broke my heart and I lied
What's the point in wondering why
Just another test in loves little game show
In the story of my life
You're just a scene in an episode
You were never big enough to change who I am
This time gonna try to keep it light
No use in dying of confusion
Skipping straight through to where
I'm thinking like Confucian
I'm too old to waste tomorrow
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whispers of the raindrops blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
I'll get along and you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whispers of the raindrops blowing soft against the window
Make believe you love me one more time
My love has been untrue
He's found somebody new
I can not make believe
That I don't sit and grieve
I can't pretend and say
I've been throwing horseshoes
Over my left shoulder
I've spent most all my life
That's the way love goes
That's the music God has made
For all the world to sing
Losing makes me sorry
Don't you know I love you too
That's the way love goes
That's the music God made
For all the world to sing
Don't you know I love you too
That's the way love goes
Don't you know I love you too
Each time I see you again
How can I be just your friend
You want me to act like we've never kissed
And I've tried and I've tried but I haven't yet
You walk by and I fall to pieces
Each time someone speaks your name
Time only adds to the flame
You tell me to find someone else to love
But each time I go out with somebody new
You walk by and I fall to pieces
You walk by and I fall to pieces
Tennessee Waltz by Anne Murray
When an old friend I happened to see
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember the night of the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
You took the part that once was my heart
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
You took the part that once was my heart
You took the part that once was my heart
You must remember this
A kiss is just a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
And when two lovers woo
No matter what the future brings
Moonlight and love songs
Hearts full of passion
And man must have his mate
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
The world will always welcome lovers
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
The world will always welcome lovers
The world will always welcome lovers
Stars shining bright above you
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me
Still craving your kiss
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me
Still craving your kiss
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me
But in your dreams whatever they be
I wonder who's kissing him now
I wonder who's showing him how
I wonder who's looking into his eyes
For lips that I used to call mine
And I wonder if he ever tells her of me
I wonder who's kissing him now
I wonder who's buying the wine
For lips that I used to call mine
And I wonder if he ever tells her of me
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lot of kisses on the bottom
I'm gonna smile and say I hope you're feeling better
And sign with love the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words oh so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lot of kisses on the bottom
I'm gonna smile and say I hope you're feeling better
And sign with love the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly
Somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly
When purple colored curtains mark the end of day
Deepening shadows gather splendor as day is done
Fingers of night will soon surrender the setting sun
Here in the afterglow of day
We keep our rendezvous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way
I fall in love again as I did then
Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me with dreams untold
Each day I pray for evening just to be with you
Here in the afterglow of day
We keep our rendezvous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way
I fall in love again as I did then
Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me with dreams untold
Each day I pray for evening just to be with you
Life is a book that we study
Some of it's leaves bring a sigh
Nights are long since you went away
I think about you all through the day
Just long to know that you understand
Your buddy misses you
Just long to know that you understand
Your buddy misses you
You'll miss the dearest pal you
There come a time when you'll you regret it
Your heart will break like mine
And you'll want me only
After you've gone away
You will find that you were blind
To let somebody come and change your
After the years we've been together
You'll long to be with me
Right back were you started
Gone is the romance that was so divine
But now that our love dreams have
When you are far away
With just a photograph
With only dreams of you
I get the books down from the shelf
And what's with programs on the air
I keep pretty much to myself
Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
My minds more at ease
Been invited on dates
Awfully different without you
Don't get around much any more
When there are clouds in the sky
Through your fear and sorrow
Come shining through for you
Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
You'll find that life is still worth
I didn't want to do it
I didn't want to do it
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it
You made me happy sometimes
You made me feel so bad
I didn't wanna tell ya
I didn't wanna tell ya
I want some love that's true
Give me what I cry for
The kind of kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me love you
In all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces
The park across the way
The children's carousel
In every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I know we'll meet again some
Just like you always do
Drive the dark clouds far away
To the folks that I know
They'll be happy to know
That as you saw me go
To the folks that I love
They'll be happy to know
That as you saw me go
I know we'll meet again some sunny
I guess I never will be over you
I have tried but it's so hard to do
I'm surrounded by the memories
Time goes by and I'm still holding on
Waiting for the day when you come home
If you ever change your mind again
I will greet you like a long lost friend
In my heart we've never reached the end
And I never will be over you
Even though I know that you're not mine
Just as long as there's a chance that I
Guess I never will be over you
Life's like walking down a lonely street
I see you in everyone I meet
How I long to see your smiling face
No one else could ever take your place
And I never will be over you
I've hungered for your touch
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Godspeed your love to me
Lonely rivers flow to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
I've hungered for your touch
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Everybody needs a reason to believe
Something to keep them going
To set their soul on fire
It's their inspiration
Some find it in living off the land
Some find it in working for the man
Some find it with a bottle in their hand
That's what gets them through
Some find it in the magazines they read
Some find happiness out of reach
No matter what they do
I always wondered when
My search was gonna end
And I'd find what I've been missing
Now everything you are
Goes right to my heart and feeds this passion
Some find it in living off the land
Some find it in working for the man
Some find it with a bottle in their hand
That's what gets them through
Some find it in the magazines they read
Some find happiness out of reach
No matter what they do
You're what I can never live without
Some find it in living off the land
Some find it in working for the man
Some find it with a bottle in their hand
That's what gets them through
Some find it in the magazines they read
Some find happiness out of reach
No matter what they do
Thinking about you and me
You made me love you so bad
You made me love you so bad
You made me love you so bad
Too bad you're no good
You smile like an angel
You wouldn't change if you could
You made me love you so bad
You made me love you so bad
You made me love you so bad
Too bad you're no good
You're dropping around
Trash talking is talking me down
When you pull that stuff
You made me love you so bad
You made me love you so bad
You made me love you so bad
Too bad you're no good
I talked to your mother
I talked to your brother
The hardest thing I have to comprehend
Is if I had to do it over
You made me love you so bad
You made me love you so bad
You made me love you so bad
Too bad you're no good
Too bad you're no good
You just ain't no good
Too bad you're no good
You just ain't no good
She looked out the window
He used to watch those bluebirds for hours
That old man used to plant tomatoes
Right there in the middle of my flowers
She told me come that August
She'd be fifteen years without him
But it felt just like he was there
As Grandma talked about him
Love has a life of it's own
It's never really gone
As long as one heart remembers
Time could never take away the years
Full laughter and tears
Or one moment shared together
Love has a life of it's own
And it lives on forever
And she pulled out his picture
But she opened up his Bible
And read his favorite scripture
She had painted me a portrait
Of the man he used to be
And though she's with him now
They'll always be a part of me
Love has a life of it's own
It's never really gone
As long as one heart remembers
Time could never take away the years
Full laughter and tears
Or one moment shared together
Love has a life of it's own
And it lives on forever
Love has a life of it's own
It's never really gone
If one heart remembers
Love has a life of it's own
And it live on forever
You couldn't be any more cool
I think I got a thing for you
And I'm thinking that you see it too
I like it when you smile at me
In your torn blue jeans
Your sunglasses mirroring me
And I like what I see
Maybe it's time to move a little closer
My arms wrapped tight around you
And I wonder if I should steal a kiss from your cheek
Or tell you I've been dreaming of this so long
We'll take a lift down that old dirt road
I know a place we can go
We'll see how good you are at skipping stones
Where the sweet river rolls
We'll carve our names in that old oak tree
Where they don't talk about you and me
Maybe it's time to move a little closer
My arms wrapped tight around you
And I wonder if I should steal a kiss from your cheek
Or tell you I've been dreaming of this so long
And when you hold my hand
I don't think you understand
How my heart beats out of my chest
I can hardly catch my breath
Maybe it's time to move a little closer
My arms wrapped tight around you
And I wonder if I should steal a kiss from your cheek
Maybe it's time to move a little closer
My arms wrapped tight around you
And I wonder if I should steal a kiss from your cheek
I've taken love for granted
And I've come up empty handed
I'm lost and feeling stranded
I feel like the world is watching
Can't breathe my heart is stopping
Sun melts and fades away to another day
To give you all of my heart
I know you're out there somewhere
Tell me how to get there
I hope will lead me straight to you
I know you're out there somewhere
Breathing in the same air
Thinking that I'm out there somewhere too
My heart is feeling so cold
And I can feel you getting closer
I've been hurt and I can't stand it
I want love just like I planned it
And don't you know I've waited so long
I know you're out there somewhere
Tell me how to get there
I hope will lead me straight to you
I know you're out there somewhere
Breathing in the same air
I can feel you thinking that
I'm out there somewhere too
Feeling love so strong
I wanna be by your side
Like a rose to the rain
Like a mark to the flame
Just tell me how to get there
I hope will lead me straight to you
I know you're out there somewhere
Breathing in the same air
I can feel you thinking
That I'm out there somewhere too
I know you're out there
It was the third of June
I was out chopping cotton
And my brother was bailing hay
We stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door
Y'all remember to wipe your feet
I got some news this morning from Choctaw Ridge
And Papa said to Mama
There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow
And Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe
Seems like nothing ever comes
To no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And Brother said he recollected
When he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
I'll have another piece of apple pie
You know it don't seem right
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
I've been cooking all morning
And you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you
And she and Billy Joe was throwing something off the Tallahatchie Bridge
And Brother married Becky Thompson
They bought a store in Tupelo
Papa caught it and he died last spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
I spend a lot of time
Picking flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
I'm tired of hearing your voice on my answering machine
Seems like you've forgotten all the things you did to me
So don't pretend you're lonely
You're the one who walked away
So here's what you can do
Put it in the Sunday paper
Hang it on a billboard on the street
Tell it to your dog walker
Tell it to the clerk at the grocery store
Put it in the Sunday paper
I don't want to hear it anymore
Put it in the Sunday paper
I don't want to hear it anymore
You said that you needed space
You know this ain't your street
I got the phone number
If you want to place an ad or two
They've got friendly operators
Who will gladly assist you
Put it in the Sunday paper
Hang it on a billboard on the street
Tell it to your dog walker
Tell it to the clerk at the grocery store
Put it in the Sunday paper
I don't want to hear it anymore
Put it in the Sunday paper
I don't want to hear it anymore
You got so much time on your hands
Then give it to charity
On the scoreboard of the football game
Write it with a sharpie on your forehead
And walk around for days
Tell it to your nosy neighbor
And put it up on your front door
Put it in the Sunday paper
I don't want to hear it anymore
Put it in the Sunday paper
Hang it on a billboard on the street
Tell it to your dog walker
Tell it to the clerk at the grocery store
Put it in the Sunday paper
I don't want to hear it anymore
Put it in the Sunday paper
I don't want to hear it anymore
Put it in the Sunday paper
Can't get you off my mind
I can't get you out of my dreams
You'll never leave gets to me
And I'm back to blue again
I bet I've cried a million tears
I bet I've used up every star
Just wishing you were here
And I'm back to blue again
Oh if someone could just show me how
If time can really heal a heart
Tell me how long will it take yeah
So I won't have to go
Oh if someone could just show me how
If time can really heal a heart
Tell me how long will it take yeah
So I won't have to go
So I won't have to go
We've been walking on a tightrope
Afraid of falling down
Maybe it's time to hit the ground
All that really matters
Is that we don't stop at the edge
The only way to be happy after
Is when we get out of our heads
When you wrap your arms around me
Than I ever thought it could be
Caught up in the moment
Hypnotized by your kiss
Your love really stalls me
And don't it feel good
That's what it's all about
Caught up in the moment
Hypnotized by your kiss
My daddy wanted a house full of boys
Fishing bundles of noise
He told my mama enough is enough
So we started walking
Baiting our own hooks
And learning to shoot
You know the reason Daddy lost his hair
There's just something about us
They just can't figure out us
Who really rules the world
There's just something about us
They just can't figure out us
Who really rules the world
There's just something about us
They just can't figure out us
Who really rules the world
You just can't live without us
Who really rules the world
It's a beautiful night to be lonely
All curled up in my favorite chair
Playing old Patsy too
There's a soft silver glow in my window
Seducing this empty room
Your memory makes my heart swirl
Or maybe it's just the moon
We dreamed just like young lovers do
We dreamed just like young lovers do
I'm content to be perfectly lonely
Now that I'm over you
The pale light shines through my window
And it makes me think of you
Love can go to your head
Love can go to your bed
And stay there all night long
Love can go on and on
Like a Sunday morning sparrow
Love can to your heart
That's where I am without you in it
Every day's just another night by myself
Like roses in a vase of whiskey
And fold these idle hands
Call some friends and make some plans
I can get drunk on a Saturday night
And try to fall for someone new
But I just wake up hungover
That's where I am without you in it
Like roses in a vase of whiskey
And I don't hate you at all
It's all love's fault
That's where I am without you in it
Every day's just another night by myself
Like roses in a vase of whiskey
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true
But you can't say that you
To anything crazy but me so
Don't text me anymore and
Don't call me anymore whoa hey
You can delete me from your contacts
And delete the ring tone you use for
But you can't say HOT to me oh oh
Don't text me anymore and
Don't call me anymore whoa hey
You can delete me from your contacts
And delete the ring tone you use for
And I removed you from
To send me a friend request
Don't text me anymore and
Don't call me anymore whoa hey
You can delete me from your contacts
And delete the ring tone you use for
Don't text me anymore and
Don't call me anymore whoa hey
You can delete me from your contacts
And delete the ring tone you use for
Time passes by so quickly
But I guess I thought you'd be here forever
I never even had the chance
There's so many things to tell you
Left unsaid until now
Can you hear me when I talk to you
Do the words I say ever make it through
Can you hear me when I talk to you
Every night I have the same dream
The one where you get to hold me
It always leaves me feeling helpless
Can you hear me when I talk to you
Do you know how much I'd love to be with you
Can you hear me when I talk to you
Living in this world without you
Hoping that I find some treasures
All that I took for granted
Can you hear me when I talk to you
Can you hear me when I talk to you
You know I never said some things that I meant to
Can you hear me when I talk to you
This small town moves just a little too slow
I got dreams to dream
The gypsy girl inside of me just needs to be free
Get a little bit wild
A little bit crazy on my own
Free down the highway
Gonna make them my way
We're going for a ride
I'm gonna hit this road and where I go
Only God and heaven knows
I guess I'll know when I get there
Get a little bit wild
A little bit crazy on my own
Free down the highway
Gonna make them my way
We're going for a ride
Get a little bit wild
A little bit crazy on my own
Free down the highway
Gonna make them my way
We're going for a ride
Some people get there kicks from high stakes gambling
They love to roll the dice.
I know you feel it too
I get a rush from you
Yeah I get a rush from you
I don't know how to talk about it
I get a rush from you
I get a rush from you
I know you feel it too
I get a rush from you
I get a rush from you
I know you feel it too
The shadow of love is broken and
I have just let go of everything
But lately I can't get over these
Feelings for you and I don't know
I gotta walk away from this
Situation I gotta walk away
From this conversation we're
Having I gotta move on and
I always try to tell myself to
Let you go but when I do I get
So know this is what I do
I gotta walk away from this
Situation I gotta walk away
From this conversation we're
Having I gotta move on and
I cannot break these habits I
Have oh these habits of loving
You then hating you no I can't
I gotta walk away from this
Situation I gotta walk away
From this conversation we're
Having I gotta move on and
I know what you think about
Ford trucks and Friday night football
Staying up all night on a phone call
I know you said you wanna take it slow
Tell me what you think about us
Tell me how you feel when we touch
I just wanna know that you're feeling this
And when we kiss you can't get enough
Tell me what you say to your friends
Every time my number comes up
Tell me what you think about us
I know you wanna work hard and make you a good life
Settle down someday with a good wife
But right now I wanna be the only thing on your mind
Tell me what you think about us
Tell me how you feel when we touch
I just wanna know that you're feeling this
And when we kiss you can't get enough
Tell me what you say to your friends
Every time my number comes up
Tell me what you think about us
I wonder what you'd say if I said I might
Be falling for you right here tonight
I wanna be the one that calls you baby
Tell me what you think about us
Tell me how you feel when we touch
I just wanna know that you're feeling this
And when we kiss you can't get enough
Tell me what you say to your friends
Every time my number comes up
Tell me what you think about us
Everyone's talking about
And they're so unhappy
They say this married life
They say they'd give anything
To be living wild and free
They say their husbands don't mow the lawn
And he doesn't ever offer anymore
To take out the trash
They say they'd rather be alone
Oh but if they were they'd see
They say the grass is always greener
But if I had someone to love
Then I'd be satisfied
I would never take for granted
Something so hard to find
So if you've got a good love tonight
Please don't let him go
Unless you really are prepared
To live life on your own
Holding onto nothing but a dream
They say the grass is always greener
But if I had someone to love
Then I'd be satisfied
I would never take for granted
Something so hard to find
It hurts to be in bed at night
Holding onto nothing but a dream
When I grow up I wanna pony
I'm gonna brush her mane
And feed her sugar cane
And keep her in safe from the storm
When I grow up I wanna baby
I'm gonna name it after Ralph Stanley
And I sure I won't mind
When it cries all night
Just as long as it looks like me
When I grow up I wanna a cowboy
With dust all over his jeans
With a horse named Jack
He is nice but he looks so mean
When I grow up I'll be a lady
All my rings will be made of gold
I'll put flowers in my room
I won't listen to rock and roll
When I grow up I wanna be
When I grow up I wanna be
When I grow up I wanna be your girl
When I grow up I wanna pony
When I grow up I wanna baby
When I grow up I wanna cowboy
I want him but he don't want me
He wants somebody else that I can't be
And she's got a man that she wants to leave
Does it have to be wrong to make it feel right
Ain't nobody satisfied
Of a love that's long gone from his past
And his wife's got a letter that she can't read
From a boy who never came back from the sea
All these secrets are lies we keep deep inside
Does it have to be wrong to make it feel right
Ain't nobody satisfied yeah
Yeah what are the odds he's the one for me
And what if I pass him by and he's got the love I need
Ain't nobody satisfied
I want him but he don't want me
He wants somebody else that I can't be
And she's got a man that she wants to leave
Like an old piano played for generations
Slowly fading out of tune
Like the soles on the bottom of my favorite pair
I know I'm not some bright and shiny
Car that's sparkling new
Right off the salesroom floor
Yeah I've got some dents and bruises
I've been dropped and there's a scar
I'll worth a whole lot more
Like a book read so many times
Front to back it starts to split in two
Like a house where a family lived
Until they died and there's a soul in every room
I know I'm not some brand new dress
Hanging there perfectly pressed
That never has been worn
I've got some buttons missing
And there's a couple stains
And places where the fabric has been torn
I'll be worth a whole lot more
It's over baby one more time
Don't make me sit alone and cry
You don't even want to talk to me
You won't take me back when I come around
You say you're sorry but then you push me out
I got a big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
See I got a candle that burns so bright
In my window every night
You don't have to see me standing around
Feel like I've been shot and didn't fall down
You won't take me back when I come around
You say you're sorry but then you push me out
I got a big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
You turn off trouble like you turn off a light
Went off and left me it just ain't right
Yeah I around every corner something I see
Brings me right back how it used to be
You won't take me back when I come around
You say you're sorry but then you push me out
I got a big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
You won't take me back when I come around
You say you're sorry but then you push me out
I got a big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
You've been out with the boys
Don't you think it's time to put your toys away
You make me laugh the way you pout
When I tell you that you can't stay out to play now
Go ahead stick out your lip
I can pitch a bigger fit
That's why we call each other baby
The way we carry on sometimes
Up all night driving each other crazy
Why don't we sing a lullaby
When you don't get what you want
You go a crying on the telephone to mama
You call me names slam a door
Make me a pallet on the bedroom floor for drama
Acting like a little child
If it wouldn't make you make that smile
That's why we call each other baby
The way we carry on sometimes
Up all night driving each other crazy
Why don't we sing a lullaby
That's why we call each other baby
The way we carry on sometimes
Up all night driving each other crazy
Why don't we sing a lullaby
Make room at the bottom
Make room at the bottom
Somebody save me a place
Make room at the bottom
My hearts been broken
Make room at the bottom
Somebody clear me some space
Make room at the bottom
I've been kicked around
Make room at the bottom
Somebody save me a place
Somebody clear me some space
Somebody save me a place
You say you had to go
I tried to understand
When you call me from Santa Fe
And said you needed one more day
And you'd be back to hold my hand
Ah but you let me down again
And winter turned to spring
And you called from Tennessee
And you got the best of me
You promised me you wouldn't stay
In Memphis one more day
And you'd be back to hold my hand
Ah but you let me down again
And you called from the coast
And it was me you missed the most
You promised me you wouldn't stay
In Mobile more than one more day
And you'd be back to hold my hand
And said you needed one more day
And you'd be back home again
You promised me you wouldn't stay
In Denver more than one more day
And you'd be back to hold my hand
And you called me from Santa Fe
And said you needed on more day
And you'd be back home again
Ain't ate a thing since he went away
Tried everything but it ain't working
These tears keep rolling down my face
Heart laying the street covered in a white sheet
Pounded my heart with a nine pound hammer
Left it in stitches and didn't look back
Heart laying the street covered in a white sheet
Looking back now I never saw it coming
I didn't know I fell until I hit the floor
Heart laying the street covered in a white sheet
I wouldn't let him close his eyes
And I'd of kept the coffee strong
You can't let all those good people down
I wouldn't let him close his eyes
I'd of kept the coffee strong
When his hands started trembling
And his body turning cold
And death started tugging at his soul
Held him tight and begged him not to go
I wouldn't let him close his eyes
I wear him like a tattoo
I wear him like a scar
I wear him like a hangover
That ain't worn off so far
I pour him cups of coffee
I take him in my dreams
I talk to him like he's still here
But you won't ever see him
The mirror tells a story
That I don't want to hear
The reflection of a broken girl
Has never been more clear
That's a good excuse to call
When he left he took it all
I know what I did wrong
And I wish he'd come back home
I could go out tonight
And find some stranger
There ain't no chains here
There ain't no place here
On this earth I'd rather be
I could want somebody else
I could need somebody else
I could love somebody other than you
There's no good help there for me now
There's nothing I can't do without
You make me feel like heaven's
I could want somebody else
I could need somebody else
I could love somebody other than you
I could dream somebody else
Be treated like a queen by someone else
I could love somebody other than you
I could want somebody else
I could need somebody else
I could love somebody other than you
I could dream somebody else
Be treated like a queen by someone else
I could love somebody other than you
Don't wait for me when I'm dead and gone
For I'll just be going home
Heaven's light will shine on me
It will lead to eternity
When I take my final breath
Lay these feeble bones to rest
And I will run through Heaven's gates
Where my blessed Savior waits
And he will take me by my hand
And I'll be happier than I've ever been
Now don't you worry we'll meet again
And stay together in the promised land
And I will hear my daddy sing
And I will cry tears of joy
When I see my little baby boy
And he will take me by my hand
And I'll be happier than I've ever been
Now don't you worry we'll meet again
And stay together in the promised land
And I'll be happier than I've ever been
Now don't you worry we'll meet again
I was only thirteen when Daddy died
How I came out like a rose
And I came out like a rose
I got a one way ticket as far as it goes
And I came out like a rose
So I'm headed south to anywhere that ain't so damn cold
Where I can warm my heart and shake the chill from my bones
And I came out like a rose
And I came out like a rose
I bet I'm the talk of this town
And I hate to admit they were right
Looks like I've gained some weight
Landlord's at the door
He says the rent can't wait
But I'm a dollar short
Know that I got a secret that I'm gonna keep
Sometimes that's just what you get
Looks like I've gained some weight
Landlord's at the door
And says the rent can't wait
But I'm a dollar short
Looks like I've gained some weight
I know the Bible says
That you're supposed to wait
But I'm a dollar short
Like an old piano played for generations
Slowly fading out of tune
Like the soles on the bottom of my favorite pair
I know I'm not some bright and shiny
Car that's sparkling new
Right off the salesroom floor
Yeah I've got some dents and bruises
I've been dropped and there's a scar
I'll worth a whole lot more
Like a book read so many times
Front to back it starts to split in two
Like a house where a family lived
Until they died and there's a soul in every room
I know I'm not some brand new dress
Hanging there perfectly pressed
That never has been worn
I've got some buttons missing
And there's a couple stains
And places where the fabric has been torn
I'll be worth a whole lot more
You get home from work and then we just turn out the lights
Give me weed instead of roses
I don't need a card from Hallmark
Give me weed instead of roses
And let's see where it goes
There ain't no one else for me
But lately we have fallen under the same routine
Let's trade in the boxers for some sexy underwear
Give me weed instead of roses
I don't need a card from Hallmark
Give me weed instead of roses
And let's see where it goes
Let's send the kids to grandma
Put on some heavy metal
Rip the phone off of the hook
We both know what he's been growing
I'll be waiting with the whipped cream
Get me weed instead of roses
I don't need a card from Hallmark
Give me weed instead of roses
And let's see where it goes
You pull out the Polaroid
Let's get a little wild
I lay down to sleep at night
Until the craving for you wakes me up
I reach out to grab you
Gotta have you yeah until I've had enough
We can lock the world outside
Close my eyes give in until and then we'll fly
You're a secret that I'm gonna try to keep
You run straight for me
I'm getting good at letting these excuses
Roll so easy off my tongue
You're getting good at making me feel nothing
You run straight for me
I lay down to sleep at night
But after the third one
And not really thinking
Just wanted something
Like the morning after
Can cut a heart so deeply.
An that night I lost everything that mattered
And I thought I couldn't get any sadder
Like the morning after.
The morning after the storm
The morning after all the rain
When you wake up and you realize
That you'll never be the same.
Just give me something
Mama played piano in a Pentecostal church
I did what I did to get by
A third grade education won't bring you no luck
Turned fourteen and stole a pickup truck
Couldn't make it on minimum wage
Couldn't make it on minimum wage
I had me one foot in the grave
But they'll never catch Monroe Suede
Never shot nobody with a loaded gun
But I found me a lover or two
I had me one foot in the grave
But they'll never catch Monroe Suede
And they call me Monroe Suede
I had me one foot in the grave
But they'll never catch Monroe Suede
She's driving me out of your mind
The thing she's doing's already been done
She's driving me out of your mind
Looking in your eyes I see her future and my past
She's driving me out of your mind
Anything worth trying I've already tried
Anything worth saving has already died
Loving you baby's been one long hard ride
She's driving me out of your mind
Looking in your eyes I see her future and my past
She's driving me out of your mind
Loving you baby's been one long hard ride
Wheels are gonna rust
If they don't turn enough
And so the story goes
Draw lines around your eyes
It's coming either way
I feel like I'm on to something good
I'm better moving on than going back
I'll ride this train till it runs out of track
I can't tell you how or where I'm heading now
But the winding of the road is steadying my soul
Feels like I'm coming home
Life's got it's way of showing when it's the right time
Hard times roll up but they don't hang around
I feel like I'm on to something good
I'm better moving on than going back
I'll ride this train till it runs out of track
Hard times roll up but they don't hang around
I feel like I'm on to something good
I'm better moving on than going back
Oh I feel like I'm on
Feel like I'm onto something
Heart broke and beating out of my chest
I cried out your name against my will
A memory I can't kill
I buried your love alive
Getting tired and I don't wanna deal
You left me holding too damn much to feel
It drives me crazy and it makes me cry
Wish I could make it die
I buried your love alive
I confess I did not want to let you go
So I buried your love alive
Heart broke and beating out of my chest
I cried out your name against my will
Go without saying a word
Save it for a rainy day
It'll never be a good time
I could tell you face to face
So I wouldn't have to carry this weight
It'll never be a good time
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
All that I know is I can't go back
So I'm driving fast as I can
It ain't the easy way
There's always a price to pay
For dropping a bombshell
The weight of the load
Brings everybody down
The rocks that they've thrown
With the weight of the load
The hardest of hearts
With the weight of the load
When you're at the end of your road
Thinking about giving up hope
True love's gonna find you
With the weight of the load
The weight of the load
Brings everybody down
The rocks that they've thrown
They're killing you now
Start calling you out
With the weight of the load
The weight of the load
The weight of the load
The weight of the load
With the weight of the load
I felt the razor against my heart
I thought we were both in all the way
You caught it by the handle
And I caught it by the blade
And I caught it by the blade
And you give it all you've got to give
You'll reach and they won't
You'll bleed and they don't
I kept trying and you just stopped
Now I know how you can sound so brave
And I caught it by the blade
And you give it all you've got to give
You'll reach and they won't
You'll bleed and they don't
I thought we were both in all the way
But you caught it by the handle
And I caught it by the blade
I got a good foundation
Got a floor I've been pacing
And a broken heart breaking
I'm on a winning streak
I got a bottle that's empty
When I gambled my last 50
But it ain't easy streak
I'm on a winning streak
Gone as low as a low can go
Standing at the old crossroads
Damned old devil won't buy my soul
I'm on a winning streak
And my guitar strings are rusted
Had somebody that I trusted
Leave me broke and busted
Now I'm drowning in defeat
I'm on a winning streak
I'm on a winning streak
Today's gonna be your birthday
Even if it's not the 10th of September
Sometimes down here you will find
Life won't give you peace of mind
It's like you're holding on to a dying ember
But it's alright to remember
Close your eyes and you'll see
You're the apple of my eye
You do things you think you don't
You can grow a rose right out of the winter
But it's alright to remember
Close your eyes and you'll see
But it's alright to remember
Close your eyes and you'll see
I wouldn't be half lit drunk
Wrapping my number on a coaster
Sliding it to a stranger
Walking crooked justifying all my bad behavior
Tangled up in someone's arms I know I won't see later
I wouldn't be getting good at getting good at staying calm
Or sitting high and mighty on my broken throne
I wouldn't be cursing God for leaving me here all alone
I wouldn't be stuck between a rock and being stung
But it wouldn't change its mind
I wouldn't be replaying what it was and what it wasn't
Or thinking I could change if I only saw it coming
It wouldn't take everything I have to rise above it
There'd be some kind of peace
But it wouldn't change its mind
And I'd be over it like you
But it wouldn't change its mind
Has anybody ever told you
They'd be lucky just to know you
How many nights spent wishing they could hold you
Has anybody ever told you
And when you walk into a dark room
Light of a thousand moons surround you
Yeah there's just something about you
Has anybody ever told you
Baby you don't have to try
Your light just shines on its own
And when I stand beside you
I don't know how to explain it
Oh but you keep my sky from raining
Yeah and you turn the gray to bright blue
Has anybody ever told you
Baby you don't have to try
Your light just shines on its own
And when I stand beside you
Has anybody ever told you
They'd be lucky just to know you
How many nights spent wishing they could hold you
Has anybody ever told you
I know I'm not the first to wanna hold you
If I ever get out of Dixie
Gonna buy me some brand new shoes
If I ever get out of Tennessee
Gonna live just like a high and mighty
Gonna get what I deserve
It was the mines that killed my daddy
It was the law that killed my man
It was the Bible belt that whipped me
When I broke the Fifth Command
I don't hate the weather
I don't hate the land
But if I had my way I'd never see this place again
When I tread out of these parts
Look me up on the other side
I'm out walking in dark alleys
Searching for shadows in the valleys
If the devil don't want me
If I can't see the light
If there ain't enough whiskey
To kill the fire in my soul
If the devil don't want me
Picking up pieces of broken strangers
I'm at rock bottom with a smoke and a sin
If the devil don't want me
If I can't see the light
If there ain't enough whiskey
To kill the fire in my soul
If the devil don't want me
To kill the fire in my soul
If the devil don't want me
If April showers bring May flowers
And a flower brings a smile
Then I can't complain about all this rain
I didn't think we'd make it through
I was trying but I could not remember
The last time I'd seen your eyes so blue
And if I have to wait
I'll bring them home to you
What I wouldn't give to see you
With a gold back in your head
If I could look out the kitchen window in the garden
And see you standing there
If April showers bring May flowers
And a flower brings a smile
Then I can't complain about all this rain
And if I have to wait
And if I have to wait
I'll hang around a day or two
I've always been a rolling stone
And I don't love you anymore
You're a fool for not believing
I've tried and I've tried
I've prayed and I've stayed too long
If something comes over me
I got a knack for being free
I'm just following a feeling
A couple times I said I do
A couple times I said we're through
I never really seem to get what I was needing
I'm good at packing up my car
I'm good at honky tonks and bars
I'm bad at staying home and cleaning
I've tried and I've tried
I've prayed and I've stayed too long
If something comes over me
I got a knack for being free
I'm just following a feeling
I've tried and I've tried
I've prayed and I've stayed too long
If something comes over me
I got a knack for being free
I'm just following a feeling
I got a knack for being free
I'm bad at hearing babies screaming
And every kiss you give still takes me by surprise
So I thought that I would tell the world today
My life has changed so ill say
You are not a stranger. You're not just friend
You are not just lover who is sleeping in my bed
You are everything I wanted and love
You wash me with you eyes
You give me all your time
Someone I can't forget and I always dreamed Id find
So I thought id tell the world today
All because of you ill never be the same
You are not a stranger. You're not just friend
You are not just lover who is sleeping in my bed
You are everything I wanted and love
So many times I told you so
I guess I wanted you to know.
You are not a stranger. You're not just friend
You are not just lover who is sleeping in my bed
You are everything I wanted and love
I'm flat on the floor
With my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
I'm hiding from the storm till the damage gets done
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
I'm hiding from the storm till the damage gets done
You think you gonna live without my love now
I don't know why you gotta keep coming around
Creeping up my street
Now I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
I'm hiding from the storm till the damage gets done
You ain't gonna get to me tonight
I'll lay right here till it all blows through
I ain't gonna raise my body
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
I'm hiding from the storm till the damage gets done
I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
I'm hiding from the storm till the damage gets
Now I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
I'm hiding from the storm till the damage gets done
Don't knock on my door
I've got a cold beer in my right hand
And I'm more than ready to see it gone
And I'm the only one who can set myself free
So I'm taking off this pain you put on me
I remember when you gave me that ring
It was supposed to mean something
You don't never even talk to me
I just get to do your laundry
You sit there and you watch the TV
Even when I'm looking sexy
But now I got this cold beer in my right hand
And I'm more than ready to see it gone
And I'm the only one who can set myself free
So I'm taking off this pain you put on me
And right now I'm feeling so right
And I'm being noticed for the first time in a long time
I hope you feel lost and alone
And I hope you miss me every second that I'm gone
While I got this cold beer in my right hand
And I'm more than ready to see it gone
And I'm the only one who can set myself free
So I'm taking off this pain you put on me
So I'm taking off this pain you put on me
I've got a cold beer in my right hand
We'll ride and watch for lightning bugs
We'll ride with the windows let down
There's nowhere else I'd rather be right now
On the bed of your truck
And ain't nothing like the sound of real country music
And I love to hear the whippoorwill sing any night
And the crickets out in the woods
Don't it sound so good
We'll stop on a old dirt road bridge
Do you remember when we painted our names on it
And we'll listen to the creek as it runs
And we'll count the stars
On the bed of your truck
And ain't nothing like the sound of real country music
And I love to hear the whippoorwill sing any night
And the crickets out in the woods
Don't it sound so good
On the bed of your truck
And ain't nothing like the sound of real country music
And I love to hear the whippoorwill sing any night
And the crickets out in the woods
Don't it sound so good
Don't it sound so good
I feel a million miles away
I believe I'm lost in the way you hold me
In my eyes we're the only ones here
And lost in the way I ain't ever cared so much
And hoping to god you feel like I do
Completely lost in you
I'm a little nervous about this feeling
I'm not sure how you feel or what you want to do
And hoping to god you feel like I do
Completely lost in you
I've got a baby at home
And a husband who comes home each night
It's my responsibility
And I'm usually in the bed by nine
But I still like a cold beer and a long dirt road
And listening to some Keith Whitley on the radio
Don't mean I ain't a good mama
Don't mean I ain't a good wife
I'm just like anybody else
That needs a break from time to time
And I know my obligations
I may be getting older
My life's a lot different now
I'm proud of how it's turned out
There's always something to be done
But I still like having fun
It's just part of who I am
I'll always like a cold beer and a long dirt road
And listening to some Hank Williams on the radio
Don't mean I ain't a good mama
Don't mean I ain't a good wife
I'm just like anybody else
That needs a break from time to time
I know my obligations
I may be getting older
I may be getting older
I ain't supposed to want to do a lot of drinking
I ain't supposed to stay out till all hours of the morning
I'm supposed to be a young lady
But I like my music loud
With a cooler close by
I like a pint of Crown
And staying out all night
And I like dirt roads and river banks
And something cold to drink
And one day I'm gonna have to settle down
I like being a little wild and having fun
Now don't tell me you've forgotten about all the things you've done
With a cooler close by
I like a pint of Crown
And staying out all night
And I like dirt roads and river banks
And something cold to drink
And one day I'm gonna have to settle down
With a cooler close by
I like a pint of Crown
And staying out all night
And I like them dirt roads and river banks
And something cold to drink
And one day I'm gonna have to settle down
I've got a pocket full of money I shouldn't spend
To drink him away again
My heart stops cold in my chest
He passes me by and grabs a stranger's hand
He pulls her on the floor to dance
He don't even know who I am
He's just an old memory
That don't remember me
And I can't get over him
Though it's been so long since he chose to leave
And I'm a grown woman
From that old memory that don't remember me
But I remember the smell of his cologne
And tonight he has it on
And I remember the feel of his skin
And I can't help but go back there again
That don't remember me
And I can't get over him
Though it's been so long since he chose to leave
And I'm a grown woman
From that old memory that don't remember me
Don't you want to come down
Here we play music with our own sound
A lot of our friendship
And music's been born and bred
Right here in our backyard
I remember the first time I walked through the door
The band was playing and I sang a few songs
Don't you want to come down
Here we play music with our own sound
A lot of our friendship
And music's been born and bred
Right here in our backyard
It's the place we built for the music that we play
Or you can shoot pool or you can throw darts any day
It's like our own private bar that's open every night
There ain't no closing time and no rules to go by
Don't you want to come down
Here we play music with our own sound
A lot of our friendship
And music's been born and bred
Right here in our backyard
And there's never any pressure
And if you ever hang out here
I bet you're gonna come back
Don't you want to come down
Here we play music with our own sound
A lot of our friendship
And music's been born and bred
Right here in our backyard
Right here in our backyard
I'm not trying to start anything
By coming up to you tonight
I know that he's yours now
It's sinking in with time
But tonight I've had too much to drink
And he stays on my mind
I just wanted to say he's the best
Thing you'll ever find
And I'm the crazy fool that let him go
He's the best man I've ever seen
I just wanted you to know
He ain't your regular Joe
She turned to me sharply and said
I can't believe you even spoke to me
What nerve you must have
You don't wanna be in my shoes
And I'm the crazy fool that let him go
He's the best man I've ever seen
I just wanted you to know
He ain't your regular Joe
So she drove home from that bar to say
That she was sorry to him
She was wrong to have stormed out to go
Somewhere she shouldn't have been
Everybody has their days
That's when she turned to him to say
And I don't ever plan to let you go
You're the best man I've ever seen
She sat in her hospital bed
Drawing pictures of the sky
And through all of the pain she felt
She had never asked why
But when the doctor walked in
With tears in her eyes
She looked at the doctor and said
Do they make them little
They say where I'm going
I won't feel no more pain
So I really need to know
I know it'd make her sad
I don't like to see her cry
And it does the same thing to Dad
And at night when I sleep
I see heaven in my dreams
So please won't you answer
Do they make them little
They say where I'm going
I won't feel no more pain
So I really need to know
And they say where I'm going
I won't feel no more pain
So I really need to know now
She's five foot three and Lord ain't she sweet
She's got everything a man believes he needs
Another man done been caught
He's always been rough I'm talking barroom tough
He always said he'd never fall in love
Another man done been caught
Another man done been caught
When I woke up this morning
Till I fell out on the floor
The whiskey won the battle
But your memory won the war
And I can't figure out
Like an old Hank Williams song
I can't do this anymore
The whiskey won the battle
But your memory won the war
Knowing she's with you
For your memory I got to lose
When I woke up this morning
Till I just fell out on the floor
The whiskey won the battle
But your memory won the war
It means through thick and thin and
And you'll see a picture of that piece of trash
But you'll need boots to wade through all the bull
You tell me when you come home drunk
It's just like you to be so clueless
Cause you never thought I'd do this
It's what you call me and it's how you act
Every time I call your bluff
It's what Jesus has in store for you
But I don't no matter what
But sorry is as sorry does
Well the sooner the better for me
Dang sure will make you be all that you can be
You tore me down piece by piece
But believe me there's plenty of me left.
But it's only made me strong
I suggest you do what I've done
That I'm not after anything less
Let me refresh your memory one last time.
Have you ever rode a dirt road with the windows rolled down
Smelling that honeysuckle vine
A house but every few miles
That's where country grows
It's in the hearts of those who know what life's all about
And you know He'll forgive you for the wrong you've done
That's where country grows
Have you ever seen a young boy open up the door
Or a shoe polish heart on a second hand car
Have you ever heard a mama cry saying goodbye
That's where country grows
It's in the hearts of those who know what life's all about
You bow your head to Jesus cause He's where it all comes from
And you know He'll forgive you for the wrong you've done
That's where country grows
You bow your head to Jesus cause He's where it all comes from
In the end He'll forgive us for the wrong we've done
That's where country grows
That's where country grows
Have you ever heard a song that changed your life
Coming through the radio
I guess I'm just a woman
And that's why I feel the way I do
Sometimes I wanna hold you tight
And other times I wanna yell at you
And sometimes I'm happy
Proud as I can be feeling glad
And sometimes I wanna cry
Because I feel so sad
And I guess I'm just a woman
And that's what women do
We carry the weight of the world on our shoulders
Making sure every little thing goes through
And I know you're doing all you can
And I know that after all
But you should understand
That I am just a woman
I guess I'm just a woman
And certain things stand out to me
See I worry when you treat me like a stranger
But you greet the stranger on the street
And there's bills on the table
And I am a banker you would think
When you're a mama and a wife
There ain't many things you ain't
Yes I am just a woman
And that's what women do
We carry the weight of the world on our shoulders
Making sure every little thing goes through
And I know you're doing all you can
And I know that after all
But you should understand
That I am just a woman
I need you to understand
Pulled up the roots that his Daddy laid down
Country boy thought he'd try the city life
I won fifty bucks off of Bobby's little sister
He had to come back to the place he loves
Just a bunch of fence and pasture
Grain elevators and a couple old tractors
Where there's more cows than people
I saw on the news where the interstate
To make this a better place to live
Just a bunch of fence and pastures
Grain elevators and a couple old tractors
Just a bunch of fence and pasture
Grain elevators and a couple old tractors
Just a bunch of fence and pasture
Grain elevators and a couple old tractors
Let's see how many people we can fit inside it
I think we've got half of the town invited
For some beer on a boat on a Saturday
The world looks better through a cool pair of shades
With some beer on a boat on a Saturday
Got the girls on the inner tube
And if you ain't wet yet
Then Buddy's gonna get you with a belly flop
Some beer on a boat on a Saturday
The world looks better through a cool pair of shades
With some beer on a boat on a Saturday
Wouldn't be all bad if we all ran out of gas and got stuck here
With some ice cold beer on a boat on a Saturday
The world looks better through a cool pair of shades
With some beer on a boat on a Saturday
In a thousand things I need to do
He's had a wake of perfect weather
He knows it won't last forever
Rainbows today are gone tomorrow
We've seen our share of downpours
Rainbows today are gone tomorrow
But me and Saturday night we always wake up together
But my friends are at the river and it's real pretty weather
Maybe I can make it Wednesday night
And I reckon I'm gonna have to fight
But me and Saturday night we always wake up together
Cause you ain't been yourself here lately
And that all leads to one thing
Cause you ain't been yourself here lately
And that all leads to one thing
And a lawyer has been seen
But I wasn't old enough at the time
We'd load up and down the road we'd go
I was fifteen but I thought that I was twenty five
I could go anywhere I wanted to go
I was fifteen but I thought that I was twenty five
I could go anywhere I wanted to go
We're all married now and we have kids
But don't think that we don't look back and remember when
And I could go anywhere I wanted to go
It means through thick and thin and
And you'll see a picture of that piece of trash
But you'll need boots to wade through all the bull
You tell me when you come home drunk
It's just like you to be so clueless
Cause you never thought I'd do this
It's what you call me and it's how you act
Every time I call your bluff
It's what Jesus has in store for you
But I don't no matter what
It started out as a young love that ran wild
Me having the innocence of a child
I was so blind to not see
And in the end you sure did hurt me
Make some sweet memories
We were laying on the river
Blowing through the summer heat
We both ended up alone
What we had it wasn't what I thought it was
Though I felt so completely in love
I told you that I wanted you forever
The same night that you said we couldn't be together
Make some sweet memories
We were laying on the river
Blowing through the summer heat
We both ended up alone
We all live running in a direction
So sure of where we're going
Head set on certain thoughts and conceptions
But what if right now vanished
Just that quick something can happen
You were never thinking
This is my last second to breathe
What if today they laid you in the ground
What if today your redemption's lost or either found
What if today your loved ones wake without you around
Late one autumn evening my brother left
Mama grabbed his arm without reason
And his I won't be long vanished
Just that quick something happened
Was this supposed to be a lesson for me
What if today my redemption's lost or either found
What if today my loved ones wake without me around
We all live running in a direction
We're so sure of where we're going
I'm backwards I guess
This progress ain't that what we call it
It's a far cry from Andy
It's worlds away from a front porch
Pass it down or it's gone
Just roll with the flow
And what that can make us
Ooh we better hang on
Pass it down or it's gone
It's one of them summer days
Where the heat can take your breath
It's one of them summer days that
Leaves you kind of restless
We'll take the babies to your Mama's
We'll hug and kiss them goodnight
And rock each other on a dirt road
Or on a sand bar in the moonlight
We'll let ourselves go back in time
For a minute we will chill
While the world keeps
It's one of them summer days
Makes you wanna go to the river
Forget what you don't wanna remember
Baby I know you wanna do that too
So let's take a moment for me and you
Let me love your pain away
Let me love all your pain away
Come on baby just take my hand
And I'll make you proud God made you a man
I'm gonna love you more tonight than she ever has
I know y'all don't know the way that feels
So tonight let's all have us a good time
Take the load off all our minds
Me and the girls we're about to get rowdy
I'm gonna crank up the Hank break out the drinks
I got a little time off
Gotta make of it all I can
Me and the girls we're about to get rowdy
I'm gonna crank up the
Hank break out the drinks
We'll get a longer road ride
We'll leave all our troubles behind
Me and the girls we're about to get rowdy
I'm gonna crank up the Hank break out the drinks
Me and the girls we're about to get rowdy
I'm gonna crank up the Hank break out the drinks
I said crank up the Hank
We're all the way through
I wanna be all the way over you
I wanna spend just one day
But as soon as your memories leaves
Why would you leave my mind
Can't you just stay where you're at
Ooh ain't you strong and don't you stay with me
You were back and you're forth right when I
Why don't you stay on the other side
The next time you cross my mind
Ain't gonna let you drag me down
For my night on the town
Just like I knew you would
Ooh ain't you strong and don't you stay with me
You were back and you're forth right when I
So why don't you stay on the other side
The next time you cross my mind
Why don't you stay on the other side
He walked up to the bar
Ordered up a hard shot like always
Could sing any song you want on Broadway
But he took to the bottle
The bottle took his hand
He could've been a celebrity
It's sad he didn't make it
If he had won where would he be
Probably not out on the streets
Guitar fills his hands
But he's a very empty man
He choked the wrong way
Though all the locals said he could've had a chance
Now he watches passers by that could've been his fans
He walked up to the bar
Can't get to school on time
Never just enjoy the ride
We don't even have the radio on
Guess I'm stressed in life
Says the bags under my eyes
Is this really what it means to be grown
And on the way back it hit me
So I let down all the windows
I turned up my radio and
I sang to the top of my lungs
I reached out I felt of the wind and
My frown turned into a grin when
I looked back on the places I've been
Could it sound silly I guess
But y'all I'm tired of this mess
Who made these rules I live by
Yesterday I was young
And I didn't even have to try
Do you remember when Friday night stayed on your brain
So I'm gonna let down all the windows
I sang to the top of my lungs
I reached out I felt of the wind and
My frown turned into a grin when
I look back on the person that I've been
We're so happy about how Daddy received it
You bought a ring for you and me and next week
We stood at the county courthouse
And one bath but it'll work
And that's the way it's gonna be
There's a lawyer and a judge and paper
And we just can't see if we do what's right
Put up a fight now there ain't no need to try
It's too late to buy you roses
Preacher says it's time for last respects paid
I lean down and kiss your face
In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the wedding rings
She smiles and nods her head
Golden rings with one tiny little stone
Waiting there for someone to take you home
By itself it's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a little wedding chapel later on that afternoon
An old upright piano played an old familiar tune
Tears roll down her cheeks
As happy thoughts run through her head
Golden ring with one tiny little stone
Shining ring now at last it's found a home
By itself it's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a small two room apartment
As they fight their final round
And throws down the ring
As she walks out the door
Golden ring with one tiny little stone
Cast aside like the love that's dead and gone
By itself it's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the wedding rings
Y'all it's all gonna be okay
So let's wave our hands high
It is a privilege to be standing for the stripes and the stars
And under God we will not lose heart
And that's who we are
Got stickers that say if
There's a lot of men who've
Fought and they died so that
This land that we live in could stay alive
So y'all wave your hands high
If you're thankful for our flag
It is a privilege to be standing for the stripes and the stars
And under God we will not lose heart
God has blessed America
Where's that gal with the red dress on some folks called her Dinah
Stole my heart away from me down in Louisiana
Take me back to Tulsa I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa I'm too young to marry
Little bee sucks the blossom big bee gives the honey
Dark man raise the cotton white man gets the money
Take me back to Tulsa...
Walk and talk to Suzy walk and talk to Suzy
Walk and talk to Suzy walk and talk to Suzy
We always wear a great big smile we never do look sour
Travel all over the country playing by the hour
My sweetheart is gone and I'm so lonely
She said that she and I were through
Every time I think about the booze
Now ever since the day that we parted
I've been so sad and so blue
Every time I think about the booze
There is nothing more I can do
Every time I think about the booze
I had lot's of luck but it's all been bad
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive
My woman run away with another man
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive
A distant uncle passed away and left me quite a batch
A lawyer proved I wasn't born
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive
Are full of holes and nails
And brother if I stepped on a worn out dime
I bet a nickel I could tell you if it was heads or tails
I'm not gonna worry wrinkles in my brow
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive
I could buy a Sunday suit and it would leave me broke
If it had two pair of pants I would burn the coat
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive
I wouldn't have a pocket in my patched up pants
No matter how I struggle and strive
He does an Indian boogie to a white man's song
But he keeps on shaking that tomahawk
He does an Indian boogie to a white man's song
I was invited to a Party
I drank up all of their whiskey
I started chasing some woman around
They threw me out of the back door
But I'm a Hillbilly Nut
I took my Girl to a Dance
The Band was playing Rocking Soul
I asked them if they'd play me a slow one
So me and my Girl could get close
I wanted a song off the jukebox
They act like it never was cut
But I'm a Hillbilly Nut
Today I got a Letter from my Sister
She's asking me when I'll be coming Home
Today I found a bar gone Country
And I'm glad cause the door's never shut
But I'm a Hillbilly Nut
And so I climbed into the cab and then I settled down inside.
He asked me if I'd seen a road with so much dust and sand.
I've been everywhere.
Heading for the station with a pack on my back
Tired of transportation in the back of a hack
Pal around with Democratic fellows named Mack
You need some compensation to get back in the black
You take the morning paper from the top of the stack
And read the situation from the front to the back
The only job that's open needs a man with a knack
Well I'm gonna settle down by the railroad track
And lead the life of Riley in a beaten down shack
And when I hear the whistle I can peep through the crack
Why do you treat me as if I were only a friend
What have I done that has made you so distant and cold
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be contented again
Will you be happy when you are withered and old.
I can't offer you diamonds or mansions so fine
And I can't offer you clothes your young body crave
But if you'd love me and say that you'll always be mine
When you are weary and tired of another man's gold
If you ever get lonesome remember this letter my own
But don't try to answer though I've suffered sorrow untold
Don't ask me why I'm going to Texas
Cause the reason I just don't know
But I've got a little gal down in Houston
And I've got lots of friends in San Antone
Don't ask me why I'm going to Texas
Why in all the world am I here
You can here bob wills bill mack and me on your radio
Don't ask me why I'm going to Texas
It's just the kind of placed where I should be
Yeah there's a lot of room
Beneath that southern moon
You can here bob wills bill mack and me on your radio
Don't ask me why I'm going to Texas
It's just the kind of placed where I should be
Say there's a lot of room
Beneath that Texas moon
I'm gonna be a wheel someday
I'm gonna be somebody
I'm gonna be a real gone cat
And I won't need nobody
I'm gonna be a real gone cat
You gonna wonder why I don't look at you
I'm gonna be a wheel someday
I'm gonna be somebody
I'm gonna be a real gone cat
I'm gonna be a wheel someday
I'm gonna be somebody
I'm gonna be a real gone cat
And I won't need nobody
I'm gonna be a real gone cat
You gonna wonder why I don't look at you
I'm gonna be a wheel someday
I'm gonna be somebody
I'm gonna be a real gone cat
Sure enough don't want you
Now listen dear Miss Molly I've told you this before
Her lips are soft as satin and they taste like gingerbread
And when she laughs her voice is like a little silver bell
If only Miss Molly will say that she'll be mine
She said a woman came by with a letter for you and this is what the letter said
The letter that Johnny Walker read
He was thinking of his wife and little children back home
How his drinking had ruined their lives
Clutching in his hand the letter that Johnny Walker read
So I'm standing in a corner trying to understand
How a sweet girl like you can waste all her time
Running after fools when you could be mine
You're running after fools who don't love you like I do
Why does a cute little lass always look for greener grass
You're running after fools and you won't ever stop
Till there's one as big as you and then you're gonna get caught
Cause a sweet girl like you should not waste all her time
Running after fools when you could be mine
I got orders from my baby
Not to come home juiced no more
I stop by a fence to visit with a friend of mine
I just dropped in for a minute
But I over stayed my time
Don't you come home drunk no more
Why oh why does whiskey
Got me sitting at a bar
When I should be home in bed
I got orders from my baby
Not to come home drunk no more
Yeah whiskey every morning
As long as I got my whiskey
I got orders from my baby
I moved your pictures from my walls
And each new day finds me so blue
I read your letters one by one
And I still love you when it's all said and done
As I write this letter
Oh it's raining on my window pain
And I feel the need of you
So I'll wait until you're home
You're so beautiful but you've got to die someday
You're so beautiful but you've got to die someday
Tonight the bartender is on the wrong side of the bar
I'm working on the night shift in the lonely part of town
Each night a row of faces stare back at me
My mind is on that woman who was the world to me
Tonight I'm as blue as you are
You pour the booze and I'll abuse it
Tonight the bartender is on the wrong side of the bar
When I bump into you we bounce around
I bump into you and then we bounce around
And I bumped into you and we bounced around
Once I stood in the night
With my head bowed low
In the darkness as black as could be
And my heart felt alone and I cried oh Lord
Don't hide your face from me
Like a king I may live in a palace so tall
With great riches to call my own
But I don't know a thing
In this whole wide world
That's worse than being alone
Come here to the great unknown
Where no one stands alone
I'm all alone at midnight
Ain't never had so much
Trouble in my life before.
And if the blues don't leave me
I'll rock away from there.
Cause you to lose your mind.
I'm gonna lay my head down
On some lonesome railroad line
And let the two nineteen
Well if you ever plan to motor west
Just take my way that's the highway that's the best
Get your kicks on Route 66
More than two thousand miles all the way
Get your kicks on Route 66
Well goes from St. Louie down to Missouri
Oklahoma city looks oh so pretty
Would you get hip to this kindly tip
And go take that California trip
Get your kicks on Route 66
Well goes from St. Louie down to Missouri
Oklahoma city looks oh so pretty
Would you get hip to this kindly tip
And go take that California trip
I saw miles and miles of Texas all the stars up in the sky
I saw miles and miles of Texas gonna live here till I die
Just ask any cowboy he'll tell you it's the best
I looked in to her big blue eyes this is what I saw
I saw miles and miles of Texas all the stars up in the sky
I saw miles and miles of Texas gonna live here till I die
He threw me from the saddle and this is what I saw
I saw miles and miles of Texas all the stars up in the sky
I saw miles and miles of Texas gonna live here till I die
Gonna live here till I die
The queen of the delta land
Then you'll understand
Why I've got the blues for Dixie
If you've ever been to Tennessee
When that old cotton field is white
Then you've had the blues for Dixie
If you've seen the glamor of that Alabama
If you've got a baby in Birmingham maybe
Then you'll know the reason why
There goes that train
If you've seen the glamor of that Alabama
If you've got a baby in Birmingham maybe
Then you'll know the reason why
Say child have you seen the Bourbon Street queen
She's feeling it revealing it down in New Orleans that
Dance dance dance little stripper dance while the music's
She's got what it takes to drive you insane
She'll show you things like you ain't never seen that
So dance dance dance little stripper...
She doesn't undress like all of the rest
She kicks off her shoes when she feels the blues the
So dance dance dance little stripper...
Tell her that I said to let her hair hang down and show
If you could be so kind
To help me find my mind
I'd like to thank you in advance
Know this before you start
My soul's been torn apart
I lost my mind in a wild romance
It's memory will last
I'll live to love the days gone by
Each day that comes and goes
Is like the one before
Words would fail me if I tried to describe him
Though I know he's not what he should have been
He was the Devil with the face of an angel
If you could be so kind
To help me find my mind
I'd like to thank you in advance
Know this before you start
And my soul's been torn apart
I lost my mind in a wild romance
Words would fail me if I tried to describe him
Though I know he's not what he should have been
He was the Devil with the face of an angel
If you could be so kind
To help me find my mind
I'd like to thank you in advance
Know this before you start
And my soul's been torn apart
I lost my mind in a wild romance
I lost my mind in a wild romance
I took your love and you took mine
We shared some good things for quite some time
But now you know as well as I
We've gone as far as we can go
We had the chance to make love last
But we both let that chance slip past
And now you know as well as I
We've gone as far as we can go
There ain't a thing to be ashamed of
When you give love like we gave
The only thing I am ashamed of
Is we lost the love we had the chance to save
I would stay but I believe
Even then love would leave
We can't go on without goodbye
We've gone as far as we can go
We've gone as far as we can go
Every time I'm near you my heart jumps all about
My mind can't figure out what to do
But I've been disillusioned enough by love turned blue
Your love could be true but I wonder
Am I supposed to think your love will be true
And deny the part of me that says you'll leave me too
Cause yesterday reminds me that what I've lost is gone
Your love may linger on but I wonder
I heard all your stories they ring well in my ears
But raise certain fears and doubts
Cause yesterday reminds me that what I've lost is gone
Your love may linger on but I wonder
Folks all seem to drift on by
Tell me true friend am I high
Or have my legs been rubberized
Tell me true friend am I high
Was it that gage that incited my rage
Or was it the booze that got me so confused
Perhaps that cocaine caused me to exclaim
As I fell to the floor give me more give more
If you could see them from the other side
It's 3 am in the morning that train whistle is blowing
It sounds like some lonesome song got in my soul
She makes a whistle stop then she's gone again
My baby thinks she's a train
Drags me round like an old caboose
I'm telling you boys that's girl's insane
My baby thinks she's a train
It's the noise that you hear when my baby hits town
What you supposed to do when your baby thinks she's a train
She eats money like a train eats coal
She burns it up and leaves you in the smoke
You came back this morning
The sun was coming up
You came back this morning
The sun was coming up
My pretty little poppy
My heart is wrapped around you
And loving you it seems to beat a rhapsody
The pretty little poppy
Must copy its endearing charm from you
What has happened down here is the wind have changed
Clouds roll in from the north and it started to rain
Rained real hard and rained for a real long time
Six feet of water in the streets of Evangeline
President Coolidge come down in a railroad train
At the end of the day when it comes down to one decision
Dead beat girls and freaks at a peoples convention
All these sugars with no vitamin sensation
Do you ever stop to look over old relations
Or look to the belly of another one's emotions
Someone young in the winds of a revolution
Trying to save his face in the evolution
But you know that the streets
He's kept alive in the chain of mental starvation
Unlike you who seem bred from corruption
But you know that the streets
With a lover in the street whose waiting to make a connection
To be the mother to the soul of your next abortion
She'll steal your money with the eyes of a baby's complexion
Then she'll laugh at you and your sexual invention
Devoted the heat of a spotlight in motion
With a face full of mud even though you were only joking
As if you really understood the value of isolation
But you know that the streets
Every engine burns as a sign of the explosion
Locked in neutral your engines are broken
Like candle wax that sun melts into the ocean
Like the moon that lights the tracks of the old train station
You can color in the lines of the Mother Earth's addictions
And not hold a gun in the face of the Earth's abduction
But you know that the streets
At the end of the day when it comes down to one decision
Locked up the barnyard with the greatest of care
And to the hen house something stirred
This is what he heard
There ain't nobody here but us chickens
Ain't nobody here at all
There ain't nobody here but us
He kindly point that gun the other way
There ain't nobody here but us chickens
Ain't nobody here at all
You're kicking up an awful dust
There ain't nobody here but us chickens
So quiet yourself stop all that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us
He kindly point that gun the other way
Well tomorrow is a busy day
And ain't nobody here but us roosters
So quiet yourself and stop all that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us
And kindly point that gun the other way
Hey boss man now what you say
Across the alley from the Alamo
Lived a pinto pony and a Navajo
And the Navajo watched the lazy skies
And very rarely did they ever rest their eyes
When the summer sun decides to settle low
To the people passing by
Across the alley from the Alamo
Lived a pinto pony and a Navajo
For the people passing by
They thought that they would make some easy bucks
A pair of very conscientious clucks
When the starlight beams its tender glow
The beams go to sleep and then there ain't no dough
When the summer sun decides to settle low
You call us heathens with zero respect for the law
We are only songwriters just writing our songs and that's all
We write what we live and we live what we write is that wrong
If you think it is Mr. Music Executive
Why don't you write your own songs
They might make you dwell on your feelings a moment too long
We're making you rich and you're already lazy
So just lay on your ass and get richer or write your own songs
Mr. Purified Country don't you know what the whole things about
Is your head up your ass so far that you can't pull it out
The world's getting smaller and everyone in it belongs
And if you can't see that Mr. Purified Country
Why don't you just write your own songs
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
If It hadn't Been For Cotton Eyed Joe
I'd Been Married a long Time Ago
Where did you come from where did you go
He brought a disaster wherever he went
They all ran away so nobody would know
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
He brought disaster wherever he went
They all ran away so nobody would know
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
Well it takes more than a robin to make the winter go
And it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow
And baby you've got what it takes
Yeah it takes a lot of woman to knock me off of my feet
And baby you've got what it takes
Yeah I said mm mm mm ah ah mm mm mm
You know honey you've got just what it takes
It takes more than an effort to stay away from you
And it'd take more than a lifetime yeah to prove that I'll be true
Well it takes somebody special to make me say I do
And baby you've got what it takes
You know honey you've got just what it takes
Because it takes more than an effort
I'm drifting into deep water
I'm starting to care for you
And you're getting me in deep water
Be careful of what you do
You want a romance but I'm sick in love
I know I'll regret it when it ends
I'm winding up in deep water
It's restless in this deep water
I'm lost between right and wrong
My love is true as deep water
Your love won't last as long
I can't help but wish I only knew
I'm winding up in deep water
Now you've finally learned
Ain't nobody around this town that's gonna mis me anyway
Way down Texas way they play good music every night
And the dance hall rings with laughter till the early morning light
The road of life is paved with good intentions I am told
So I best be on my way now or I may not ever go
Way down Texas way they play fiddle music every night
And the dance hall rings with laughter till the early morning light
There's a detour sign on the road that winds
Out on the broad highway
But the place for me is the sign I see
T U L S A straight ahead
T U L S A straight ahead
I'm gonna settle down when I reach that city fair
I'm homeward bound and I know I'll soon be there
Where the tall corn grows and the black all flows
In the middle of it all I hear the call
T U L S A straight ahead
I'm gonna settle down when I reach that city fair
I'm homeward bound and I know I'll soon be there
If there's is no other way
It's not just the bedroom where she used to lay her head
Or the front room by the fire where we once passed the night instead
Though I have left these rooms and gone as far as I could drive
Even in the motels along U S 405
Coast to coast and wall to wall
It's a memory not much more than five feet tall
But the shadow that it's casting seem to fall
Coast to coast and wall to wall
California seems like someplace I could catch my breath
Get my mind off someone who still worries me to death
Even though she's gone her memory unlocks every door
Lace up your boots and we'll truck on down
To a knocked out shack on the edge of town
There's an eight beat combo that just won't quit
Fall in there and we'll see some sights
Down at the house the house the house of blue lights
But the treat of the treat
Is when they serve up those fine egg beats
You'll wanna spend the rest of your brights
Down at the house the house the house of blue lights
We'll have a time and we'll some rug
While we dig those tunes like they should be dug
Just boogie past the welcome mat
Fall in there and we'll see some sights
Down at the house the house the house of blue lights
But the treat of the treat
Is when they serve up those fine egg beats
You'll wanna spend the rest of your brights
Shades of gray out on the ocean
Don't you dare take that boat out to sea
You will sure enough be done in
If you dare take that boat out to sea
If you dare take that boat out to sea
You better not make one more drag
Or you may wind up in a bag
If you dare take that boat out to sea
Shades of gray out on the ocean
With the pedal to the metal watch me roll on by
I'm gonna make it to Kentucky
Oklahoma city's just a memory
All aboard track twenty nine can you give me a shine
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
There's gonna be a certain party in the station
Satin and lace I used to call funny face
She's gonna cry when I tell her that I'll never roam
All aboard you afford
Ah shucks well I wouldn't stop for a million bucks
I love you so just hold me tight and don't let go
And that Model A body makes it look like a pup.
Got overdrive that just won't stall.
The brakes are good and the tires fair.
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
So I thought I'd make that Lincoln unwind.
I shoved it on down into overdrive.
My speedometer said that I'd hit top end.
And them telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
The lines on the road just looked like dots.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
I knew I could catch him and I thought I could pass
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln.
Well they arrested me and put me in jail.
They called my pappy to throw my bail.
Let's go down to Alabama
Let's go see my dear old mama
She's got baked ribs and candied yams
Basement full of those berry jams
And that's what I like about the South
Ham hocks and turnip greens
Down where the trees grow tall
Where everybody says y'all
Walk on in with that Southern drawl
And that's what I like about the South
Here comes old Parson with all the news
Box back coat and button shoes
All paid up with his union dues
But it ain't no town and it ain't no city
It's awful small but it's mighty pretty
I'm not here to sympathize
But don't tell me them no good lies
Every time I pass your door
You act like you don't want me no more
You just raise your head and sigh
Work like the devil for my pay
But the lucky old sun has nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day
While the lucky old sun has nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day
Good Lord above can't you know I'm pining
Send down that cloud with a silver lining
Wash all my troubles away
Like the lucky old sun give me nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day
Good Lord above can't you know I'm pining
Send down that cloud with a silver lining
Wash all my troubles away
Like the lucky old sun give me nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day
If I see you tomorrow on some street in town
Pardon me if I don't say hello
To know someone I'm not supposed to know.
In a dimly lit corner in a place outside of town
Tonight we'll try to say goodbye again
Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit path that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor knows only my heart
Still live in my heart all alone
And that moonlit pass beside the Alamo
Hungry every minute of the day
As long as he can chew it it's okay
He can eat an apple pie and never even bat an eye
He likes anything from soup to hay
I bet he's going to be a man some day
Bread and jelly twenty times a day
He needs lots strength to sing and play
He's up at dawn to do the chores
Runs both ways to all the stores
He works up an appetite that way
Meet my baby and tell her the news
I bet my bundle on a swayback nag
And I came home winner with a plenty of swag
Do a little jig and a zig and a zag
One's for my honey and the other is mine
Sip on the cider and sip on the wine
They both sip together and a have a good time
Do a little jig and a zig and a zag
I'm gonna spend all my money and a git on a jag
Walk right up and stomp on the floor
And swing up the middle with a shoofly four
Do a little jig and a zig and a zag
Do a little jig and a zig and a zag
I'm walking the floor over you I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
You left me and you went away
You said that you'd be back in just a day
You've broken your promise and you left me here alone
I don't know why you did dear but I do know that you're gone
I'm walking the floor over you...
Well someday you may be lonesome too
Walking the floor is good for you
Just keep right on walking and it won't hurt your pride
Remember that I loved you and I will to the day I die
I'm walking the floor over you...
It's 3 am in the morning that train whistle is blowing
It sounds like some lonesome song got in my soul
She makes a whistle stop then she's gone again

You don't have to go to Memphis to get the Blues
You just fall in love with the kind of women I do
You don't have to go to Memphis to get the Blues
Watching good love slip away
Love has come and gone
You don't have to go to Memphis to get the Blues
You just fall in love with the kind of women I do
Well I've had me a dozen but I never had me one that
You don't have to go to Memphis to get the Blues
Where I'm at is lost again
You don't have to go to Memphis to get the Blues
You just fall in love with the kind of women I do
You don't have to go to Memphis to get the Blues
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far
He can play piano any way that you like it
But the way he likes to play is eight to the bar
He's the daddy of them all
The people gather around when he gets on the stand
The rhythm he beats puts the cats in a trance
Nobody there bothers to dance
But when he plays with the bass and guitar
And when he plays with the bass and guitar
That when he plays he puts them all in a trance
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far
When he plays with the bass and guitar
The people gather around when he gets up on the stand
The rhythm that he plays puts the cats in a trance
Nobody there ever bothers to dance
But when he plays with the bass and guitar
But when he plays with the bass and guitar
I eat so much I could nearly die
I'm drifting into deep water
I'm starting to care for you
And you're getting me in deep water
Be careful of what you do
You want a romance but I'm sick in love
I know I'll regret it when it ends
I'm winding up in deep water
It's restless in this deep water
I'm lost between right and wrong
My love is true as deep water
Your love won't last as long
I can't help but wish I only knew
I'm winding up in deep water
The queen of the delta land
Then you'll understand
Why I've got the blues for Dixie
If you've ever been to Tennessee
When that old cotton field is white
Then you've had the blues for Dixie
If you've seen the glamor of that Alabama
If you've got a baby in Birmingham maybe
Then you'll know the reason why
There goes that train
If you've seen the glamor of that Alabama
If you've got a baby in Birmingham maybe
Then you'll know the reason why

The beams go to sleep and then there ain't no dough
When the summer sun decides to settle low
There's a pretty sofa and that ain't all
If I'm not mistaken I sure am right
Somebody else in the parlor tonight
Y'all in a girdle like you was awhile ago
My old mistress promised me
That when she died she'd set me free
But she lived so long that her head got bald
Took the the notion not to die at all
Somebody said it's time to go
Don't forget to come back Saturday night
Wondering what time you came to me
You broke my heart and left lonely
Now I got nothing left but misery
Wondering if you have found another love
Brings no consolation to my heart
Now one of these days you'll be sorry
That you filled my heart with misery
One of these days you'll be sorry
That you filled my heart with misery
It's so hard to realize we're through
Now I wonder if you feel the way I do
I'll never forget our days together
Even though I know they're very few
I loved you then and will forever
And I wonder if you feel the way I do
Yeah it's the same thing
That two people ever knew
You told me that I need not worry
That forever you'd be true
My thoughts will always be with you
Corrina can you dance with me
Corrina can you dance with me
Corrina can you dance
Just a little more loving let your heart be true
That you're growing colder more and more every day
Corrina can you dance with me
Corrina can you dance with me
Corrina can you dance with me
Corrina can you dance with me
Corrina can you dance
Well I left Corrina far across the sea
I left Corrina way across the sea
She wouldn't talk to me
Corrina can you dance with me
Corrina can you dance with me
Corrina can you dance with me
Corrina can you dance with me
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas
From the bottom of my heart
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas
From the bottom of my heart
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas
From the bottom of my heart
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas
From the bottom of my heart
Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
A moonlit path that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor knows only my heart
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
Hungry every minute of the day
As long as he can chew it it's okay
He can eat an apple pie and never even bat an eye
He likes anything from soup to hay
I bet he's going to be a man some day
Bread and jelly twenty times a day
He needs lots strength to sing and play
He's up at dawn to do the chores
Runs both ways to all the stores
He works up an appetite that way
One night when the moon was bright on a moonlit plain
That is where I met my little Cherokee maid
Memories of our night of love still linger yet
And I know I never will forget
Even thought we're far apart
For anybody else's heart
Someday day I'll take a trip back to the Cherokee strip
And I'll carry her away with me and
Straight as the arrow flies we'll ride to paradise
One night when the moon was bright on a moonlit plain
That is where I met my little Cherokee maid
Memories of our night of love still linger yet
And I know I never will forget
Even thought we're far apart
For anybody else's heart
Someday day I'll take a trip back to the Cherokee strip
And I'll carry her away with me and
Straight as the arrow flies we'll ride to paradise
Pardon me stranger I hope there's no danger
You'll think I'm getting off of my range
Oh but I calculate that you're from my state
And though you may think it's strange
I allow as how you're from Texas
Because the lingo I understand
I'll bet my kale that you hail from Texas
There's no mistaking the brand
You've got a smile like an acre of sunflowers
Your eyes are blue bonnet blue
Shake hands it's grand that you're from Texas
You've got a smile like an acre of sunflowers
Your eyes are blue bonnet blue
Shake hands it's grand that you're from Texas
Right or wrong I'll always love you
Though you're gone I can't forget
Right or wrong I'll keep on dreaming
Still I wake with that same old regret
And all along I thought I'd lose you
And still I prayed that you'd be true
In your heart please just remember
Right or wrong I'm still in love with you
Though you're gone I can't forget
Right or wrong I'll keep on dreaming
And all along I thought I'd lose you
As I look at the letters that you wrote to me
It's you that I am thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love
I miss you darling more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded love
As I think of the past and all the pleasures we had
As I watch the mating of the dove
It was in the springtime when you said goodbye
I remember our faded love
I miss you darling more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
Where's that gal with the red dress on some folks called her Dinah
Stole my heart away from me down in Louisiana
Take me back to Tulsa I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa I'm too young to marry
Little bee sucks the blossom big bee gives the honey
Dark man raise the cotton white man gets the money
Take me back to Tulsa...
Walk and talk to Suzy walk and talk to Suzy
Walk and talk to Suzy walk and talk to Suzy
We always wear a great big smile we never do look sour
Travel all over the country playing by the hour
Where you tip your hats to the ladies and the rose of San Antone
I grew up on music that we called western swing
To hear the Texas playboys and Tommy Duncan sing
Makes me proud to be from Texas where Bob Wills is still the king
It's the home of country music on that we all agree
That you just can't live in Texas unless you got a lot of soul
I saw miles and miles of Texas all the stars up in the sky
I saw miles and miles of Texas gonna live here till I die
Just ask any cowboy he'll tell you it's the best
I looked in to her big blue eyes this is what I saw
I saw miles and miles of Texas all the stars up in the sky
I saw miles and miles of Texas gonna live here till I die
He threw me from the saddle and this is what I saw
I saw miles and miles of Texas all the stars up in the sky
I saw miles and miles of Texas gonna live here till I die
Gonna live here till I die
Well if you ever plan to motor west
Just take my way that's the highway that's the best
Get your kicks on Route 66
More than two thousand miles all the way
Get your kicks on Route 66
Well goes from St. Louie down to Missouri
Oklahoma city looks oh so pretty
Would you get hip to this kindly tip
And go take that California trip
Get your kicks on Route 66
Well goes from St. Louie down to Missouri

Please don't be so slow

I wanna six pack to go
But I ain't gonna worry though
I've got time for one more round
Please don't be so slow
I've got time for one more round
I wanna six pack to go
I've done spent my whole paycheck
But I ain't gonna worry though
We've done spent our whole paycheck
We've got time for one more round
If he brings you happiness
Then I wish you all the best
But it he ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To drive away every teardrop that you cried
If he ever leaves you blue
It's 3 am in the morning that train whistle is blowing
It sounds like some lonesome song got in my soul
She makes a whistle stop then she's gone again
My baby thinks she's a train

Oklahoma city's just a memory
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago

Where did you come from where did you go
He brought a disaster wherever he went
They all ran away so nobody would know
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
He brought disaster wherever he went
They all ran away so nobody would know
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
A moonlit path that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor knows only my heart
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
Across the alley from the Alamo
Lived a pinto pony and a Navajo
And the Navajo watched the lazy skies
And very rarely did they ever rest their eyes
When the summer sun decides to settle low
To the people passing by
Across the alley from the Alamo
Lived a pinto pony and a Navajo
For the people passing by
They thought that they would make some easy bucks
A pair of very conscientious clucks
When the starlight beams its tender glow
The beams go to sleep and then there ain't no dough
When the summer sun decides to settle low
In the Texas town of San Antonio
Is a little church they call the Alamo
The story tellers say Ozzy Osborne stopped one day
All dressed up in women's lingerie
I don't know if the guy was drinking beer
Jack or beam it's not exactly clear
But when he whipped it out
The ghost of Travis gave a shout
Whose message all good Texans still can hear
You really shouldn't go there
It's a source of Texas pride
You really shouldn't go there
You'll really piss us off if you go there
When Bowie and Young Crockett made their stand
Colonel Travis drew a line in to the sand
But it's simply not the same when you try and write your name
That bloody rocker must have mush for brains
You really shouldn't go there
It's a simple Texas mission
Not a pot for you to piss in
You really shouldn't go there
You'll really piss us off if you go there
Music never rilled us
The groupies or the jets
The show on television
Or the ratings you might get
The thing that drove us plum insane
Was when you drained that old main vain
Took your snake and let it go
The eyes of Texas are upon you
You really shouldn't go there
It's a symbol of our state
Not a place to urinate
You really shouldn't go there
You'll really piss us off if you go there
You really shouldn't go there
You really shouldn't go there
You'll really piss us off if you go there
So I couldn't get out
And there was this old wall and I thinking
He works 24 hours a day
He works 24 hours a day
I think he does it just for spite
He works 24 hours a day
He works 24 hours a day
You know if silence was golden
You couldn't raise a dime
You know if talk was criminal
You'd lead a life of crime
You know that life is short
Just grin and bear it
All I can say is if the shoe fits wear it
Please try to make it rhyme
I was just a man and you were my lover
Glad that I was yours and you were mine
For awhile I could do no wrong.
You laughed at my jokes and you danced to the song
I said if we could just stay together.
It could be just like this forever
Finer things in life we would enjoy
You told me you thought that I was wrong
Ya said our love wouldn't last too long
I don't want to leave you all alone
So should I stay or should I go back home
Am I right or Amarillo
Do I stay here with you or hit the road
Am I right or Amarillo
I love you but I can always go back home
Now pretty soon it was just like I figured.
Ya told me that you'd reconsidered
Now it seems there's a brand new problem.
I've learned about as much as I can stand
Now I'm the one who thinks that I was wrong
I don't think our love is gonna last too long
I really really really hate to leave you all alone
Am I right or Amarillo
Do I stay here with you or hit the road
Am I right or Amarillo
I love you but I can always go back home
Now It might be as flat as a pancake.
But how much heartache can one man take
Waiting on an eight o'clock train
Things ain't been quite the same
I gotta get on up to Dallas
And tie up a few loose ends
Gotta work a week make a hundred dollars
Get on the road again
So I don't want you to think
That you're the first one
To leave me out here on my own
Cause this ain't gonna be the first time
Now I've been a fool but a bigger fool I can't remember when I've been
Just to open up my heart
And let you walk right in
Now there's one thing in this life
It ain't hard for me to do
As soon as I kiss the lips of another woman
I'm gonna forget all about you
So I don't want you to think
That you're the first one
To leave me out here on my own
No this ain't gonna be the first time
If you wrote all the woman's names down I know
And let me pick one out
There wouldn't be one in the whole darn bunch
I'd give a hoot about
So I don't want you to think
That you're the first one
Cause this ain't gonna be the first time
No this ain't gonna be the first time
But my legs ain't bowed and my cheeks ain't tan
I'm a cowboy who never saw a cow
I'm a riding fool who is up to date
I know every trail in the Lone Star State
And we come to town just to hear the band
We know all the songs that the cowboys know
We learned them all on the radio
Wondering what time you came to me
You broke my heart and left lonely
Now I got nothing left but misery
Wondering if you have found another love
Brings no consolation to my heart
Now one of these days you'll be sorry
That you filled my heart with misery
One of these days you'll be sorry
That you filled my heart with misery
Well I like my women like I like my coffee in the morning and steaming hot
I ain't impressed with a pretty dress but a smile can knock me flat
I like my women like I like my whiskey at night and over 25
I ain't impressed with a partial dress or a bank account that's fat
I ain't impressed with a pretty dress no but a smile can knock me flat
Now if you've ever been down to New Orleans
Then you can understand just what I mean
You don't have to pay the usual admission
Stop in at the Saturday Night Fish Fry
Now my buddy and me was on the main stem
We decided we could use a little something to eat
So we went to a house on Rampart Street
We knocked on the door and it opened up with ease
And before we could even bat an eye
We were right in the middle of a big fish fry
Over in the corner was a beat up grand
Being played by a big fat piano man
Some of the chicks wore expensive frocks
But everybody was nice and high
At this particular Saturday Night Fish Fry
And way up above all the noise they made
But somebody reached up and hit me on the jaw
They had us blocked off from the front to the back
I knew I could get away if I had a chance
Now I tried to crawl under a bathtub
Now they got us out of there like a house afire
Put us all in that Black Maria
But they got poor me and my buddy too
We headed for jail in a dazed condition
They booked each one of us on suspicion
Now my chick came down and went for my bail
And finally got me out of that rotten jail
Now if you ever want to get a fist in your eye
Just mention a Saturday night fish fry
I don't care how many fish in the sea
But don't ever mention a fish to me
You're my sugar but you're never sweet to me
Now you are my one and only
The only one I've kissed
That price book in your pocket
Well I took you to a nightclub
Just to have a bang up time
You're my sugar but you're never sweet to me.
I bought you fancy collars
Right from that catalog
Did you like those ties I bought
Just like a hangman's knot
You're my sugar but you're never sweet to me
That diamond ring I bought ya
Honey it was nothing but the best
But you only paid a dollar down
And I had to pay the rest
Then what happened to that fur coat
That I bought the other day
Well that new fur coat you bought me
Just got up and walked away
You're my sugar but you're never sweet to me
I knitted you some golf socks
With fancy heels and toes
I promised you a pony
And I promised you a yacht
You're my sugar but you're never sweet to me
Been at it most my life
Well the way we always get along
We should be man and wife
Tied all around his neck
He climbed up on the garage
That the whole thing come unwound
He's headed for the ground
Is just a leap of faith
Spread your arms and hold your breath
And always trust your cape
Tied all around his dreams
And he's full of spit and vinegar
It's gonna be do or die
He was pretty sure he could fly
Is just a leap of faith
Spread your arms and hold your breath
And always trust your cape
Tied all around his head
And will be till he's dead
All these years the people said
He did not know he could not fly
Is just a leap of faith
Spread your arms and hold your breath
And always trust your cape
Is just a leap of faith
Spread your arms and hold your breath
I remember the smell of the creosote plant
When we'd have to eat on Easter with my crazy old uncle and aunt
And the winds would blow across the old bayou
And I was a tranquil little child
Life was just a tire swing
And I never knew a thing about pain
Life was just a tire swing
In a few summers my folks packed me off to camp
And in a few days Baxter went home and he left me by myself
And I could get along without any help
Life was just a tire swing
And I never knew a thing about pain
Life was just a tire swing
And I never been west of New Orleans or east of Pensacola
My only contact with the outside world was an RCA Victoria
And Elvis would sing and then I'd dream about expensive cars
And who would've figured twenty years later
Life was just a tire swing
I fell asleep at the wheel
And I knew that I had survived
And life is still a tire swing
But I finally learned a lot about pain
There is nothing that is wrong
In wanting you to stay here with me.
And don't you ever leave.
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you.
The sun ain't nearly on the rise
And we still got the moon and stars above.
And don't you ever leave.
I long to see the morning light
Coloring your face so dreamily.
You can lay your worries down and stay with me.
With a lot of jingle bells jingling on his sleigh
Bobby wants a pair of skates and a set of cowboy guns
Santa's got his reindeer waiting and will soon be on his way
Bobby wants a pair of skates and a set of cowboy guns
Santa's got his reindeer waiting and will soon be on his way
Won't you ride in my little red wagon
I'd love to pull you down the street
I'll bet all the kids will be jealous
When they see my playmate so sweet
Hold tight till we come to the hilltop
Won't you ride in my little red wagon
And look her in the eye
And if you think your life is still worth saving
And you know your sick and tired of always caving
And let the wind be at your back
Blow away the guilt that makes you hold her
Just listen to that angel on your shoulder
And look her in the eye
And if you think your life is still worth saving
Hanging on the promises of the songs of yesterday.
Here I go ah... gain.
I've done a bad thing it's okay
I'm going down to the river today
And the river's gonna wash my sins away
Till I'm born again tomorrow
Oh to get over my head
Make me forget my sorrow
I'm going down to the river alone
Don't tell mama and daddy I'm gone
And if they cry when I don't come home
Whoa to get out of my eyes
And if it weren't for him and the love that night
I'd be living for the light like a good girl should
I can't speak the trouble I'm in
So if I don't come back again
Go lie beneath the willow
Is where my soul will remain
And if it weren't for him and the love that night
I'd be living for the light like a good girl should
When I meet the Lord so kind
I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind
My daddy won't look in my eyes
Momma knows the lies I'm living
And if it weren't for him and the love that night
I'd be living for the light like a good girl should
He's breathing in time
With a heart that is longing
But he knows he can't
For some sense of belonging.
She looks to the moon
As her tear drops are falling.
Knowing well that she'll
Holding on to glimmer of hope
Every night while he's calling.
Till he's no longer trying.
She was listening but
Sells coal and marigolds and he cries out all down the day
Would I could afford to buy my love a fine robe
Made of gold and silk Arabian thread
She is dead and gone and lying in a pine grove
And I must push my barrow all the day
And I must push my barrow all the day
They laid his body down in a churchyard
He calls down the day
Would I could afford to buy my love a fine gown
Made of gold and silk Arabian thread
But I am dead and gone and lying in a church ground
But still I push my barrow all the day
So I push my barrow all the day
Spent for a beer he's drinking
Won by a gambler's lust
Pierced by an outlaw's bullet
And lost in the blood red dust
Love is a shining dollar
Bright as a church bell's chime
And lost in a dart of time
And seven odd days later
In the First Battle of Bull Run.
And the letter read...
Heaven is sending you
Do not mourn me dead.
For we shall meet again.
My love for you is deathless.
So if my love of country
Heaven is sending you
Do not mourn me dead.
For we shall meet again.
Heaven is sending you
Heaven is sending you
My face as white as snow.
But I won't sell my wool to buy no shack.
I know it gets much colder when you let some shepherd sheer it off your back.
No shepherd man alive can grow the wool that gets him paid.
They'll tell you I am...
When I was a little girl
Is a poor man tomorrow.
And cover shots on magazines
Every answer came to me like
Pictures of my memories
Is a poor man tomorrow.
Is a poor man tomorrow.
Barbie Dolls and lemonade
I've done a bad thing it's okay
I'm going down to the river today
And the river's gonna wash my sins away
Till I'm born again tomorrow
Oh to get over my head
Make me forget my sorrow
I'm going down to the river alone
Don't tell mama and daddy I'm gone
And if they cry when I don't come home
Whoa to get out of my eyes
And if it weren't for him and the love that night
I'd be living for the light like a good girl should
I can't speak the trouble I'm in
So if I don't come back again
Go lie beneath the willow
Is where my soul will remain
And if it weren't for him and the love that night
I'd be living for the light like a good girl should
When I meet the Lord so kind
I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind
My daddy won't look in my eyes
Momma knows the lies I'm living
And if it weren't for him and the love that night
I'd be living for the light like a good girl should
I heard about the venom
The rain cried down the windows
Just then a gray haired woman
Sat down right next to me
You need the snake bite.
You got to get that venom
In your veins and come alive.
I know just what you go through
But I can make it right
She handed me a map with streets
I went to some back alley
Behind a liquor store.
If someone had told me
I never would've opened the door.
Evil ones who want to ensnare
The heavy hearted into their webs
And all my hair is gray.
I don't remember my own name.
I'd go and hurt that woman
But my heart is weak.
Do you imagine you're
Of love set to motion.
You left me no choice.
For love's impatient belief.
And leave you blind to me.
For love's impatient belief
And leave you blind to me.
For love's impatient believe
And leave you blind to me
He's breathing in time
With a heart that is longing
But he knows he can't
For some sense of belonging.
She looks to the moon
As her tear drops are falling.
Knowing well that she'll
Holding on to glimmer of hope
Every night while he's calling.
Till he's no longer trying.
She was listening but
Now I just try to pretend
It doesn't torture me.
But I forgot the recipe.
You'd have done for me
What ever I asked you to.
Now when you look at me
Now I just try to pretend
It doesn't torture me.
But I forgot the recipe.
And seven odd days later
In the First Battle of Bull Run.
And the letter read...
Heaven is sending you
Do not mourn me dead.
For we shall meet again.
My love for you is deathless.
So if my love of country
Heaven is sending you
Do not mourn me dead.
For we shall meet again.
Heaven is sending you
Heaven is sending you
For certain you will fight
For certain you will meet your death and meet the stars this night.
I'll cloak my face and hide
And I'll battle at your side.
I'll cloak my face and hide
And battle at your side.
No God can save my soul.
It's love and life I fight for
With blade and gun in tow.
I'm feared in every town.
I'll cloak my face and hide.
And battle at your side.
On the good side of town.
Not what you'd think.
Gone in a blink of an eye.
Vanishing in thin air.
Breathing his sweet lullaby.
May as well be smoke.
As an ambulance cries.
There all alone in the dark
Precious fragile little thing
Fly so high and feel no pain
All ye maidens heed my warning
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
They will vow to always love you
Swear no love but yours will do
Then they'll leave you for another
Break your little heart in two
Precious fragile little thing
Fly so high and feel no pain
If I was a little sparrow
O'er these mountains I would fly
Look into his lying eyes
I would flutter all around him
On my little sparrow wings
Why he let me love in vain
I am not a little sparrow
I am just the broken dream
And his evil cunning scheme
Little sparrow... ah... oh
All ye maidens fair and tender
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
You only love me for my big sunglasses
And my Dodge Dart classic
You can't ride in my little red wagon
You can't step to this backyard swagger
But that's just who I be
You can't ride in my little red wagon
You can't step to this backyard swagger
And I do all the shit you wanna do
And my dog does tricks
You can't ride in my little red wagon
May God bless and keep you always
May your wishes all come true
May you always do for others
And let others do for you
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung
And may you stay forever young
May you stay forever young
May you grow up to be righteous
May you grow up to be true
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you
May you always be courageous
Stand upright and be strong
May you stay forever young
May you stay forever young
May your hands always be busy
May your feet always be swift
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift
May your heart always be joyful
May your song always be sung
May you stay forever young
O they tell me of a home far beyond the skies
O they tell me of a home far away
O they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
O they tell me of an unclouded day
O the land of cloudless days
O the land of an unclouded sky
O they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
O they tell me of unclouded day
O they tell me of a home where my friends have gone
O they tell me of that land far away
Where the Tree of Life in eternal bloom
Sheds its fragrance through the unclouded day
O the land of cloudless day
O the land of an unclouded sky
O they tell me of my friends by the Tree of Life
In the land of an unclouded day
O they tell me that He smiles on His children there
And His smile drives their sorrows away
And they tell me that no tears ever come again
In that lovely land of unclouded day
He said it feels good so she gave him her vein
The dope made her numb and numb felt like free
Wide awake for two weeks shooting heroin then speed
Now it's an eye for an eye and you're gonna die
On the cold cement floor she finally cried
Now it's an eye for an eye and you're gonna die
And now the time was here
All the girls were going
But she was gentle as a kittens purr
Still she had to feel the pain
When they called her name
Plan Jane poor Plan Jane
Oh how she wanted to go to the prom
But no one would ask Plan Jane
Poor little girl living in a cold cold world
And lonely she was lonely as could be
But then the phone rang
Tears began to flow like rain
But they were tear of joy the call was from a boy
She was all excited couldn't wait
Going on her very first date
Spent the whole day getting dressed
Had to look her very best
But now its half past eight
Guess her dates gonna be late
Meanwhile at the prom
And the boy who made the call
He was laughing loudest of all
But there joy turned to tears instead
When the morning paper said a girl was dead
To much pain for a girl with a name Plan Jane
Just to much pain for a girl with a name Plan Jane
If my soul could talk to you
I would reminisce every sweet kiss of yesterday
To all you young fools
I've got a lonesome surprise
And light a candle when love dies
That's when you'll find your stairway
To the sky in the ashes of dreams you let die
You may dream you're close to her
If she tore apart your poor heart
Or would you break down
In sentimental refrain
In rhapsody of lasting pain
That's when with every beat of your heart
Will cry for the ashes of dreams you let die
That tomorrow we'll be married
But tomorrow is never there
Many weeks now have I waited
When I'll have you right by my side
But tomorrow ain't never gonna come
Baby is the only name I've called her
Ever since the day she came my way
And told me she was lonely
When I asked her why baby cried
She told me that no boy ever held her hand
Sixteen and she couldn't understand
When I held her hand baby cried
Then she told me that no boy ever held her tight
Only the ones in her dreams at night
And as I held her tenderly
The strangest feeling came over me
And it told me I too was lonely
Who's the one who used to tickle your toes
And who's the one who'd wake in darkest night
To see if you were alright
His baby sleeping tight
Who's the one who worked so hard all day
But when his job was through
He'd come home and play with you
And who's the one who let you put some lipstick on
And wear your hair down long
And who's the one that would wait up late
Waiting on his baby girl to tell him all about her date
And who's the one who saw your tears were real
And said no matter how you feel
A love wound will heal
And who's the one who's cared your whole life through
Now there's someone who has taken you
And who's the one on your wedding day
Who has to smile and say
I do I give my girl away
The rain keeps falling
Tears keep coming down
I wonder she left town
I'd like to see my girl again
She broke my heart in two
And caused me so much pain
My pillow's soaking wet
I can't find her in the morning
My pillow's soaking wet
I can't find her in the morning
The rain keeps falling
Tears keep coming down
I couldn't find my darling
I wonder she left town
My pillow's soaking wet
Where is she in the morning
I swore I'd return with ecstasy
With fortune and fame
And they'd be so proud of me
Tonight they're waiting at the airport
Never been so long alone
My baby still has faith in me
After all she's been through
She's still waiting for me
For since I've gone I haven't heard
Never been so long alone
Oh I've never been so long alone
No I never never been so long alone
Done a lot things I'm sorry
For things I wouldn't do anymore
But my biggest mistake of all
Was leaving my home town
Since then my foolish thoughts have died
Grass isn't really greener on the other side
They won't forget you're there
There's a cloud of love
And it's hovering over my hometown
Pretty girls see a lonely you
Going to my home town
And there's a sign saying ten more miles to my hometown
Looking through the misty dawn
I see the city lights and they're waving me on
Well you had nothing when I met you baby
But look what you got now
Sometimes I wonder did I make a mistake
But I brought you from the south
So I'm gonna take you back to Georgia
Well back where you belong
You done got in the big city baby
You done started doing me wrong
Well your Momma and your Daddy told me baby
Not to take you from the south
I took you to the city when you were a child
And the fight bout knocked you out
And girl I'm gonna take you back to Georgia
Oh because you don't know a thing
Well when I first met you baby
You couldn't read or write your name
Well you run the streets with your wig hair
Trying to play your high class games
You run the streets both day and night
You don't have pocket change
So I'm gonna take you back to Georgia
Well before I have to lose my mind
Well I just can't understand it baby
What is that makes your head so hot
I'm gonna take you back to Georgia
Right back where you belong
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a night so long
The moon just went behind a cloud
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a robin weep
That means he's lost the will to live
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
It's not unusual to be loved by anyone
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
But when I see you hanging about with anyone
It's not unusual to see me cry
It's not unusual to go out at any time
But when I see you out and about it's such a crime
If you should ever want to be loved by anyone
No matter what you say
You'll find it happens all the time
Why can't this crazy love be mine
It's not unusual to be mad with anyone
It's not unusual to be sad with anyone
But if I ever find that you've changed at anytime
It's not unusual to find that I'm in love with you
Children were laughing then
I could hear a bluebird sing
And the warmth of your arms
Oh the warmth of your arms
And we were walking by the shore
You said you'd marry me
Now I cry but can't you see
These teardrops in my eyes
They're for all we planned
Our whole lives through
Things we'll never do
Things we'll never do
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down.
I'm gonna wait for the midnight hour
When there's no one else around.
And do all the things I told you
In the midnight hour.
I'm gonna wait till stars come out
And see that twinkle in your eyes.
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love begins to shine.
You'll be the only girl I love
And really love you so
In the midnight hour.
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down.
I'm gonna wait for the midnight hour
When there's no one else around.
And do all the things I told you
In the midnight hour.
I'm gonna wait till stars come out
And see that twinkle in your eyes.
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love begins to shine.
You'll be the only girl I love
And really love you so
In the midnight hour.
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
I'll pretend I'm free from sorrow
Make believe that wrong is right
Your wedding day will be tomorrow
But there'll be no teardrops tonight
Are you doing this for spite
If you only want to hurt me
Then there'll be no teardrops tonight
I believe that you still love me
But you think that you're above me
But there'll be no teardrops tonight
Other arms will hold you tight
You don't care whose life you're ruining
Who's the one who tied you shoe when you were young
And knew just when to come and see what you had done
When you told her your first love was over
She'd met someone older mama mama
Results graduation mama mama
When you introduced you future bride
As you walked down the isle through tears you saw her
I told her I'd never leave her in a million days
I told her I'd never leave her in a million days
You found someone new
Since she went away I don't know what I'll do
Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Still in love with you
Today I passed you on the street
Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
And he looked so satisfied
And you know he looked so satisfied
It hurts to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss
How much that I miss yeah
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
If you're lucky enough
To have someone who loves you
Then be glad that you got
Someone who loves you
Cold lips that were warm
Listen to the wisdom of a fool
When you take her poor heart
And you do something to it
And you think to yourself
You may find that the
Listen to the wisdom of a fool
But you still have time to say
I awakened this morning
I was filled with despair
All my dreams turned to ashes and cold
And as I looked at my life
It was barren and bare
Without love I have nothing at all
I have nothing at all
I could conquer the world
But nothing would I have
Without love I have nothing at all
Oh I could conquer the world
But what would I have
I have nothing at all
A star fell from Heaven
A brighter star I know
Then I found out that it was only you
Who came into my life
The twinkle in your eye
Oh you must have strayed
The twinkle in your eye
Oh you must have strayed
If you love me half as much as I love you
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
You only build me up to let me down
If you needed me half as much as I need you
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
I know that I would never never never be blue
Though my heart ached with a love for you
The chance that you might love me too
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
Honey if you love love me half as much as I love you
Down amongst the swamps
Who gets lost in Miller's Cave
You know I had me a girl
But she had unfaithful ways
Just like I wasn't wanted
Like the bats and the bears in Miller's cave
Everybody calls him baby
I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave
Boy y'all gonna pay for this
And they laughed at me
On down to Miller's Cave
Well I guess I showed
In the state of Georgia
They'll never find me
I'll be in New York City
When the lights shine bright tonight
Where my woman waits for me
Arms that hold me tenderly
Lips as sweet as honeycomb
Love that waits for me alone
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
The eyes of a New York woman
Are eyes that can hold a man
She swept me off of my feet
Made my world seem so complete
I'll never have to look for more
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
Thought I wasn't ready
For the tie that binds
But I lost my heart to her
When her eyes met mine
Now I see her differently
I've got to make her mine
So I'll make my home Fun City
And let the lights shine bright on me
I'll never have to look for more
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
The eyes of a New York woman
Are eyes that can hold a man
She swept me off of my feet
Made my world seem so complete
I'll never have to look for more
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
Been sleeping in your head
Those old dark clouds
Been hanging around your head
But all your hard times
Will vanish in the wind
When the mighty clouds of joy
Let your love seize us
When the mighty clouds of joy
Those old storm clouds
Are slowly drifting by
And those old raindrops
Are fading from your eyes
Gonna shine on us again
When the mighty clouds of joy
Let your love seize us
When the mighty clouds of joy
Won't you let your love seize us
Let us find sweet peace within
When the mighty clouds of joy
A lonely soul within me cries
For the lifetime I've wasted
The love that I've tasted
When you hold me in your arms so tight
That you're in love with me
Lips are sweet as candy
The taste stays on my mind
For another cup of wine
But I don't need a cure
I'll just stay addicted
And hope I can endure
All the good love when we're all alone
That you're in love with me
All the good love when we're all alone
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
Something here inside
They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt all love
Yet today my love has flown away
Now laughing friends deride
When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes
Smoke gets in your eyes
Out where the bright lights are glowing
You're drawn like a moth to a flame
You laugh while the wines overflowing
While I sit and whisper your name
Four walls too near me
One night with you is like heaven
And while I'm walking the floor
I listen for steps in the hallway
And wait for your knock on my door
Four walls too near me
Four walls too near me
Just these four lonely walls
And one lonely room is where I stand
And wait for a knock on my door
And needed no one else
Depending only on myself
Crumbling in your hand
You turned me into sand
But stone in love with you
I was a rolling stone
Crumbling in your hand
You turned me into sand
But stone in love with you
Crumbling in your hand
You turned me into sand
But stone in love with you
I've been down this road before
I've felt like this somewhere before
I've felt the warm hand
Yes I've been down that road before
I've walked along this road somewhere
I learned a lot then and there
I know a smile can turn into a frown
I've been down that road before
I missed a lot of chances
And I've seen a green light
To read the detour sign
It's a heavy toll to pay
Empty feelings left to bare
I reached for you but you weren't there
With darkness at my door
Yes I've been down that road before
Yes I've been down that road before
I saw pity in the face of a friend
And that's something I don't wanna see again
With sad eyes he gave me sympathy
Oh I saw pity in the face of a friend
Even though he tried to hide it with a grin
Yes he put on a very good act
So I'm taking that road away from you
Gonna find myself a place to hide
And when people remember they say
He was saving face and pride
I saw pity in the face of my friend
But for some reason I had to look again
And there in his eyes
The truth was plain to see
That you really loved and not me
Oh I saw saw pity in the eyes of my friend
And it told me that you loved only him
And it's tearing me all up inside
Because I like what you're doing
And it's something I've never tried
You're tempting me to come on strong
And when I look in your eyes girl
There's no way to tell right from wrong
So pass the apple and give me a bite
My resistance is low and I just can't fight it
I don't think I can ask you to leave
So pass the apple Eve
You make me reach out for more girl
I'm really coming alive
But you better think what you're doing
Before you get us both satisfied
So pass the apple and give me a bite
My resistance is low and I just can't fight it
Now I know I can't ask you to leave
So pass the apple Eve
I can't leave you alone
Give me a bite I just can't fight it
Pass the apple and give me a bite
My resistance is low and I just can't fight it
Now I know I don't want you to leave
So pass the apple Eve
I'm gonna do all the things for you
A girl wants a man to do
I'll sacrifice for you
I'll even do wrong too
You with love and affection
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
My love is strong you see
I know you'll never get tired of me
To try my best to get you hooked
Every night every day
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me yeah
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I see the sunlight in her hair
I feel the warm smile that she wears
She has no recipe for love
And I just can't get enough
From the distance of my mind
To wake up to my destiny
It's time to face reality
It's only love that I feel inside
But I'll get by somehow
I tell myself that it's not real
There's nothing left for me to feel
I'll just be going on my way
Tomorrow brings another day
It's only love that I feel inside
But I've got to be strong
It's only love but I know I'll get by
I'll take my heart and pride and just throw them aside
Ever had a love as sweet as my love
For nowhere in the world
Could there be a boy as true as you love
You give gladly to me
Oh why should it be that
We go on hurting each other
We go on hurting each other
Making each other cry
Without ever knowing why
Close than the leaves
I could love only you
You could love only me
Oh why should it be that
We go on hurting each other
We go on hurting each other
Making each other cry
Without ever knowing why
Can't we stop hurting each other
Gotta stop hurting each other
Making each other cry
Breaking each other's heart
If you would come into my life again
I would never hurt you like I did you then
So satisfied to live again
I know my face would wear smile again
And when I feel your touch I'd hear my heart begin
To start beating inside
I can't count the ways that I missed you
How much I've wanted to kiss you
Girl you know that you're still in my soul
You're the only hope left in this world I have
So won't you say that you love me
One look at you is all I need
To bring breath back to me
So won't you take me by the hand
Let's make love destiny
That's what I thought
I don't know that I will
But until I can find me
And won't play games behind me
I know it's been done
I don't know that I will
But until I can find me
And won't play games behind me
I don't know that I will
But until I can find me
And won't play games behind me
For you and your new love
To have dinner on the ground
For you and your new love
To share the new love that you've found
On you and your new love
I'll be seeing you again
She woke us all up with a terrible scream.
And hate your neighbor for the shade of his skin.
And mommy and daddy are who's to blame.
And I wake up in the morning
With my hair down in my eyes and she says hi
And I stumble to the breakfast table
And she reaches out and takes my hand and squeezes it
And see my morning sun.
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summer time.
And there's no such thing as Dr. Seuss
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summer time.
I think about her face and go and ease my mind.
Meet me and maybe we can grab a bite to eat.
And she drops what she's doing
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes.
Raindrops are falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
So I just did me some talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
He's sleeping on the job
But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Just smile when I fall
The world will still be turning
Without you life goes on
And spring will be returning
Each year though you're gone
I won't show the tear
I'll hide all my fears
And even though I try
And still pretend that I
Don't need your warmth
Don't need your touch
That I know I can't keep you for good
And I'm not even sure that I should
If you must leave my life
You'll leave me alone
Before you leave my life
Be sure to have your own
Somewhere in my mouth
Forever is so very long
I don't want your life to go wrong
If you must leave my life
Before you leave my life
Be sure you have your heart
Now consider every part
Girl be sure to have your heart
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Be sure you have your heart
Kinda hard to love a guy like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better that your own kin did
From the very start it's my own fault
What happens to my heart
You see I've always known you'd go
So you just do what you gotta do
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss
Those sweet lips again
Find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can
Now I know it'll make you feel sad
And make you feel so bad
They say you don't treat me me like you should
They got ways to make you feels no good
I guess they got no way to know
I've had my eyes wide open from the start
The part of you that they'll never see
Is the part you've shown to me
So you just do what you gotta do
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss
Those sweet lips again
Find that dappled dream of yours
Have you any mail today
I've been waiting for a letter
I've tried to reach her every way
She's way down in New Orleans
And Boston's so far away
Funny how we met in Georgia
It had to be my lucky day
Well I had her name and number
Written down in my little red book
But when my plane flew in back home
It wasn't there when I took a look
I know I searched for it everywhere
I wonder what shape my mind was in
But all I know I got to see her again
Won't you help me sleep tonight
Won't you bring me just one letter
And everything will be alright
And everything will be alright
People stop and stare
I can't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes
I won't let you leave my love behind
No I won't let you leave
Where have the people gone
Look through the window
Seems like I'm the only one around.
All of the streets are bare
Don't have to wait for a seat at the movie
Plenty of classrooms everyplace
And it looks like we're ready
To give it one more try
This time there'll be no alibi
I just can't help believing
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty morning
And the promise of tomorrow in her eyes
And I just can't help believing
When she's lying close beside me
And my heart beats with the rhythm of her sigh
This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
I just can't help believing
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
That my fingers fold around it like a glove
And I just can't help believing
When she's whispering her magic
And her tears are shining honey sweet with love
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
For more than just a day
Write them and say I'm the kid they used to laugh at
Send my picture along with the news
Of all the good things I've done
Nothing good ever would become of me
Let them know just how wrong they all can be
Paste my picture all over the walls
In all the halls of the school I used to go to
I was mixed up and kind of confused
No one around to took the time to find out
What was wrong and to try to understand
Maybe now they'll give kids a helping hand
That's how it really ought to be
Not like the way it was with me
Maybe now they'll give kids a helping hand
I hope to God they cast aside
So I went out and really tried
To make you laugh I'll play the fool for you
Although the people turn and stare
It breaks my heart when you not there
I'll stage a ballet on a tabletop
Command performance finger sized
And though I have no tune my show won't flop
I'll find the music in your eyes
Let your love light shine on me
We'll blow a genie from a cigarette
We'll take a magic carpet ride
You must keep us side by side
Let your love light shine on me
Let your love light shine on me
And needed no one else
Depending only on myself
Crumbling in your hand
You turned me into sand
But stone in love with you
I was a rolling stone
Crumbling in your hand
You turned me into sand
But stone in love with you
Crumbling in your hand
You turned me into sand
But stone in love with you
I'm at the railroad station in st. Paul
But girl I'd love to see you most of all
Ever since the train left Montreal
Thought I'd always love this life I'm living
But now I know I love you most of all
Many times before I know I swore that I'd come home to stay...
But it always seems that foolish dream and trains got in my way
Tomorrow there will be snow in Minnesota
But I won't be around to watch it fall
I'll be heading for that old familiar station...
I miss ya baby... Most of all
It looks like another fall.
Your friends they don't seem to help at all.
Just look up your rainy day man.
You've made a hole much too big to mend.
So go on home and look up your rainy day man.
You can't hide the truth with a happy song.
Just go call up your rainy day man.
Lord none can save you.
It looks like another fall.
Your good friends they don't seem to help at all.
And she's bound to love me some
And she's bound to love me some
Like a circle around the sun
Just to try to take my rest
I was trying to take my rest
But my thoughts they just kept wandering
Like the wild geese in the west
It's gonna shine in my back yard someday
It's gonna shine in my back yard someday
And that wind just bound to rise up
And she's bound to love me some
And she's bound to love me some
Read in the paper nearly day
A happy little home comes up for sale
Because two fools have tried and failed to get along
And ya know that's wrong
A man hurts a woman and a woman hurts a man
And take it with a grain of salt
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all
No love at all is a poor old man
No love at all is a child in the street
And that's a long row to hoe
No love at all is a troubled young girl
And it's a pretty short fall
Now people believe me
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all
Oh you got to believe me
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
Rainy night in Georgia
Such a rainy night in Georgia
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night
Rainy night in Georgia
How many times I wondered
But it still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it or you think of it
I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
A rainy night in Georgia
Such a rainy night in Georgia
You look at me and baby all you see
Baby all that I am is what I symbolize
Have twisted your mind and you turn away
You won't trust what I say and it's tearing me apart
I'm holding out my hand to you
Tell me please what else can I do
Then you came and warmed my soul
I need you everyday to stop my loneliness
Everything that's good for me
This wonderful feeling
When I touch your hand
What a happy thing can be
This wonderful feeling
When I touch your hand
What a happy thing can be
She was just sixteen and all alone
So we grew up together
Now things were bad and she was scared
But whenever I would cry
She'd calm my fears and dry my tears
With a rock and roll lullaby
Sing it sweet and clear
We made it through the lonely days
When mama sang a song
Now I can't recall the words at all
It don't make sense to try
In that rock and roll lullaby
Nothing moves my soul
Like the sound of a good old rock and roll lullaby
Nothing moves my soul
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
All my life I was alone
Didn't think I'd find my part
Now I see there's joy inside your arms
Every day I searched for the star
That never was in the sky
And now I see this star is on earth
And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that I would be
If I gave you a chance to come inside my life
And I am happier than the morning sun
And that's the way it will always be
That's the way it will always be
Ever since the day you came inside of my life
And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
Bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
Happier than the morning sun
That's the way you said it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the stars above
That's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside of my life
I believe that everyone should be
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
These boots ain't traveled through
And I'm losing all my heart
But the point of no returning
Something feels mighty wrong
First you came to own my body
Now you're out to get my soul
And I can't tell which is you
And I only have the hope of feeling free
Everybody's calling out directions
Now I never had a mind
That took too kindly to direction
But lately I don't know
Are you anywhere bound
Does a man have to admit he's lost
Before he can be found
When the miles keep rolling by
And he's scared and he don't know why
Does he come right out and shout
Or does he let his roads
When I wake up in the morning feeling like
And the day comes crashing down around about the time my feet hit the floor
There ain't nothing I know
Laced with sweet cherry wine
And I recall that I ain't got a one
And I fell so doggone bored
Lord that dying sounds like it could be fun
There ain't nothing I know
Laced with sweet cherry wine
When I'm going to pot
Just give me a shot of sweet cherry wine
I just can't do without it
There ain't no doubt about it
That nothing can warm up
With sweet cherry wine
This cold heart of mine
I said sweet cherry wine
We thought our little flight would never end
I knew you were my friend
Were chasing after wooden airplanes
And yes I guess I've done some bad
I think I've gone completely mad
If the story of my life
That was the finest time
That was the finest time
He makes love to her every night
And you know this ain't no lie
She makes love in the afternoon
He comes in saying where ya been
She just look him in the eye
She says you can get everything you need
It's a fine way to go
For just a little while
It's a fine way to go
If anyone asks ya how you know
You just tell them I told you so
Well Sidewalk Joe he lives alone
And he waits till the sun goes down
So he can slip out on the streets
Well he sits on the side
Hoping that when the lights go down
Ya know Old Joe really gets off at the movie
It's a fine way to go
For just a little while
It's a fine way to go
If anyone asks ya how you know
You just tell them I told you so oh
It's a fine way to go
For just a little while
It's a fine way to go
If anyone asks ya how you know
Tears don't fit your face
They don't fit your act somehow
Till you find someone who's glad to tag along
And you'll be just as happy
And I'll be just as gone
Go and wash your streaming eyes
Pull yourself back together
Tighten it up and realize
It was never your style to beg a man to stay
So don't tell me that we'll never get along
And I'll be just as gone
Just as gone as the summer when it's snowing
Just as gone as the wind when it ain't blowing
That you're only hanging on
I'm just as good as gone
So stop your carrying on
Stop your carrying on
If I saw a woman that looked a lot like you
And if I thought this woman
Oh but there's not another you
If she had eyes like you do and she knew how to smile
And if I thought the feeling
Oh but there's not another you
I'm staring loneliness face to face
There's no one around
No one around that can take your place
If I thought this woman could make me feel that fine
I'd wrap me up in her love
Oh but there's not another you
Oh but there's not another you
Your eyes are distant
I wonder where you are tonight
Haven't heard a word I said
What's inside your head
I never thought you were dreaming
Or is it there's so much between us
Have we changed so much
That we can't find our way
Let's stop pretending
And lay it on the line
There's no telling what we'll find
When we closed our eyes
Or maybe tomorrow seems so far today
Have we changed so much
That we can't find our way
Are we too far off this base
And find the pieces that are scattered on the ground
Where are we headed for
What's happening to you and I
Sometimes I wake up and the dark of night is creeping
And the early morning hush is all around
I wonder if any of my dreams are worth keeping
Or are they as foolish as they sound
There's so little time
And so many treasures to be found
Maybe someday I'll find myself a warm bed to sleep in
Then the early morning hush won't get me down
There's so little time
And so many treasures to be found
Maybe someday I'll find myself a warm bed to sleep in
Then the early morning hush won't get me down
Maybe someday I'll find myself a warm bed to sleep in
Then the early morning hush won't get me down
It slips away before ya know it's gone
Ya build up walls and before ya know it
Someone moves you and you want to show it
I've been alone too long
Baby now don't you see
I've been alone too long
That's all that's wrong with me
I want to build you a dream
Write you a beautiful song
I've been alone too long
And tell yourself your wounds are healing
When all you've done is turn the pain inside
And when your sure no one can get to ya
Someone smiles and it goes right through ya
I've been alone too long
Baby now don't you see
I've been alone too long
That's all that's wrong with me
I want to build you a dream
Write you a beautiful song
I've been alone too long
I've been alone too long
I've been alone too long
I've been alone too long
It's such a beautiful day
That the sky seems to say good morning
Mister dust off your shoes
Throw away all your blues
Take a good look around
There's no clouds looking down
Sunday sunrise shining through my window pane
Chasing away my cares with all the pouring rain
Sunday sunrise unfolding like a smile
Making me feel just like a new born baby child
Well I'm feeling so good
I keep knocking on wood
I hear birds everywhere
Singing songs in the air with a meaning
Get a whole new outlook
And come on out where it's warm
Sunday sunrise shining through my window pane
Chasing away my cares with all the pouring rain
Sunday sunrise unfolding like a smile
Making me feel just like a new born baby child
Sunday sunrise shining through my window pane
Chasing away my cares with all the pouring rain
Sunday sunrise unfolding like a smile
Now your Father has told you
For something to believe
The realities of power
Are above your ideals
And he sure has good reasons
For the way that he feels
For man has never hesitated
And take more than he needs
Can there be any doubt
To the size of his crimes
After all that we've seen
Oh but what kind of logic
In what kind of brain
Would think it was sane
And what heart that beats
Would chose to kill millions
For an honorable peace
There are those who will argue
You must live past the present
As if the peasant in the fields
Hearing planes in the sky
Waits for history to tell him
Now I'm sorry that you have to hear
They're not pleasant to sing
They're not pleasant to write
I know the tide of protest
Has passed us somehow
Oh but when do you speak out
If you don't speak out now
In what kind of brain
Would think it was sane
And what heart that beats
Would chose to kill millions
For an honorable peace
In what kind of brain
Would think it was sane
In what heart that beats
Would chose to kill millions
For an honorable peace
In what kind of brain
Would think it was sane
In what heart that beats
Would chose to kill millions
And I'm too tired to go for your show
And she started to explain
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues
Just make me lay back and grin like a monkey
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues
Just make me lay back and grin like a monkey
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues
It's enough to make it light in the dark
It's enough to make a bite just a bark
It's enough to make a body move around
It's enough to make a rabbit hug a hog
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues
Just make me lay back and grin like a monkey
Play something I can understand
City on a Sunday morning
Everybody's gone away
Seems to me I like it best that way
Standing on an empty corner
Caught up in a very funny mood today
Footsteps on the sidewalk
6 AM the sun is peeking through
Lazy alley cat is sleeping
Whiling the time away
There's something about a city
That's why I love Sunday
The streets are all rolled up empty
I'm strolling down old Broadway
Sure looks like a peaceful town today
A hobo tips his hat good morning
And I tossed him a dime
On a city morning feeling fine
That's why I love Sunday
City on a Sunday morning
Everybody's gone away
Seems to me I like it best that way
Standing on an empty corner
Caught up in a very funny mood today
There's something about a city
There's something about a city
But I can't get through
You used to be my friend
And I don't really know how it happened
And I don't really know what to say
I just wonder how we ever got this way
That's what it's all about
Why can't we talk it out
And say what's on our minds
So much we need to say
And I don't really know how it happened
But I don't understand
How we ever let it get so out of hand
Things that we've done and said
And I don't really know how it happened
And I don't really know what to say
But I can't bring myself
Wish I was the Superman
I'd write all the news today
And my feet they wanna dance
But I ain't got a chance
If I'm gonna have to wait forever
Well it might as well be never
I said I don't have a chance
And every door leads right back to the fog
And my feet they wanna dance
But I ain't got a chance
If I'm gonna have to wait forever
Well it might as well be never
I said I don't have a chance
Am I gonna have to wait forever
Well it might as well be never
Met the girl that I want to get to know a little better
Tonight I'm gonna take her to the picture show
Gonna park in the darkest spot I know
That I never asked anybody else before
Love me all of my life
Don't wanna grow old without ya
Don't wanna be out in the cold without ya
Been saving my good times for the good
Would you hold me and never ever let me go
I've been told about love for so long
Been left cold without love for so long
Told of disappointments all so wrong
Without you beside me
Love me all of my life
Don't wanna grow old without ya
Don't wanna be out in the cold without ya
Been saving my good times for the good
Would you hold me and never ever let me go
Been saving my good times for the good
Would you hold me and never ever let me go
Love me all of my life
Don't wanna grow old without ya
Don't wanna be out in the cold without ya
Been saving my good times for the good
Would you hold me and never ever let me go
Been saving my good times for the good
Sitting at the stage door of the Palace
Looking down the alley two ways
One way takes my mind back home to Alice
The other to my ballyhoo days
There was a time my name had swept the nation
I wonder how much living I have wasted
Clinging to my ballyhoo days
God almighty when I go
Please let me go dancing ...
I've seen life from both sides of the curtain
And the only life for me is the stage
But nowadays my work is more uncertain
And filled with dreams of ballyhoo days
God almighty when I go
Please let me go dancing ...
I don't want to read the paper this morning
I don't want to hear no busy city sounds
There's so many things that's so much more important
Why don't go somewhere and love
It's been a long long time
Why don't we just go somewhere and love
And lock the world outside
We don't need a reason or a rhyme
Don't take the time to stop and think about it
If we talk too much we might just change our mind
So why don't we go somewhere and love
And leave it all behind
Why don't we just go somewhere and love
And stay a long long time
Why don't we go somewhere and love
And leave it all behind
Why don't we just go somewhere and love
The morning sun woke me
I felt the warmth of soft skin beneath my hand
Last night the devil got to me
And today I'm just a common man
So I'll get up and say goodbye
On my way home I'll make up the lie
That holds our lives together one more time
This is the last time
There's not a soul I know around
They said this town's a waste of time
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
I got my pills to ease the pain
Can't find a thing to ease the rain
I'd love to try and settle down
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Yeah they say the blues
I wouldn't know I haven't been there yet
Got the sunshine above me
The rent note is spent
And I don't know if I'll find a way
And we're happy together
Now I don't know much about tomorrow
I only know that I love you today
And we're happy together
And we're happy together
Now it take much to make me happy
Most times a smile from you will do
As long as I know you'll keep on loving me
I know that I'll get by
That'll see me through
If this is how it feels to be satisfied
And we're happy together
And we're happy together
And we're happy together
It's lonely out tonight
And the feeling just got right for a brand new love song
Somebody done somebody wrong song
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
So sad that it makes everybody cry
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
So sad that it makes everybody cry
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
I could smile for a while
And then I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say hello
As you wished me well
You couldn't tell that
But it's true oh so true
I love you even more than I did before
For you don't love me
And from this moment on
City boys singing country songs
And they tell you what they've seen
City boys singing country songs
But they don't know what they mean
How can a boy from Philly tell ya
How it feels it feels to be in the arms
And how can a New Yorker born and raised
Taste the taste of the popcorn
City boys wearing western blue jeans
Walking down the streets
Just a shining on their feet
What good will blue jeans do ya
If you ain't gonna roll around
In the Mississippi mud awhile
And how will the boots come in that handy
If the dandy don't wanna walk across an Iowa cornfield
City boys singing country songs
And they tell you what they've seen
City boys singing country songs
But they don't know what they mean
Now how can a boy from Philly tell ya
How it feels it feels to be in the arms
And how can a New Yorker born and raised
Taste the taste of the popcorn
I flash back and think about
The time I first found you
You took me in just as I was
And made me feel brand new
And though it wasn't long ago
At times it's hard to believe
It really actually happened
I remember oh so clear
When you came here in my heart
I remember that old me
And doubt if I can keep it up
Till I go back and see
The first time that you found me
You must have known love well
Or maybe you were love itself
At the time I couldn't tell
Now I finally found out
I remember oh so clear
When you came here in my heart
I remember oh so clear
Now I finally found out
I remember oh so clear
You were there to catch me
You were there to catch me
The paper moon I was reaching for
Was never really there
And you were there to catch me
When I fell into your love
When you came my sadness
Your love gave me something
My life was broken and shattered
But you made the pieces fall right in place
And you were there to catch me
When I fell into your love
Your arms were open wide
You never turned your back on me
And never said goodbye
And you were there to catch me
But now you're right beside me
When I need your love
Life a leaf I was surely falling
And you were the ground
You were there to catch me
When I fell into your love
You were there to catch me
When I fell into your love
You were there to catch me
When I fell into your love
You were there to catch me
When I fell into your love
You were there to catch me
When I fell into your love
You were there to catch me
I've had peace and I've had joy
Every since I found you
And everyday is full of hope
Now that I'm around you
You bring to me storybook reality
Storybook realities are what you to me
You took my rusty dreams and made them new
Storybook realities are what I live each day
You're a way of life to me
You know all my problems
You bring to me storybook reality
Storybook realities are what you to me
You took my rusty dreams and made them new
Storybook realities are what I live each day
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
I've lived down in a valley
You live on that mountain above
And although we live in different places
The common ground we share is love
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
If we met as total strangers
And if we came from different lands
And if we didn't speak the same language
Love's one thing we both would understand
Because love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
Love is our common ground
They say that heavens pretty
And living here is too
But if they said that I would
Have to choose between the two
And sometimes when I'm dreaming
It comes as no surprise
That if you look and see
The homesick feeling in my eyes
While I'm here I'll serve him gladly
And sing him all my songs
And when I'm feeling lonely
And when I'm feeling blue
It's such a joy to know that
I am only passing through
And one day I'll be sleeping
When death knocks on my door
And I'll awake and find
That I'm not homesick anymore
I don't know how long I'll be here
And where He leads I will go with Him
When I hear Him call my name
When it will take place
But it does not matter
If I'm walking in His grace
I feel it won't be long now
Until He comes for me
He's gonna take me with Him
And at His feet I'll bow
We are open please come in
Fill us up with love again
We want to praise you
You have made us what we are
By your blood and by your scars
We want to praise you
Words are so empty and time is so short
To show you how much we love you
On the cross you took our place
Thought we don't deserve your grace
You created everything
Help us worship when we sing
We want to praise you
On the cross you took our place
Thought we don't deserve your grace
On the cross you took our place
Somethings bound to go wrong
But she looks in my eyes
Everything will turn out alright
Each morning I awake and fine
The sunlight softly shining in her hair
And then I realize that I'm only
There's magic in her eyes
That makes me come alive
Everything will turn out alright
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you
Baby nothing could go wrong with you
Oh what she does to me
When she makes love to me
Everything will turn out alright
It's funny how love goes
But honey my loves grows
Even though there's no reason to doubt
You keep saying it's wrong
Neither one of us is free
Still I wanna hold on
When even a fool would let go
Even a child would say no
When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now is it wise holding you
When even a fool would let go
My love had no reason
Like the words to a song that don't rhyme
I just know that it's there all the time
I can believe that's wrong
Makes me want to hold on
When even a fool would let go
Even a child would say no
When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now is it wise holding you
When even a fool would let go
Tell me now is it wise holding you
Met you on a springtime day
Lady when you looked my way
I had a strange sensation
That it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Oh I wake up in the night
But instead I find someone
Who believed in me when I said I'd always care
Oh it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
So I lived my life in a dream world
For the rest of my days
Oh I guess that's all that it would ever be
Wish I had a time machine I could
Make myself go back until the day I was born
And I would live my life again
And rearrange it so that I'd be yours from now on
Oh it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Oh it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
He's the hand on my shoulder
When I need to know someone cares
He's the hand on my shoulder
Assuring me that He's always there
He's the voice in the silence
That sounds so sweet and so clear
He's the voice in the silence
Telling me that He's always near
So there's no need for me to worry
When things aren't going quite so smooth
He will always see me through
He's the light in the darkness
Shining through bright as day
He's the light in the darkness
Guiding me each step of the way
He's the hand on my shoulder
When I need to know someone cares
He's the hand on my shoulder
There's a gap in the world
And we can bridge that gap
We'll need help from above
But if everybody pitches in
We can build a bridge of love
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
From nation to nation
Standing through each generation
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
That's what it's gonna take
Then one day we'll cross that
Bridge to a better life
And we'll leave behind us
That old world of strife
When we reach our new world
Hate we'll never fear
And I bet if we could see God's face
He'd be smiling from ear to ear
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
From nation to nation
Standing through each generation
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
That's what it's gonna take
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
From nation to nation
Standing through each generation
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
That's what it's gonna take
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
From nation to nation
Standing through each generation
Would wash men's feet
Then turn the other cheek
I want to be more like Him
He was more concerned
I want to be more like Him
I want to be more like Jesus
That's why I've put my life in His hands
I want to be more like Jesus
And with His help I know that I can
Who had him crucified
I want to be more like Him
Everyday in every way
I want to be more like Jesus
That's why I've put my life in His hands
I want to be more like Jesus
And with His help I know that I can
I want to be more like Jesus
That's why I've put my life in His hands
I was lost as could be
I was caught in a world
Spinning around in misery
You took me in and you touched my heart
With your song of love
You gave me a brand new start
Now there's beautiful music
Flowing all through me
Joy bells ringing inside my head
Since you came inside me
Now I'm lost inside your love
To make me hunger for more of you
And I don't wanna break loose
With my heart in my hand
I'll do what you say to
Just never let me go Lord
I'm so in love with you
Now there's beautiful music
Flowing all through me
Joy bells ringing inside my head
Since you came inside me
Now I'm lost inside your love
Now there's beautiful music
Flowing all through me
Joy bells ringing inside my head
Now there's beautiful music
Flowing all through me
When I die there won't be much
To salvage from my earnings
I never had a lot of land or houses to my name
I've never been a corporate prince
On Madison and New York
I never held a diamond in my hand
But I've seen children laughing
And I've known my Creator
And I've been a happy man
I never really loved the way I saw it in the movies
But I had myself a woman of my own
The place we lived was modest
And we kept the yard together
I never traveled far from my hometown
But I've heard music playing
That made me understand
And touched the hearts of heaven
And I've been a happy man
Life has had it's hard times
When I've felt the chill of winter
I can't forget the night
When my sweet Julie slipped away
But growing old is different
Than I always thought it would be
The sweetness of my youth
Beneath His guiding hand
And knowing soon I'll see Him
Has made me a happy man
And knowing soon I'll see Him
What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh what a difference you've made in my life
What a change you have made in my heart
What a change you have made in my heart
You've replaced all the broken parts
Oh what a change you have made in my heart
Love to me was just a word in a song
And then way over you
But now I join in the singing
That's why I want to spread the news
What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh what a difference you've made
What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh what a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh what a difference you've made
What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
He's got it all in control
He's got it all in control
He's put that reassurance
He's got it all in control
I've put my life in His hands
I've put my life in His hands
So every road I walk down
I'm sure is in His plan
He holds the stars in the sky
He holds the land back from the sea
If He can do all of that
Surely he can take care
He's got it all in control
He's got it all in control
He's put that reassurance
He's got it all in control
He's got it all in control
God's got it all in control
He's put that reassurance
He's got it all in control
He's got it all in control
God's got it all in control
He's got it all in control
God's got it all in control
For the flowers that grow
There would be nothing I know
For the sun in the sky
I'm so grateful that I
For the rivers that flow
There would be nothing I know
And the songs that we sing
And the joy that You bring
I have nothing to fear
As long as I have You here
For the birds in the trees
I am down on my knees
For the rain and the snow
There would nothing I know
For all the mountains
That You give us to climb
Yeah I say one more time
I have nothing to fear
As long as I have You here
As long as I have You here
Lost and feeling lonely
I was always glad to see a day go by
The darkness just got deeper
The mountains just got steeper
But when I heard the Word it changed my life
It gently touched my heart and changed my life
And I could never thank You enough
Loved and feeling worth it
I want to share this happiness I've found
You're the song I'm singing
You give my life meaning
That's why I want to spread the Word around
It gently touched my heart and changed my life
And I could never thank You enough
It gently touched my heart and changed my life
I heard about it raining on a Georgia night
Never saw clearly in the morning light
She was a rainy day woman
Took my soul and I soon discovered
Everybody loves a rain song
Cause everybody's been rained on
It's like a shoulder you can lean on
Everybody loves a rainbow
From San Francisco to Chicago
And no matter where I go
It's still raining in my heart
When your memories get too cloudy to see
She was a rainy day woman
Took my soul and I soon discovered
Everybody loves a rain song
Cause everybody's been rained on
It's like a shoulder you can lean on
Everybody loves a rainbow
From San Francisco to Chicago
And no matter where I go
It's still raining in my heart
Everybody loves a rain song
Cause everybody's been rained on
It's like a shoulder you can lean on
Everybody loves a rainbow
From San Francisco to Chicago
And no matter where I go
An out of town gawkier
I threw in my quarter
Watched it shining in the water
And wished for a southern belle
It must have hypnotized me
Long dress with lace pockets
Around her neck a golden locket
There stood my southern belle
Lay back we're riding on the Blues River
On board the Delta Queen
Paddle wheel steamers
And beautiful dreamers
All the way to New Orleans
And all along the delta night
There's pyramids of cotton
As far as the eye can see
Right now we're strangers
But there's no danger
Lay back we're riding on the Blues River
On board the Delta Queen
Paddle wheel steamers
And beautiful dreamers
All the way to New Orleans
Lay back we're riding on the Blues River
Her majesty the queen
Right now we're strangers
But there's no danger
Lay back we're riding on the Blues River
On board the Delta Queen
Paddle wheel steamers
Using things and loving people
That's the way it's got to be
Using things and loving people
Look around and you can see
That loving things and using people
Using things and loving people
That's the way it's got to be
Being loved is in the giving
All we have is what we share
Loving life is for the living
You have to have a heart to care
And loving things and using people
Using things and loving people
That's the way it's got to be
So put your hand inside my hand
I don't know where the road will lead
We may not find the things we want
But we will find the things we need
And all we need is love
Using things and loving people
Brings you happiness I've found
Using things and loving people
Not the other way around
Using things and loving people
That's the way it's got to be
I see dark clouds coming my way
I know they're gonna try to rain on me
They're almost here but I must say
I'm just as happy as can be
Just because I've got Jesus on my mind
Just because I've got Jesus on my mind
The situation might look so awful grim
But that's when I just stop and get my mind on Him
Just because I've got Jesus on my mind
I see a giant right in my path
I know he's gonna try to do me in
I'm not the least bit afraid of him
Just because I've got Jesus on my mind
Just because I've got Jesus on my mind
The situation might look so awful grim
But that's when I just stop and get my mind on Him
Just because I've got Jesus on my mind
Don't you know I've got Jesus on my mind
Don't you know I've got Jesus on my mind
Don't you know I've got Jesus on my mind
Don't you know I've got Jesus on my mind
Don't you know I've got Jesus on my mind
You gave me love when nobody gave me a prayer.
You gave me love when nobody gave me a prayer.
You gave me love when nobody gave me a prayer.
And helped me start all over again.
I've never seen the Eiffel Tower.
I've never seen the streets of Rome.
But I'll see the greatest wonder that day when I go home.
I'll see him smile open His arms and walk my way
I'm gonna look into His eyes someday
I may not see that much of riches
I may not see that much of fame
My first word will be Daddy
My first step to Your arms
Let me have a baby's charm
Even though the world says I'm a man
You know that I want to grow up
I cry when I get hungry
And when I've disobeyed
Please feed me till I'm older
Then feed me when I'm old
With a brand new thirsty soul
Even though the world says I'm a man
You know that I want to grow up
I need to be still and let God love me
I need to be still and let God love me
When this old world starts to push and shove me
I need to be still and let God love me
I need to relax and let God take over
I need to relax and let God take over
He'll take this load off my shoulders
I need to relax and let God take over
When there's trouble all around me
And my soul cries out for rest
When I feel that I'm falling
Even though I've done my best
When decisions get so heavy
And there are answers that I need
I know it's time to just be still and let
I need to be still and let God love me
I need to be still and let God love me
When this old world starts to push and shove me
I need to be still and let God love me
I need to be still and let God love me
I need to be still and let God love me
When this old world starts to push and shove me
He used to walk this earth
With sandals on His feet
Just to hear Him speak
With His hands He'd heal the sick
And open the eyes that could not see
And just to think that life that lives in Him
Now He's walking in my shoes
He's singing with my voice
He's reaching out with my hands
Helping someone make the right choice
He's smiling with my face
He's showing me the way
And I'm so glad that I can be a part
He's living in my heart
With his voice He'd speak
And calm an angry sea
Yet He said that one day
We'd do greater things than He
He forgave the men that nailed Him to a tree
And just to think that His spirit
Now lives inside of me
Now He's walking in my shoes
He's singing with my voice
He's reaching out with my hands
Helping someone make the right choice
He's smiling with my face
He's showing me the way
And I'm so glad that I can be a part
He's living in my heart
Now He's walking in my shoes
He's singing with my voice
He's reaching out with my hands
Helping someone make the right choice
Now He's smiling with my face
He's showing me the way
And I'm so glad that I can be a part
You laugh and play your part
You fool the world but not your heart
You thought it all would pass in time
The melody and all the rhyme
But still the music starts when she walks by
Some love songs never die
They haunt your memory
The pain will fade and the tears will dry
But some songs will never die
You found someone to take her place
Time may take you many loves apart
Late at night when your alone
And all your thoughts have come and gone
You'll hear her music echo in your heart
Some love songs never die
They haunt your memory
The pain will fade and the tears will dry
But some songs will never die
Some love songs never die
They haunt your memory
And even though you can say goodbye
Fancy shoes that dance in time.
They did sing a gypsy rhyme.
Just a boy of seventeen.
Silver spangles in her eyes.
And the taste of life's sweet wine.
And stir the darkness in my mind.
Little know who haunts my mind.
And it dances in my head.
Slumber softly in their beds.
Silver spangles in her eyes.
And the taste of life's sweet wine.
Silver spangles in her eyes.
As we sit out on the back porch
And the night begins to show
It feels good just to be here and unwind
And the sun is slowly setting
A reflection in your eyes
And when you look my way
The thought that's crossed my mind
And you know there ain't no love
There ain't no love like yours for me
And it's plain my love
You've been heaven sent made specially
There ain't no love like yours for me
And we'll remain in love
With the kind of love
Most lovers never see
You always sit and listen
When I feel the need to talk
When I'm feeling insecure and filled with doubt
You've got the way to make me happy
And it's right there in your smile
And love for me will always be what I can't do without
There ain't no love like yours for me
And it's plain my love
You've been heaven sent made specially
There ain't no love like yours for me
Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk from the hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
Tears from little sister
Without a patch for the party to go
She is living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it in the snow on the ground
Trying to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe let the snow come through
And the chills to the bone
Where you can live in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Living on dreams ain't easy
And the chills stay away
You know that faith is your foundation
Where you can live in the love of the common people
Be the pride in the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Somewhere I heard these words one time
Love is like a clinging vine
I've never had to cling to you
Our love is not a clinging vine
Somewhere I let read these words one time
Love is like a glass of wine
Aging made it sweeter and so fine
It's no better now than before
Our love is not a glass of wine
Let them write their fancy words
For people who have never heard or tasted
A love like yours and mine
Ours is not a clinging vine
And its certainly not a glass of wine
Our love is not a clinging vine
And its certainly not a glass of wine
Somewhere there should be
For all the world to see
A statue of a fool made of stone
Who let love slip through his hands
And then just let him stand there all alone
And there on his face
A gold tear should be placed
To honor the million tears he's cried
And the hurt in his eyes would show
So everyone would know
Concealed is a broken heart inside
All the world can see
Then inscribe The World's Greatest Fool
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a night so long
The moon just went behind a cloud
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a robin weep
That means he's lost the will to live
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
Who's the one who tied you shoe when you were young
And knew just when to come and see what you had done
When you told her your first love was over
She'd met someone older mama mama
Results graduation mama mama
When you introduced you future bride
As you walked down the isle through tears you saw her
This is a story about Billy and Sue
They were as in love as were any two
And yet Billy had to die
And when you hear the reason why
You'll hang your head and cry
Billy and Sue met the first day of school
You'd have to be a fool
This mutual agreement of love and trust
They would travel the road
And when Billy was old enough to take a wife
He was old enough to fight for his country
Sues letters came every day
To fight for his country and the girl he loved
That's a soldiers only pay
But then Billy heard no more from Sue
He was worried sick but what could he do
The bullets were screaming as he hugged the ground
His hope his fate was almost gone
And then like a miracle the letter appeared
Billy tore the letter open and he read dear john
A look came over Billy that would scare a ghost
Familiar look seen on soldiers coast to coast
And even though the air was filled with lead
Billy jumped up they shot him dead
Billy was buried in a far away grave
It read for his country his life he gave
But that epitaph was only a part
Children were laughing then
I could hear a bluebird sing
And the warmth of your arms
Oh the warmth of your arms
And we were walking by the shore
You said you'd marry me
Now I cry but can't you see
These teardrops in my eyes
They're for all we planned
Our whole lives through
Things we'll never do
Things we'll never do
Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Still in love with you
Today I passed you on the street
Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
And he looked so satisfied
And you know he looked so satisfied
It hurts to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss
How much that I miss yeah
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
I'll be in New York City
When the lights shine bright tonight
Where my woman waits for me
Arms that hold me tenderly
Lips as sweet as honeycomb
Love that waits for me alone
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
The eyes of a New York woman
Are eyes that can hold a man
She swept me off of my feet
Made my world seem so complete
I'll never have to look for more
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
Thought I wasn't ready
For the tie that binds
But I lost my heart to her
When her eyes met mine
Now I see her differently
I've got to make her mine
So I'll make my home Fun City
And let the lights shine bright on me
I'll never have to look for more
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
The eyes of a New York woman
Are eyes that can hold a man
She swept me off of my feet
Made my world seem so complete
I'll never have to look for more
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
When you hold me in your arms so tight
That you're in love with me
Lips are sweet as candy
The taste stays on my mind
For another cup of wine
But I don't need a cure
I'll just stay addicted
And hope I can endure
All the good love when we're all alone
That you're in love with me
All the good love when we're all alone
I see the sunlight in her hair
I feel the warm smile that she wears
She has no recipe for love
And I just can't get enough
From the distance of my mind
To wake up to my destiny
It's time to face reality
It's only love that I feel inside
But I'll get by somehow
I tell myself that it's not real
There's nothing left for me to feel
I'll just be going on my way
Tomorrow brings another day
It's only love that I feel inside
But I've got to be strong
It's only love but I know I'll get by
I'll take my heart and pride and just throw them aside
And it's tearing me all up inside
Because I like what you're doing
And it's something I've never tried
You're tempting me to come on strong
And when I look in your eyes girl
There's no way to tell right from wrong
So pass the apple and give me a bite
My resistance is low and I just can't fight it
I don't think I can ask you to leave
So pass the apple Eve
You make me reach out for more girl
I'm really coming alive
But you better think what you're doing
Before you get us both satisfied
So pass the apple and give me a bite
My resistance is low and I just can't fight it
Now I know I can't ask you to leave
So pass the apple Eve
I can't leave you alone
Give me a bite I just can't fight it
Pass the apple and give me a bite
My resistance is low and I just can't fight it
Now I know I don't want you to leave
So pass the apple Eve
Raindrops are falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
So I just did me some talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
He's sleeping on the job
But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Where have the people gone
Look through the window
Seems like I'm the only one around.
All of the streets are bare
Don't have to wait for a seat at the movie
Plenty of classrooms everyplace
And it looks like we're ready
To give it one more try
This time there'll be no alibi
I just can't help believing
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty morning
And the promise of tomorrow in her eyes
And I just can't help believing
When she's lying close beside me
And my heart beats with the rhythm of her sigh
This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
I just can't help believing
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
That my fingers fold around it like a glove
And I just can't help believing
When she's whispering her magic
And her tears are shining honey sweet with love
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
For more than just a day
I'm at the railroad station in st. Paul
But girl I'd love to see you most of all
Ever since the train left Montreal
Thought I'd always love this life I'm living
But now I know I love you most of all
Many times before I know I swore that I'd come home to stay...
But it always seems that foolish dream and trains got in my way
Tomorrow there will be snow in Minnesota
But I won't be around to watch it fall
I'll be heading for that old familiar station...
I miss ya baby... Most of all

A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all
No love at all is a poor old man
No love at all is a child in the street
And that's a long row to hoe
No love at all is a troubled young girl
And it's a pretty short fall
Now people believe me
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all
Oh you got to believe me
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all

Been sleeping in your head
Those old dark clouds
Been hanging around your head
But all your hard times
Will vanish in the wind
When the mighty clouds of joy
Let your love seize us
When the mighty clouds of joy
Those old storm clouds
Are slowly drifting by
And those old raindrops
Are fading from your eyes
Gonna shine on us again
When the mighty clouds of joy
Let your love seize us
When the mighty clouds of joy
Won't you let your love seize us
Let us find sweet peace within
When the mighty clouds of joy
Maybe I'll be the things I dream
And not the things I seem
Maybe I'll get to change the world
Just as happy as it seems
Maybe I'll learn to face the truth
And like the truth I face
Maybe I'll get to find myself
Before I'm lost in space
Just as faithful as it seems
Just as faithful as it seems
She was just sixteen and all alone
So we grew up together
Now things were bad and she was scared
But whenever I would cry
She'd calm my fears and dry my tears
With a rock and roll lullaby
Sing it sweet and clear
We made it through the lonely days
When mama sang a song
Now I can't recall the words at all
It don't make sense to try
In that rock and roll lullaby
Nothing moves my soul
Like the sound of a good old rock and roll lullaby
Nothing moves my soul
It's lonely out tonight
And the feeling just got right for a brand new love song
Somebody done somebody wrong song
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
So sad that it makes everybody cry
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
So sad that it makes everybody cry
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home

And Changed my point of view
I can't believe the things
I'm looking forward to
Would you believe I'm thinking about
And a two story house
And too many bills to pay
Too make me happy living that way
I used to play such a game
I'd go looking for love
And hide if it saw me
You could find with my friends
Hanging out on the street
Now they're wondering where I could be
Well it's Saturday night
And it's just you and me
Snuggled up on the couch
Would you believe I'm thinking about
And a two story house
And too many bills to pay
Too make me happy living that way
If we don't get to Paris
It won't break our hearts
We'll just pack up the kids
And go to Yellowstone Park
I want a two car garage
And a two story house
And too many bills to pay
Too make me happy living that way
All I want is you baby
All I want is you baby
All I want is you baby
Somethings bound to go wrong
But she looks in my eyes
Everything will turn out alright
Each morning I awake and fine
The sunlight softly shining in her hair
And then I realize that I'm only
There's magic in her eyes
That makes me come alive
Everything will turn out alright
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you
Baby nothing could go wrong with you
Oh what she does to me
When she makes love to me
Everything will turn out alright
With a heart that's been torn.
From the moment she was born.
But never tears of joy.
Painted heartbreak blue.
Never will come true.
Fell on this little boy.
And made a broken toy.
A broken life takes its place.
That one day will break toys of its own.
Give back the innocence stolen from them.
A broken life takes its place.
That one day will break toys of its own.
Early this morning I opened my eyes
And caught you watching me sleep
I'm getting new looks from an old lover again
Was written all over your face
I'm getting new looks from an old lover again
It's such a good feeling
Knowing I that I can still win what I've already won
It's great to know we still can be lovers and friends
It's such a good feeling
Knowing it's better than I ever thought it could be
Because of new looks from an old lover again
I feel your fingers touching my body and mind
As they brush through my hair
I'm getting news looks from an old lover again
And deep in your eyes I see the hunger
That only true love can feed
I'm getting new looks from an old lover again
It's such a good feeling
Knowing I that I can still win what I've already won
It's great to know we still can be lovers and friends
It's such a good feeling
Knowing it's better than I ever thought it could be
Because of new looks from an old lover again
Two broken hearts lonely looking like houses where nobody lives
Two people both having so much pride inside
Neither side forgives
Angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
It's my belief pride is the chief cause
In the number of husbands and wives.

It's my belief pride is the chief cause
We live in the modern age
Where love is fast like a turning page
The friends we used to know
Like the times we've had
Whatever happened to old fashioned love
The kind that would see you through
The kind of love my Momma and Daddy knew
The kind that would last through the years
Today is all we've planned
We say tomorrow we'll understand
The kind that would see you through
The kind of love my Momma and Daddy knew
The kind that would last through the years
For now the tenderness
And it's hard to find
The kind that would see you through
The kind of love my Momma and Daddy knew
The kind that would last through the years
When you hold me in your arms so tight
That you're in love with me
Lips are sweet as candy
The taste stays on my mind
For another cup of wine
But I don't need a cure
I'll just stay addicted
And hope I can endure
All the good love when we're all alone
That you're in love with me
All the good love when we're all alone
Raindrops are falling on my head

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Kinda hard to love a guy like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better that your own kin did
From the very start it's my own fault
What happens to my heart
You see I've always known you'd go
So you just do what you gotta do
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss
Those sweet lips again
Find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can
Now I know it'll make you feel sad
And make you feel so bad
They say you don't treat me me like you should
They got ways to make you feels no good
I guess they got no way to know
I've had my eyes wide open from the start
The part of you that they'll never see
Is the part you've shown to me
So you just do what you gotta do
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss
Those sweet lips again
Find that dappled dream of yours
I'm at the railroad station in st. Paul

Been sleeping in your head

Been hanging around your head
But all your hard times
Will vanish in the wind
When the mighty clouds of joy
Let your love seize us
When the mighty clouds of joy
Those old storm clouds
Are slowly drifting by
And those old raindrops
Are fading from your eyes
Gonna shine on us again
When the mighty clouds of joy
Let your love seize us
When the mighty clouds of joy
Won't you let your love seize us
Let us find sweet peace within
When the mighty clouds of joy

Now I can't recall the words at all
It don't make sense to try
In that rock and roll lullaby
Nothing moves my soul
Like the sound of a good old rock and roll lullaby
Nothing moves my soul
These boots ain't traveled through
And I'm losing all my heart
But the point of no returning
Something feels mighty wrong
First you came to own my body
Now you're out to get my soul
And I can't tell which is you
And I only have the hope of feeling free
Everybody's calling out directions
Now I never had a mind
That took too kindly to direction
But lately I don't know
Are you anywhere bound
Does a man have to admit he's lost
Before he can be found
When the miles keep rolling by
And he's scared and he don't know why
Does he come right out and shout
Or does he let his roads
When I wake up in the morning feeling like
And the day comes crashing down around about the time my feet hit the floor
There ain't nothing I know
Laced with sweet cherry wine
And I recall that I ain't got a one
And I fell so doggone bored
Lord that dying sounds like it could be fun
There ain't nothing I know
Laced with sweet cherry wine
When I'm going to pot
Just give me a shot of sweet cherry wine
I just can't do without it
There ain't no doubt about it
That nothing can warm up
With sweet cherry wine
This cold heart of mine
I said sweet cherry wine
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
All my life I was alone
Didn't think I'd find my part
Now I see there's joy inside your arms
Every day I searched for the star
That never was in the sky
And now I see this star is on earth
And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that I would be
If I gave you a chance to come inside my life
And I am happier than the morning sun
And that's the way it will always be
That's the way it will always be
Ever since the day you came inside of my life
And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
Bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
Happier than the morning sun
That's the way you said it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the stars above
That's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside of my life
I believe that everyone should be
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
You say you've found somebody new but that won't stop my loving you
I just can't let you walk away forget the love I had for you
Yes I could find somebody too but I don't want no one but you
How can you leave without regret am I that easy to forget
Before you leave be sure you find you want his love much more than mine
Yes I could find somebody too but I don't want no one but you
How could you leave without regret you're not that easy to forget
Show me that smile again
We're nowhere near the end
The best is ready to begin
I look into your eyes and see them shining out
Holding you close this way
Is like having summer everyday
As long as we got each other
We can take anything that comes our way
Promise me here and now
Will never come between us
As long as we got each other
We can take anything that comes our way
As long as we got each other
We can take anything that comes our way
The best is ready to begin
We can take anything that comes our way
They held up as long as they could
All those people at my feet
I was so smug in my prime
Up at the height of my conceit
I got my back up against the wall
You know this ain't the first time
I got my back up against the wall
It's been a long fight
I didn't know I'd have to make no
It's gonna be more than I can take now baby
I thought I'd never fall
I got my back up against the wall
I got my back against the wall
Sometimes I find myself with my back against the wall
I got my back against the wall
Just like a lot of good people now
They love me all around the world
I can't understand you girl
I wonder why the pure in heart
And I wonder what the Lord has made
Now that he plans to throw away
I thought I would never fall
I got my back against the wall
Sometimes you find yourself down on the street
I got my back against the wall
Sometimes no matter how hard you try
I got my back against the wall
Last night I started to cry
And I cried all night long
I got my back against the wall
Last night I started to pray
And I prayed all night long
And that's when I got that feeling y'all
It's just a part of life
Bad news travels like wildfire
Good news travels slow
They call me old wildfire
Always getting into trouble
And leaving little girls who hate to see me go
I picked peaches down in Georgia
Lumber jacked up in Maine
I've been hired and fired and jailed
In every state you can name
Always getting into trouble
And leaving little girls who hate to see me go
The stories is the same
From one state to the other
I have to change my name
Always getting into trouble
And leaving little girls who hate to see me go
Now they tried to hang me down in Oakland
And they did in San Frisco
And I broke their rope
And they had to let me go
Always getting into trouble
And leaving little girls who hate to see me go
I see hard times coming
I'd never leave you behind
I hear rumors spreading
Now we've got to stand together
With our hearts again
I see a brand new Heaven
Our love will live forever
Our love will live forever
Our love will live forever
Our love will live forever
Our love will live forever
Our love will live forever
Our love will live forever
Our love will live forever
Our love will live forever
Of life's ups and down
The downs have been few
I guess you could say
That it's all because of you
If anyone should ever write my life story
For whatever reason there might
Between each line of pain and glory
That ever happened to me
That ever happened to me
That I've spent hurrying
If anyone should ever write my life story
For whatever reason there might
Between each line of pain and glory
That ever happened to me
Oh you're the best thing
That ever happened to me
I know you're the best thing
I never knew I could be so sad
Since you been gone from me
I've had nothing but misery
I know I could search this whole wide world
But I'd never find another girl like
I still see Bobbie's face
I feel her warm embrace
Even though she's far away
And there she'll stay
I still can remember that very day
Bobbie turned around and she walked away
Leaving me standing there with a broken heart
Never giving me a reason why we should part
Please come back just one more time
Hang out with the new kids
You were born again today
You were born again today
Hang out with the new kids
You were born again today
You were born again today
Hang out with the new kids
You were born again today
You were born again today
Hang out with the new kids
You were born again today
As a child I never stopped believing
The joy that filled our house on Christmas Day
By the fire we loved to share the meaning
With songs we sang all through the holiday
The one of peace on earth for everyone
No matter where you are you're not alone
Love will find you in December
By the tree we welcomed back the memory
To talk about how fast the year's gone by
So blessed seeing all the family
The one that keeps the Christmas dream alive
No matter where you are you're not alone
Love will find you in December
When the trees are covered up with snow
In your heart you'll know it's time to go home
No matter where you are you're not alone
Love will find you in December
Didn't it rain children
Talk about rain oh my Lord
Didn't it fall didn't it fall
Didn't it fall my Lord didn't it rain
Didn't it rain children
Talk about rain oh my Lord
Didn't it fall didn't it fall
Didn't it fall my Lord didn't it rain
Oh it rained forty days
And it rained forty nights
There was no land no where in sight
God send the angel to spread the news
He haste his wings and away he flew
To the East to the West
To the North to the South
All day all night how it rained how it rained
Didn't it rain children
Talk about rain oh my Lord
Didn't it fall didn't it fall
Didn't it fall my Lord didn't it rain
Some at the window some at the door
Some said Noah can't you take a little more
No no said Noah no no my friends
The nature got to keep you can't get in
I told you I told you a long time ago
You wouldn't hear me you disobey me
Lord send the angel a warning to you
It began to rain and now you are through
Well it rained forty days
Forty nights without stopping
When the rain stopped dropping
Knock at the window knock at the door
Can't you take any more
No no my brothers you are full of sin
God has the key you can't get in
Would you listen how it rained
Didn't it rain children
Talk about rain oh my Lord
Didn't it fall didn't it fall
Didn't it fall my Lord didn't it rain
Didn't it rain children
Talk about rain oh my Lord
Didn't it fall didn't it fall
It was the hottest day of August
All of us were down by the banks of the Paint Rock River
I was next in line to be baptized
At the innocent age of ten
And I'll never forget I remember it yet
The taste of that clear pure water
And that preacher's words still fill my head
And I hear them now and then he said
Do you wanna go to heaven
And I said yeah just lead me on
Take my hand can you feel that feeling
And I said yes just lead me on
It was the hottest day of summer
And our final high school dance was just about over
I was old enough for the taste of love
When boys turn into men
And I'll never forget I remember it yet
The taste of that clear pure water
But the preacher's words I barely heard
As sweet Bonnie Lou gave in she said
It was a lonely night in August
She was sitting at the end of the bar when I saw her
And with a little wine and an little time
She would be a prize to win
Now I'll never forget I remember it yet
The taste of that clear pure water
But that preacher's words could not be heard
Won't you give me an appointment
Been so long since I've had a check up
I know there's a long line waiting
Can you tell me is he in today
Show me to the man with the healing hands
And tell him to come and take me by my hand
Can you forgive me for the way I've been living
Taking more than giving
I'm just tired of living this way
Show me that road to salvation
And lead me away from temptation
And close the door to hate
I thought I'd see you smile
When I walked in the door
Thought those arms of yours would be open wide
The way they were before
Why do you look at me
Like I'm some stranger now
When you used to hold me so tight
Don't you love me anymore
Have your learned to live your life without me
When did the fire go out
Where did the feeling go
Did it slip away when I wasn't there
Baby now I've come home
I thought you'd want me babe
I was so sure you'd ask me to to stay
I thought you'd need this too
Guess it didn't work out that way
Don't you love me anymore
Have you learned to live your life without me
Don't you love me anymore
When did the fire go out
Where did the feeling go
When you used to hold me so close baby
Don't you love me anymore
Have your learned to live your life without me
Don't you love me anymore
Don't you love me anymore
When you were a dream to me
You turned into a memory
And you became a part of me
That you still remembered me
I thought that it was fantasy
And when I said great ways
To find the end of the rainbow
There were different kinds of goals
Till we turned around
And walked into a fairy tale
Fell into a wishing well
I found you in a fairy tale of time
I believe all of this is destiny
Now I'm where I want to be
There is no other place for me
And when I said great ways to find
The end of the rainbow
There were different kinds of goals
Till we turned around
And walked into a fairy tale
Fell into a wishing well
I found you in a fairy tale
A story that I'll never tell
In the western part of Texas
90 miles from of San Antone
There's a place I go each summer
When I get the urge to roam
I stand out on the highway
If I couldn't catch a ride I'd walk
Let's go to Garner State Park
Come on along to Garner State Park
Where the prettiest girls in Texas
Parade their city slicking clothes
And bought some boots and western wear
We swam all through the day
And that's when it gets dark
Let's go to Garner State Park
We gotta go to Garner State Park
At the dance I met a girl
She was from old Houston town
She was the queen of the park
She was the prettiest girl around
We walked down to the water
Come on and go to Garner State Park
Pretty Cloud to Houston town
San Antone and everywhere around
Next thing I knew it was 4 am
She said my Mother's surely worried
And with the Texas sky above
We couldn't help that we had fallen in love
When you're at Garner State Park
But the summer was soon over
And we had to say goodbye
I said we'll see each other next year
As a tear fell from her eye
When I came I knew no sorrow
Now I'm leaving with a broken heart
From Garner State Park
When you're at Garner State Park
I'll be back again next year
I'll be back again next year
I'll be back again next year
I'll be back again next year
I'll be back again next year
I'll be back again next year
I'll be back again next year
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
From God our heavenly Father
The blessed Angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Savior lay
They found Him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas
All others doth deface
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
But still need help somehow
But my heart still can dream
So here's my life long wish
But for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal the heart
Everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
As children we believed
The grandest sight to see
Wrapped beneath our tree
But Heaven surely knows
That packages and bows
The hurting human soul
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal the heart
Everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
What is this illusion called
The innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief
Can we ever find the truth
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal the heart
Everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal the heart
Everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
This is my only lifelong wish
Woman I hear what you say.
Now and then you've gotta get away.
Never knowing where you're going or what you might do.
Stop my world from falling apart.
Last night I had a dream.
To the arms of another man.
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light from now on
Our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Our troubles will be miles away
Here were are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
With many a winding turn
That leads us to who knows where
Strong enough to carry him
His welfare is my concern
No burden is he to bear
He won't encumber me at all
I'm laden with sadness
That everybody's heart
Isn't filled with gladness
From which there is no return
While we're on our way to there
Doesn't weigh me down at all
He don't love you like I love you
He don't love you like I love you
For the new love that you've found
He uses all the great quotations
Says the things I wish I could say
When the final act is over
And you're left standing all alone
When he takes his bow and makes his exit
I grew up in the void place south of Heaven
Couldn't find the Lord to save my life
How can you expect to find
So I talked to the Man
I said what's the deal now
He was kind and he said
Then I reached into my soul and bought a one way ticket
The only price I paid was some friends who often say
Oh no here he comes and he's got religion
Oh no now you know that's all we'll hear
Ain't it hard to believe that life's sweetest story
Still finds it's way and falls upon deaf ears
Well I have to admit that my conversation
Gets around to the message of my song
Tell me how can we go out and teach all nations
If we haven't heard the lesson here at home
And I guess when your life's been blessed like mine has
You just naturally want to let others know
So my friend if we meet by the gates of Glory
I wanna be the one to say I told you so
Oh no here he comes and he's got religion
Oh no now you know that's all we'll hear
Ain't it hard to believe that life's sweetest story
Still finds it's way and falls upon deaf ears
Oh no here he comes and he's got religion
Oh no now you know that's all we'll hear
Ain't it hard to believe that life's sweetest story
Still finds it's way and falls upon deaf ears
Oh no here he comes and he's got religion
Oh no now you know that's all we'll hear
Ain't it hard to believe that life's sweetest story
You almost have to lose your mind
To find yourself sometimes
You have to close your eyes to see
Just when I thought I'd reached the end
You made it easy to be me
You're the wall I hide behind
You shelter me from time to time
When I feel like giving in
You're the door that I walk through
When I need someone to turn to
You're my best friend
I guess that's how love's supposed to be
When there's no one else around
I fall down to the ground
I feel so tall down on my knees
You're the wall I hide behind
You shelter me from time to time
When I feel like giving in
When I need someone to turn to
You're my best friend
Why should my heart be lonely
When Jesus is my portion
A constant friend is He
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
For His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
Let not your heart be troubled
His tender work I hear
And resting on His goodness
I lose my doubts and fears
But one step I may see
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
For His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
Whenever I am tempted
Whenever clouds arise
When songs give place to sighing
When hope within me dies...
I draw then closer to Him
From care He sets me free
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He cares for me
I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
For His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
His eye is on the sparrow
When ya hold me in your arms so tight
I'll just stay addicted and hope I can endure
All the good love when we're all alone
When I in awesome wonder
The worlds thy hands have made
And I hear the rolling thunder
The universe displayed
When Christ shall come
With shouts of acclamation
What joy shall fill my heart
My God how great thou art
My savior God to thee
My savior God to thee
Why did you make me human
Why did you make me human
I've got the best girl in the world
But make her understand
When I make the tears fall from her eyes
Forgive me for I apologize
Oh and when I make I break her heart
And tear it all apart
Why did you make me human
I've got to work everyday
So little love and so little pay
I know I can't do nobody no wrong
Long enough to sing a song
And people who believe in music
Are the happiest people I've ever seen
So clap your hands and stomp your feet
Lift your voices to the sky
God loves you when you sing
Music is the universal language and love is the key
So take your brother by the hand
And sing along with me
And find out what it really means
And held your loving hands
And thought that fate
Then someone stole my angel
And I lost what I loved most
I may never get to Heaven
But I once came very close
I may never play a golden harp
Or spread some angel wings
Or walk a golden staircase
While the distant chorus sings
But once I held your sweet love
And felt your tender touch
I may never get to Heaven
But I didn't miss it much
I may never get to Heaven
But I didn't miss it much
And if I can't have you
You know I miss you nightly
When you're not at home
To hear your knock on my door
So just come back in a hurry
The truth was all around me
But I closed my eyes and ears
I went looking for the answers somewhere else
Now I've learned to listen
When I used to only hear
And I found the answers inside myself
I can see Heaven's heartbeat
In the stars that shine above
And I can feel the power
With all my imperfections
There's still a place for me
I'm finding how good life can be
A thousand different teachers
Tried to teach me how to sing
But none of them could show me harmony
I feel so much better now
Singing in the key of love
With a different drummer keeping time for me
I can see Heaven's heartbeat
In the stars that shine above
And I can feel the power
With all my imperfections
There's still a place for me
I'm finding how good life can be
In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
As long as I'm with you
By the shifting sea sand
With your hand in my hand
Way up on the mountains
Or way down in the valley
In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
As long as you are there
Even in a far away land
By the shifting sea sand
With your hands in my hand
As long as you are there
Tell me will you be there
It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth goodwill to men
From heavens all gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing
O ye beneath life's crushing load
Whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing
Oh rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing
By prophets seen of old
Shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall own
And the whole world send back the song
The chimes of time ring out the news
Another day is through
Someone slipped and fell
Your courage to renew
Do not be discouraged
For I bring hope to you
What He's done for others
It is no secret what God can do
You'll always feel at home
Wherever you may roam
There is no power can conquer you
While God is on your side
Just take Him at His promise
Don't run away and hide
What He's done for others
It is no secret what God can do
This is a song for those Jesus hearted people
This ones for the way
Them Jesus hearted people treated me
I came across a Norman Rockwell
And the pictures on the page
Brought to mind familiar faces
I think everybody knows the kind I mean
This is a song for those Jesus hearted people
The gentle folks at home
That I'd give the world to see
This ones for the way
Them Jesus hearted people treated me
They are an easy going people
Though they are hard set in their ways
And they do not take the chance
Even though the times are changing
And this a song for those Jesus hearted people
Everybody knows one or two
That I'd give the world to see
This ones for the way
Those Jesus hearted people treated me
How I love those Jesus hearted people
This is a song for those Jesus hearted people
Everybody's known one or two
I'd give the world to see
This ones for the way
Them Jesus hearted people treated me
This is a song for those Jesus hearted people
Everybody's known one or two
I'd give the world to see
This ones for the way
Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Bells on bob tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
O what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
O what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
But misfortune seemed his lot
We got into a drifted bank
And then we got upset
O what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
O what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Let earth receive her King
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and Heaven and nature sing
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
The wonders of his love
The wonders of his love
Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long
Let me walk close to Thee.
Just a closer walk with Thee
Daily walking close to Thee
Time for me will be no more
To Thy kingdom shore.
Just a closer walk with Thee
Daily walking close to Thee
Oh daily walking close to Thee
I once was lost in sin
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul
It bathed my heart in love
And wrote my name above
Just a little talk with Jesus made me whole
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry
He will answer by and by
When you feel a little prayer wheel turning
Then you know a little fire is burning
Have a little talk with Jesus makes it right
I may have doubts and fears
My eyes be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
I go to Him in prayer
And He knows my every care
Just a little talk with Jesus made me right
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry
He will answer by and by
Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning
You will know a little fire is burning
Have a little talk with Jesus makes it right
If again you were just mine
The sun for me would always shine
Though fate had ruled that we must part
You're still the keeper of my heart.
Each night now I'm upon my knee
I pray that you remember me
When we are many miles apart
You'll be the keeper of my heart.
All alone without your love
I ask our keeper up above
To guide your footsteps back to me
Without you life's no good you see.
The treasured memories that burn
I keep and I will always yearn
All the love that once was mine
Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Oh it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I hate to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
But as long as you love me so
Oh it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
How I'll hate to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
But as long as you love me so
Let's all go down to the river
He can raise the dead from the grave
He can make the lame walk
He can make the dumb talk
And open up the eyes of the blind
Let's all go down to the river
Jesus is the man at the river
And He washes people's sins away
He can save your soul
If you give Him control
Be ready for that judgment day
Let's all go down to the river
Let's all go down to the river
Let's all go down to the river
Let's all go down to the river
Where you're going to
Don't waste your time
At things you can't undo
What it puts you through
The things it makes you do
And another dream falls through
What people think of you
What's on their minds
And what it puts you through
The things it makes you do
And another dream falls through
And never let it be said
That you've given into
Oh and what it puts you through
And what it makes you do
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross
Where the dearest and best
For the world of lost sinners was slain
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it someday for a crown
It's shame and reproach gladly bared
Then He'll call me someday to my home far away
Where His glory forever I'll share
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
When my life is almost gone
Hold my hand lest I fall
Lead me on to the light
When my work is all done
By the light thou hast shown
That fair city so bright
Where the lamb is the light
Lead me on to the light
It seems like yesterday
I heard the people say
Son you were born to stray
Someday you'll settle down
I guess there'll come a time
Maybe I'll tow the line
Right now I'm doing fine
Rolling from town to town
I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Guitars and ringing tones
In my blood and in my bones
And I'll call it home
When they put me in my grave
Ain't a worry you need to save
Just hang up my rock and roll shoes
I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
So let that motor run
Headed out towards the sun
I'm in the mood for moving on
But I'll be back someday
I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Let me hide myself in Thee
Let the water and the blood
From Thy wounded side which flowed
Save from wrath and make me pure
Could my tears forever flow
Could my zeal no respite know
These for sin could not atone
Simply to Thy cross I cling
While I draw this fleeting breath
When my eyes shall close in death
When I rise to worlds unknown
And behold Thee on Thy throne
Let me hide myself in Thee
Let me hide myself in Thee
I prayed the time would come
When I'd be someone's
Made me feel brand new
Like the brightest morning sunlight
Brighter than the moon at midnight
If every single star fell from the skies
We're all diamonds in the rough
Till someone cares enough
To take an empty heart
Make the feelings start
You were worth the wait
Like the brightest morning sunlight
Brighter than the moon at midnight
If every single star fell from the skies
Like the brightest morning sunlight
Brighter than the moon at midnight
If every single star fell from the skies
I don't have plans and schemes
And I don't have hopes and dreams
Since I don't have you
I don't have fond desires
And I don't have happy hours
I never will ever again
When you walked out on me
And he's been here since then
I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
I never will ever again
When you walked out on me
And he's been here since then
I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
Calling for you and for me
He's waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me
Oh for the wonderful love He has promised
Promised for you and for me
And though we have sinned
He has mercy and pardon
Pardon for you and for me
I began wanting to be with you
Wanting to be seen with you
But why I just couldn't say
You were my lady and lover
I didn't know what I'd discovered
And still the loving is fun
Just like it was when it all began
We started out simply two young friends
But look what we've become
And still the loving is fun
Count the years we've loved everyone
And since the first time we loved
The midnight sun shined all the ways
When I first held your hand
Our feet was slowly sinking into the sand
That ran between our toes
Of one single place any better than you
And after all these years you're still the one
I want my love to know
And still the loving is fun
Just like it was when it all began
We started out simply two young friends
But look what we've become
And still the loving is fun
Count the years we've loved everyone
And since the first time we loved
Just like it was when it all began
We started out simply two young friends
But look what we've become
I don't remember growing older
Swiftly flow the days
Seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers
Blossoming even as we gaze
Swiftly fly the years
One season following another
Laden with happiness and tears
Now they must learn from one another
They look so natural together
Just like two newlyweds should be
Swiftly flow the days
Seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers
Blossoming even as we gaze
Swiftly fly the years
One season following another
Sweet hour of prayer sweet hour of prayer
That calls me from a world of care
And bids me at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes known
In seasons of distress and grief
My soul has often found relief
By Thy return sweet hour of prayer
Sweet hour of prayer sweet hour of prayer
Thy wings shall my petition bear
To him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless
And since he bids me seek his face
Believe his word and trust his grace
I'll cast on him my every care
I play an old piano from nine till a half past one
I was a little bitty baby when my papa hit the skids
And did the best she could to try to raise me right
The men are gonna love and all the women gonna hate
Reminding them of everything they never gonna be
Maybe the beginning of the World War III
Another something or the other too
The city's decorated up for Christmas
All the stores are open late tonight
People hurry through the frozen streets
Every child has a thousand wishes
Every window has a thousand lights
Every soul has a need for peace
There's a star that still outshines the night
You can find it if you close your eyes
Take a walk through Bethlehem
Come and kneel before the Lamb
Good news for every man
Walk though Bethlehem
Every night another TV special
Merchants counting down the shopping days
Every heart longs for more than tinsel
Something more than just a holiday
Come and celebrate the baby King
You don't have to travel anywhere
Faith and hope and love will bring you there
Let's take a walk through Bethlehem
Come and kneel before the Lamb
Good news for every man
Walk though Bethlehem
Take a walk through Bethlehem
Come and kneel before the Lamb
Good news for every man
Walk though Bethlehem
Take a walk through Bethlehem
Come and kneel before the Lamb
Good news for every man
Walk though Bethlehem
Take a walk through Bethlehem
Come and kneel before the Lamb
Good news for every man
Walk though Bethlehem
Let's take a walk through Bethlehem
Come and kneel before the Lamb
Good news for every man
Give us a forecast snowy white.
Can't you hear the prayers
Somebody said it's four feet deep.
I'm gonna choose to keep
The only Christmas for me.
Like the gift around our tree.
Well I know there's more snow
But a tender Tennessee Christmas
Is the only Christmas for me.
Maybe tinsel town's for me.
Bring home a tan for New Year's Eve.
Still I think I'm gonna keep
The only Christmas for me.
Like the gift around our tree.
It's the only place to be.
But a tender Tennessee Christmas
Is the only Christmas for me.
Well I know there's more snow
But a tender Tennessee Christmas
Is the only Christmas for me.
A tender Tennessee Christmas
The first Noel the angel did say
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Born is the King of Israel.
They looked up and saw a star
And so it continued both day and night.
And by the light of that same star
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Then did they know assuredly
And found the Babe in poverty.
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
For want of clothing they did Him lay
Then let us all with one accord
And with His blood mankind hath bought.
For God hath prepared for us all
They don't give medals to yesterday's heroes
No they don't give medals to yesterday's heroes
I mean to borrow one day from tomorrow
And I'm gonna spend it on sunshine and things that I love
I'm gonna reach out and touch every star above
No they don't give medals to yesterday's heroes
Caught in the heat of passion
Out on the edge of town
I tried to get to heaven on a highway
Hungry for satisfaction
I always get let down
And now I'm standing here alone
With nothing but a heartache.
Throwing rocks at the moon
Back talking to the night
Throwing rocks at the moon
Breaking a hole in the sky
Too many cold embraces
Chilling me to the bone
I held her for awhile before I lost her
Nothing but nameless faces
Out in the combat zone
Where love will last you for a moment
And leave you in the shadows.
Throwing rocks at the moon
Back talking to the night
Throwing rocks at the moon
Breaking a hole in the sky.
Shine the light she loves me
Shine the light she let's me go
Got the stars above me
It's the perfect night for
Throwing rocks at the moon.
Throwing rocks at the moon
Throwing rocks at the moon
Back talking to the night
I'm throwing rocks at the moon
Breaking a hole in the sky.
Throwing rocks at the moon
Throwing rocks at the moon
I'm throwing rocks at the moon
Then you came along and changed my point of view
I can't believe the things I'm looking forward to
Would you believe I'm thinking about a
Two car garage and a two story house
And a couple of kids we can brag about
And your two arms to make me happy living that way
I used to play such a game of hide and seek
I'd go looking for love then hide if it saw me
You could find me with my friends hanging out on the street
Now they're wondering where I could be
Snuggled up on the couch watching TV
Would you believe I'm thinking about a
Two car garage and a two story house
And a couple of kids we can brag about
And your two arms to make me happy living that way
We'll just pack up the kids and go to Yellowstone Park
I want a two car garage and a two story house
And your two arms to make me happy living that way
Where the tree of life in eternal bloom
And they tell me that mine eyes shall behold
In the city that is made of gold.
And they tell me that no tears ever come again
Makes me feel so good
I used to walk along the streets at night
I knew there had to be a better life
Than the one I was watching pass by
Then I found You one winter's night
And it changed my life instantly
You took me into Your tender care
Now I feel like I'm walking on air
I never had so much reason to be proud
I couldn't be any higher than I am
No I never want down from Your love
Makes you feel so good
Now I never have to walk alone
I couldn't recommend a better life
Than Your love now that I've tried
There couldn't be any wonder drug
That could make me as happy as You
I touched the edge of eternity
Since I've given my life up to You
I never had so much reason to be proud
I couldn't be any higher than I am
No I never want down from Your love
Now there's such a beautiful life
Passing in front of my eyes
No more staring the stars at night
Because you are my one star
And ever since I saw your light
I never had so much reason to be proud
I couldn't be any higher than I am
No I never want down from Your love
I never had so much reason to be proud
I couldn't be any higher than I am
No I never want down from Your love
I never had so much reason to be proud
I couldn't be any higher than I am
I been rocked to sleep many a night
Then bob and then Tommy and then Dan.
Around god's golden throne.
But I'll always believe this world
And how they change with the times
Maybe it's me who's gone crazy
When love is so hard to come by
And if love never lasts forever
And they say love is the key
And it's not my way to let them lead me astray
It's only that I want to believe
While in their hands is a dying romance
And if love never lasts forever
And if love never lasts forever
I always heard about the great Atlantic
How it humbles you to stand upon it's shore
So I thought I'd take some time to go and see it
Since I had no ties upon me anymore
But I don't know what I'd wasted my time for
To me it's just a pond that's almost dry
If you want to see an ocean
You should see the tears her leaving made me cry
So I headed west to see that famous canyon
That the Colorado cut so deep and wide
I thought seeing something lower down than I felt
Might cheer me up and ease my troubled mind
But I just got disappointed one more time
It's nothing but a pothole in the yard
If you want to see a canyon
You should see the hole she left here in my heart
So now I stand here staring at the Rockies
I've heard they reach right up to heaven's door
They're like that little hole and that blue puddle
And I see now what I should have seen before
Without her life holds no wonders anymore
It's just a little pile of rocks and dirt
If you want to see a mountain
You ought to try getting over her
Mere words could not explain
You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
Taught me how to live again
Cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me thick and thin
Filled with gratitude and love
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You made me feel brand new
Make me feel brand new
Whenever I was insecure
You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me
With you I'll always have a friend
You're someone who I can depend
To walk a path that never ends
My life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
You for having faith in me
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You made me feel brand new
Make me feel brand new
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You made me feel brand new
Make me feel brand new
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You made me feel brand new
I remember the feeling of wanting to die
When you said goodbye
At first the pain of losing you
Tore my poor heart in two
Now I find my prayers weren't lying
If you think I still love you
Never thought I'd see your heart aching
The same girl I once called mine
Right in the middle of a ten cent scenery
Shuffled and stacked on a postcard rack
Cactus Jack drinks coffee black
Tells me it's my lucky day
Five o'clock in the Texas morning
Cold it's been for the longest time
She told me Texas was where she was going
I come and look and she's hard to find
Tells me it's my lucky day
Five o'clock in the Texas morning
I don't know just where I'm gonna find her
Maybe the soldier with the suitcase saw her
She just said she was going to Texas now
I'm looking for the girl with light brown hair
But a beautiful smile
She just said she was going to Texas for a little while
He asks the waitress where I'm from
Probably just a California bum
As I walk out into the night
Five o'clock in the Texas morning
I got a long long ride
Five o'clock in the Texas morning
I got a long long ride
Outside the sun is up
And the wind blows me like a paper cup
If I don't see before I go
Remember what you've seen and what you know
But you remember you and I'll remember me
I want to be on my own
I feel like a baby boy
If you find your true love once again
Please don't do the damn same thing to him
So I'd as soon do without you and be on my own
I want to be on my own
I feel like a baby boy
Just the tapping of your teardrops on the ground
I want to be on my own
I feel like a baby boy
Get outside your shell
Those things don't make you well
You're the broken part of a living fairy tale
I want to be on my own
I feel like a baby boy
And in the middle of an August evening
You can't see her fly
He sang her songs of life
Till the day he dropped by just to say goodbye
Please don't leave me alone
I'll die if you are gone
And the clouds will have passed by her window
Could not stay by her side
She had no time to cry
She loved him in the mornings
And in the evenings too
Till the day he dropped by
To say I don't need you
It ain't me it's the times
It ain't you in my mind
I just got to leave you behind
Please don't leave me alone
The sunlight surely hurts my eyes
I'm a lonely dreamer on a highway in the skies
There were some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you bring back my peace of mind
You're a miracle worker for me
You set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea
You're a worthless woman
She's just like a fixture there
Looking to pull a stare
From the 5 o'clock crowd
For yesterdays papers
And takes the back door out
You're a worthless woman.
Lord give her my smile
And see for me to find a way back home
Sunset Woman nobody needs you
Sunset Woman nobody needs to
Just whistling sadly with my head always bowed
I had many a thing of which to be proud
And then I saw her and my heart sang out loud
It grows on you till it's so strong
You know a good love is like a good song
We walked and talked about the things we adored
Within the rhythm of the rain as it poured
I heard the echo of an old familiar chord
It said a good love is like a good song
It grows on you till it's so strong
You know a good love is like a good song
I said I loved her and she said she loved me
To me those words were like a sweet symphony
We were the happiest duet you'll ever see
And a good love is like a good song
It grows on you till it's so strong
You know a good love is like a good song
I've been missing your loving
Going crazier all of the time
Think I'm losing my mind
Hope your love still remains
Grab a hold and please take control of me
Grab a hold of my soul
I'm gonna take all my crazies away
Please still think of me tonight
Grab a hold and please take control of me
How does your light shine
How does your light shine
I can tell my sister by the flowers in her eyes
I can tell my brother by the flowers in his eyes
Was my last mile it seems
All them dreams don't go around
On the wheel of fortune much
And they don't come around at all
Unless you got that lucky touch
And her sunset orange hair
And I remember river banks
And love so soft and fair
But I left her for a sunrise
That I have never seen
And saw instead a bottle
Now my whole life's a dream
And many men have worn
A few holes in their soul
And I know the years have turned me
Sometimes I just wished
Well he staggers down the sidewalk
You know them dreams don't go round
And they don't come round at all
Unless you got that lucky touch
Unless you got that lucky touch
Ooh I've got to boogie
Lord I've got to boogie
And if the boogie don't get you
Then baby you ain't alive
Oh boy I just got paid
I know things have gone right over the hill
I got me a woman and I fought me a judge
And oh boy I want to dance
And I know some group
Ooh I want to boogie...
Saw Billy Bob on the street
I don't care cause my druggist has come
And I don't feel no pain
The days they grow longer
The nights they grow stronger
You were my lady and I was your man
No reasons for leaving were clear
Years they have passed by
Memories are waysides
To rest on when I'm feeling down
And I know I loved you
There was no one above you
I wish I could see you now
And I hope that you will remember me too
In thoughts of your days cross your mind
Years gone like crazy
I've thought of you lady
I've read all the letters you signed
The winter grows colder and I'm growing old
And this crazy cold is getting me down
And I wished you were here
To scare away my fears
Of to the snow sight and sound
Every love comes in couples
And I'm down in doubles
I really doubt if we'd have too much to say
So you packed up your dreams
And tied them with schemes
And put them away till next year
When your dreams have all gone away
But I should be leaving today
On the East India Company
And the stuff to make you sneeze
Those winds feel just right
By this time tomorrow night
This town don't like me
And the police are after me
Come about as far as I can go
We're the importers of oriental spices
Those winds feel just right
By this time tomorrow night
On the East India Company
And the stuff to make you sneeze
Those winds feel right to me
We're the importers of oriental spices
The whole day through
You can make my dreams come true
The whole day through
You can make my dreams come true
Sure he gives me everything I ask for a kind of love that I never knew
And every night he comes home at the same time
But he'll never ever take the place of you
He kisses me goodbye every morning does the little things you've always used to do
But no matter how he tries it ain't the same thing
So don't try to see me when you come back to town
I finally found myself up straight so please don't drag me down
I'll be good to him I'll make him happy I owe him so much what else can I do
And our little boy already calls him daddy still he'll never ever take the place of you
No he'll never know oh that I still love you so
Not too long ago you said to me I believe it's time you set me free
And she don't mind if I lay out all night
And you said hallelujah this woman sure gets to ya
A singing hallelujah you don't know what good it'll do ya
And it's funny but I could almost hear the sound
And I said hallelujah that woman socked it to ya
Just walked away and blew your mind
But it seems that I'm not too satisfied
With the brand new love that's walking by my side
Cause already there's an old love on my mind
I've been loving you too long to stop now
You are tired and you want to be free
I've been loving you a little too long I don't wanna stop now
With you my life has been so wonderful I can't stop now
I've been loving you too long I've been loving you oh too long
Well he wrote me a letter said he couldn't live without me no more
Hey listen Mister can't you see I've got to get back to my baby once more
Give me a ticket for an airplane...
Well he wrote me a letter...
If you want a little loving you gotta start real slow
He's gonna love you tonight if you just treat him right
Tell him that you love him like you know you should
You gonna get the reputation that you can love your man
And you'll be glad every night that you treated him right
I wanna tell you a story...
He's gonna love you tonight if you just treat him right
And you'll be glad every night that you treated him right
Baby oh baby tell the man at the ticket stand that you've changed your mind
Break my mind break my mind
You know I just can't stand to hear them big jet engines whine
Break my mind break my mind oh Lord
Baby oh baby let me take your suitcases off of the scales in time
Break my mind break my mind...
I never dreamed his footsteps could ever sound so lonely
As they did when he left today
I raised my hand and brushed away your tear as I helplessly stood there
Watching my world walk away
I'm leaving forever he said with his eyes but his lips had nothing to say
I never thought I'd live to see the day I'd be standing in this doorway
Watching my world walk away
I'm leaving forever...
I never thought I'd live to see the day...
Oh baby come home baby come home baby come home please come on home
I see your picture on every wall then I realize that you're not here at all
Come home now baby come home
Well I miss you so much come on home come on home
I love you so much come on home
Oh but you come back baby come back to me and I hope that you still love me
Come home now please come on home
Well I miss you so much...
Well all of those years...
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind
My head is in a spin since he left me behind
I went to see the gypsy to have my fortune read
I went to see the gypsy to have my fortune read
I hung my head in sorrow when she said what she said
Now I can tell you people the news was not so good
I can you people the news was not so good
She said your baby's left you this time he's gone for good
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind
Oh the games people now every night and every day now
While they wile away the hours in their ivory towers
Until they're covered up with flowers in the back of a black limousine
Make one another cry break a heart then we say goodbye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die that the other one's to blame
But neither one will ever give in so we gaze at an eight by ten
They're gonna teach you how to meditate read your horoscope and cheat your fate
And furthermore to hell with hate come on and get on board
Look around and tell me what you see what's happened to you and me
God grand me the serenity to just remember who I am
Turn our back on humanity and we don't give a lot
If you want a do right all day's woman you gotta be a do right all night's man
Take me to heart and I'll always love you and nobody can make me do wrong
A woman's only human this you should understand
She's not just a plaything she's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do right all day's woman you gotta be a do right all night's man
They say it's a man's world but you can't prove that by me
As long as we're together baby show some respect for me
If you want a do right all day's woman you gotta be a do right all night's man
If you want a do right all day's woman you gotta be a do right all night's man
That call was from the office and I guess I'll have to burn the midnight oil again
I watch him in the mirror as I lie and tell him I don't know how late I'll be
The girls all got together and they called to see if I could have some fun tonight
But you know me the only thing I do is go to work and watch TV
And I watch him in the mirror as I lie and tell him I don't know how late I'll be
And tonight I'll cheat again and tomorrow I'll be sorry
God knows his dream would shatter if he knew the devil had me and won't set me free
And do all the things that make your man feel right
And you're never gonna ever have to spend another lonely night
And if his day don't go your way then take it with a little smile
After all it's the ups and downs of love that makes it all worthwhile
You've got to give a little...
Never mind the times when his feet feel the need for freedom
Just as long as they bring him on home to you when you need him
To show you care you gotta be there when he laughs or when he cries
You've got to give a little...
He just caught the Jamestown Ferry it's not a hot day in January
Like he said it'd be if he ever left me
A case of gone was all he carried as he got on the Jamestown Ferry
And he said that gone was all he'd ever need
He was the sweetest piece of heaven I've ever known
He just caught the Jamestown Ferry...
As I walk through his kingdom of honky tonks and bars
I remember how he'd hold me and comfort me with talk
He didn't cuss with every breath he had a soothing Southern Drawl
Made me feel like a lady through it all
He just caught the Jamestown Ferry...
Show me a man that's got a good woman show me
Show me a man that's got a good woman show me
Show me a man that's got a good woman show me a man that's got a good woman
Show me a man that's got a good woman show me a man that's got a good woman
Show me a man that's got a good woman
Show me a woman that's got a good man show me
Show me a woman that's got a good man show me
Show me a woman that's got a good man show me a woman that's got a good man
Show me a woman that's got a good man show me a woman that's got a good man
Show me a woman that's got a good man
Show me two people in love with each other show me
Show me two people in love with each other show me
Show me two people in love with each other show me two people in love with each other
Show me a man that's got a good woman show me
Show me a woman that's got a good man show me
And did he ever sound so low when he said I need you so
He wants to come back home in the name of love
Guess who said that he was wrong and even cried on the telephone
Said he'd be as true as stars above
Guess who said he would do right if I'd let him come home tonight
He wants to come back home in the name of love
Guess who's gonna let him come back to her life once more
No more sadness only smiles he'll be here in a little while
No more sadness only smiles he'll be here in a little while
He said honey you won't be alone for long
I got to make just one more stop to pick up a ring in Little Rock
And I'm gonna head this semi straight for home
Him and that semi been away too long
Ten thousand miles I've missed him it's been a week since I kissed him
The only thing he wants he'll get tonight
Ain't it good to have someone to talk to someone you can trust and be proud of
Ain't it good to know he needs you and always does his best to please you
Ain't it good just be in love
Nights are never cold since I've got strong arms to hold me
Warm lips to kiss me and I feel so good inside
And when you say you love me it makes everything better
I just can't get enough of you
Ain't it good to have someone to talk to...
When it's time for loving you know just how to touch me
You never rush me and I feel so satisfied
And I can hardly wait to feel your arms wrapped around me
And let the love surround me one more time
Ain't it good to have someone to talk to...
I've got that old time religion got that old time religion
And that is why I'm satisfied
Now you ask me if I'm happy do I have peace within
Do I worry bout tomorrow when I reach my journey's end
Well I'm satisfied with my Jesus when he knocks I let him in
He'll go with me through the valley for I know he is my friend
Satisfied satisfied no troubles can ever get me down
When my eyes are closed in death with my Jesus I'll be at rest
Then you'll know I'm satisfied
Now if my friends they all forsake me and they turn me from their door
If they sow no seeds of kindness make the thorns in my path grow
Well it won't matter over yonder when I reach the other side
I'm a gonna sit down by my Jesus satisfied satisfied
I'm satisfied satisfied...
I've got that old time religion got that old time religion
I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got
That could keep me from loving you
And I'm loving every time I'm with you
Just like walking in the sunshine
And as long as we're leaving
And loving the way we want to
The best loved woman alive
I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got
I couldn't care less if they like it or not
As long as you're satisfied
I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got
That could keep me from loving you
And I wake up every morning
With your arms wrapped around me tight
And the feeling I feel
Is exactly the way it should be
Keeps growing every day and night
I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got
I couldn't care less if they like it or not
As long as you're satisfied
I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got
That could keep me from loving you
Smile somebody loves you smile take a look and see
Smile somebody needs you smile take a look at me
I will comfort you I will love you true
I will understand I'll do all I can if you'll just turn around take my hand
Smile somebody loves you...
We're gonna hold on we're gonna hold on we're gonna hold on to each other
Life can be rough sometimes it's kind a real good love is hard to find
But the best love is the one we know and faith we have between us makes it grow
We're gonna hold on we're gonna hold on we're gonna hold on to each other
Some love lives and some love don't we've got the kind of love we want
It brings us happiness all through the day and nothing can ever make it go away
We're gonna hold on we're gonna hold on we're gonna hold on to each other
This time I almost made it came so close to saying no
I almost found the words to make you go
This time I almost made it almost pushed you away
But my heart cried out begging you to stay
Cause you belong to her and you go home to her
I know you steal away I know there'll be another day
That you'll come back again
And you'll say hello friend and I'll reach out my hand
If you're lucky enough
To have someone who loves you
Then be glad that you got
Someone who loves you
Cold lips that were warm
Listen to the wisdom of a fool
When you take his poor heart
And you do something to it
And you think to yourself
You may find that the
Listen to the wisdom of a fool
But you still have time to say
I'm afraid it's too late for me
That you know will be waiting
Hold him close in your arms
And be glad that he's waiting
Only listen to the wisdom of a fool
Like sweet morning dew I took one look at you
And it was plain to see you were my destiny
With my arms open wide I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you and dedicate my life to you
I will go where you lead always there in time of need
And when you lose your will I'll be there to push you up the hill
There's no no looking back for us we've got love sure enough that's enough
You're all you're all I need to get by
Like a robin protects his nest for you I'll do my best
Stand by you like a tree dare anybody to try and move me
Darling in you I found strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher
I know you can make a woman out of a soul that didn't have a goal
You're all you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
All all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
Keep on singing don't stop singing
You're gonna be a star someday
You're gonna make a lot of people happy
When they come to hear you play
I don't remember mama she died when I was born
We lived in a one room shanty but daddy tried to make it a home
When I was only six years old I started singing in the streets
People would throw me pennies so I could daddy make ends meet
They said keep on singing don't stop singing
You're gonna be a star someday
You're gonna make a lot of people happy
When they come to hear you play
They said keep on singing keep the bells a ringing
Spread the music from town to town
There's not enough love in this old world so spread your song around
By the time that I was ten years old I had a little country band
Daddy's eyes were growing dim but I didn't understand
He would be so proud of me each time he'd hear us play
At night he'd call me to his side and daddy would always say
He'd say keep on singing don't stop singing...
He didn't have much money but things didn't seem so bad
I felt just like the queen of the world when I was with my dad
And then one rainy April night daddy called me to his side
He said keep on singing don't stop singing...
It'll have my love behind it.
And it will be a symphony of all you mean to me.
A Very Special Love Song
If there's a melody I'll play it.
I'll play it through especially for you and all the words are true.
A Very Special Love Song
So turn your radio way down low and get near it.
Today I started loving you again
And I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartaches mend
But today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million teardrops that I've cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And that crying time for me had just begun
But today I started loving you again...
Yes today I started loving you again
If my lonely tears could talk I just know what they'd say
Please come back and hold me close and kiss the hurt away
Oh my darling please come kiss the hurt away make it go
It's a lonely world and I love you so
Please come back and hold me close and kiss the hurt away
Smile an everlasting smile a smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you're down cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory let's start a brand new story now my love
Right now there'll be no other time and I can show you how my love
Talk an everlasting words and dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my love I'm here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean a single word I say
It's only words and words are all I have to take your heart away
You think that I don't even mean a single word I say
It's only words and words are all I have to take your heart away
It's only words and words are all I have to take your heart away
Something in the way he moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way he woos me
I don't want to leave him now you know I believe and how
Somewhere in his smile he knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in his style that shows me
I don't want to leave him now you know I believe and how
You're asking me will my love grow I don't know I don't know
You stick around now it may show I don't know I don't know
Something in the way he knows
And all I have to do is think of him
Something in the things he shows me
I don't want to leave him now you know I believe and how
She was my friend when I needed a friend
He was the man who said our love would never end
And there were times when she was feeling down
One of us would always come around
And try to share some other happiness we found
I suppose I should have seen what was happening to me
And now there's only me
And she stole his love away from me
You must think my bed's a bus stop
The way you come and go
I ain't seen you with the lights on
So pack your rusty razor
Don't bother with goodbye
But mine is always dry
I can't stand no more
Don't help me set the table
I won't lay mama's silver
For a man who won't say grace
If home is where the heart is
Then your home's on the street
Turn out the lights and go to sleep
In the beginning there was love
And there was nothing that love couldn't rise above
Those were such good times
Even the sad times were such good times
In the beginning it was us
And it would be that way until we turned to dust
But now it's you and it's me
So much has come between us
It's the beginning of the end once we were lovers now we're friends
We're acting like strangers more and more
It's the beginning of the end now love is just a place we've been
We don't love there anymore
We don't love there anymore
And though the end is now in sight
We'll stay here through another night
And we'll just lie here then and remember when we were lovers
It's the beginning of the end once we were lovers now we're friends
We're acting like strangers more and more
It's the beginning of the end now love is just a place we've been
And we don't love there anymore
This time you won't be dressed up in a coat and tie
And I won't be wearing a wedding gown
There won't be a big reception at your folks house
But it's love we know it's real love the second time around
It's love the second time around
We won't be someone's ex anymore
It's love the second time around
A brand new life is knocking on our door
We both know for better or worse can sure get bad
And without love the tie that binds can't come unwound
But in each other we found satisfaction
And it's love we know it's real love the second time around
It's love the second time around...
It's so easy to fall right in
So you better know how to swim
You'd better watch your step it's hard to read the signs
And some times you have to lose before you can find
You got to give for someone to care
And it can be so nice but love is thin ice
It's so easy to fall right in
So you better know how to swim
You'd better stick to higher ground if you don't want to cry
But if you don't take a chance you'll never learn how to fly
Next thing you know your heart needs repair
It's so easy to fall right in
So you better know how to swim
You better take my advice
Once again we loved and you didn't say you love me
Now do you think my love could be so blind
That I don't see chance we might not make it
And no matter how you fake it I can read between the lines
Will we ever make love in love again
Will the broken love between us ever mend
Oh have we reached the beginning of the end
Will we ever make love ever make love in love again
Our love has float like a river through forever
But long since then we drained that river dry
Now making love is all that's left between us
And each vain attempt to love me brings us closer to goodbye
Well I hope that the friend you've thrown yourself with gets fired and loses his job
I couldn't make you love me you only made me blue
So all in all if the curtain should fall well I hope that falls on you
I will have sweet sweet sweet mental revenge
I will have sweet sweet sweet mental revenge
Well I hope that the train from Caribou Maine runs over your sweet love affair
You walk the floor from door to door and pull out your greasy black hair
You never were just my man no you were never true
So all in all if the curtain should fall well I hope that falls on you
I will have sweet sweet sweet mental revenge
It's over I know you're going away
If you can't stay I don't want you too
I won't miss you now I don't care where you go
I'm glad you've got a friend there in town
And I hope she'll be good to you
What's a number just in case I do
It's good you're gonna be happy
You're right it's the right thing to do
And you couldn't really be happy
If you thought I still care for you
I know you don't love me anymore
And I don't care if you'll ever come back again
But I'll be here just in case you do
There's a place in every bar room
And a verse in every song
For a woman trapped and lonely
By a man that's done her wrong
Now I know it won't be easy
But I need someone to hold me
Or I'm gonna loose my mind
Is there room for another Midnight Angel
Is there room for another midnight angel
Now I thought that neon nightmares
Were like Sunday sermon scares
Till I turn to face the man I loved
And found a pillow there
Ya know sometimes in your life
You may find it hurts to be in love
Specially when you and the one ya love
Already belong to somebody else
You're tied to her and I'm tied to him
And we don't wanna hurt either one of them
When you're married but not to each other
Ya gotta go home in the middle of the night
Try and pretend every things alright
When you're married but not to each other
Make believe that you've been good
Give your love to the one you should
We don't wanna hurt either one of them
When you're married but not to each other
Ya gotta be careful everywhere you go
When you're married but not to each other
You've gotta make up alibis
Hurry up and love him
Hurry up and please him
And when it gets right
You've got to leave him
We don't wanna hurt either one of them
But not to each other
Hurry up and love him
Hurry up and please him
And when it gets right
You've got to leave him
Ya know sometimes in your life
You may find it hurts to be in love
Specially when you and the one ya love
Already belong to somebody else
You're tied to her and I'm tied to him
And we don't wanna hurt either one of them
When you're married but not to each other
Ya gotta go home in the middle of the night
Try and pretend every things alright
When you're married but not to each other
Make believe that you've been good
Give your love to the one you should
We don't wanna hurt either one of them
When you're married but not to each other
Ya gotta be careful everywhere you go
When you're married but not to each other
You've gotta make up alibis
Hurry up and love him
Hurry up and please him
And when it gets right
You've got to leave him
We don't wanna hurt either one of them
But not to each other
Hurry up and love him
Hurry up and please him
And when it gets right
You've got to leave him
Let me be a little girl again
Don't want a lover now... I need a friend
Don't want to talk... and I don't want to smile
I only want to hide... and rest awhile
I don't want to think about the world outside your arms
And everything it calls on me to do
I'm all out of giving... let me take for just a minute
Sometimes I need to be a baby too... and have you
Let me be a little girl again
Don't want a lover now... I need a friend
Don't want to talk... and I don't want to smile
I only want to hide... and rest awhile
Don't want to talk... and I don't want to smile
I only want to hide... and rest awhile
So you sing me to sleep
With a song you just wrote yesterday
And yes I hope you can hear
What the words and the music have to say.
It's so hard to explain
Face to face I just seem to go dry.
But I love you so much
That the sound of your voice can get me high.
On a one way trip to the sun.
So you sing me to sleep
I brush back the hair from your eyes.
And the love on your face
Is so real that it makes me want to cry.
And I know that your song
I'm still in love with you.
So you sing me to sleep
I brush back the hair from your eyes.
And the love on your face
Is so real that it makes me want to cry.
And I know that your song
I'm still in love with you.
I'm still in love with you.
Looking back into the world we knew
When love was such a sweet surprise
Was it beautiful how strangers came to lovers
Like magic right before our eyes
Strangers become friends and friends become lovers
But the same fire that warms the heart can burn
Then it's lovers friends strangers again
Ain't it funny how the circle turns
And looking back I'd do it all again
Although the story's sad but true
Even lovers can be strangers once again
Stranger still I keep on loving you
Strangers become friends...
You don't know who this is but...
The reason I'm calling you is because...
I was going through my man's pockets this morning...
And I just happened to find your name and number...
You might even hang up the phone...
And it's only fair that I let you know...
He's mine... and I love him...
So woman to woman I think you'll understand
If you've ever been in love
Then you know how I feel
Now if you were in my shoes
I've just got to make you see
That you can't take him from me
I just can't step aside
And let you take what is rightfully mine
I ain't gonna let you break up my happy home
I hope you understand...
If you've ever been in love
Then you know how I feel
Now if you were in my shoes
I've just can't step aside
Tonight's my lucky night I know
To tell me he's been thinking of me
And all this time he's changed his mind
That's how I know he's gonna love me
We'll turn out the light
Like we did back then
And we'll start all over
Tonight's my lucky night I'm sure
I've waited for this chance to hold him
And how I see he's needed me
Coming back to live forever
We'll turn out the light
Like we did back then
And we'll start all over
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If being right means being without you
I'd rather live a wrong than right
My mama and daddy say it's a shame
It's a downright disgrace
But as long as I got you by my side
I don't care what my people say
My friends tell me there's no future
In loving a married man
If I can't see you when I want
I'll see you when I can
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
So deeply in love with you
Knowing you got a wife
And two little children
For the gentleness of your touch
Knowing you got somebody else at home
Who needs you just as much
Am I wrong to give my love
Am I wrong for trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
Am I wrong to give my love
Am I wrong for trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
I don't wanna be right
If it means sleeping without you
I don't wanna be right
If it means sleeping alone at night
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
Sleeping single in a double bed
Thinking over things I wish I'd said
I should have held you but I let you go
Sleeping single in a double bed
I'm sleeping single in a double bed
Sleeping single in a double bed
Thinking over things I wish I'd said
I should have held you but I let you go
Sleeping single in a double bed
Don't be frightened my high flying bluebird
All my love songs are just for you
Sing them with me and when you do
Don't be frightened my high flying bluebird
Go on and fly high in the sky
I'll never try to burn your wings
Don't be frightened my high flying bluebird
I followed my heart right into your arms
Like you wanted me to
I thought it was love but it was only a touch
I was fooled by a feeling
Now I'm feeling like a fool
All through the night
You made love so easy to believe
Your touch was so gentle
The feeling was right
But I was wrong for believing you loved me
I followed my heart right into your arms
Like you wanted me to
I thought it was love but it was only a touch
I was fooled by a feeling
Now I'm feeling like a fool
I followed my heart right into your arms
Like you wanted me to
I thought it was love but it was only a touch
I was fooled by a feeling
Now I'm feeling like a fool
Now I'm feeling like a fool
I followed my heart right into your arms
The feelings all come back
And I still see your face
It's strange how the days turned into years
To dreams are already gone
Years of wishing you were here
After all this time you'd think I wouldn't cry
It's just that I still love you after all these years
Nighttime gently falls
I turn around to find you're still not here
I leave the hall light on
In case you come back home
But I've been saying that for years
To dreams are already gone
It's of wishing you were here
After all this time you'd think I wouldn't cry
It's just that I still love you after all these years
It's not over when you stop crying and it's the end when you say goodbye
And it's not finally done when you just walk away from someone
Cause love takes a long time it takes such a long time to die
There'll be times when you're alone you'll softly speak her name
Each one's just about left you one time
Daydreaming through the glass you'll see pictures from the past
Cause love takes a long time it takes such a long time to die
They'll come around to remind you there's love still locked inside
I was wrong you were right
What I really mean to say is
You can kick off all the covers in the middle of the night
You can sleep with the window open wide
Do anything as long as your by my side
You can eat crackers in my bed anytime
A double bed to myself now that you're gone
It's a matter of fact I've got to have you back
I just want you to know
You can kick off all the covers in the middle of the night
You can sleep with the window open wide
Do anything as long as your by my side
You can eat crackers in my bed anytime
You can sleep with the window open wide
Do anything as long as your by my side
You can eat crackers in my bed anytime
You can kick off all the covers in the middle of the night
You can sleep with the window open wide
Do anything as long as your by my side
That's what we used to be
I just wish we'd ended up the way we started out
From one little room where we loved each other
To this big two story house
We wanted the best I'm afraid that's what we've got now
We're the best of strangers
No one could do it any better
We live here separately together
We're the best of strangers
We share a ceiling and a floor
But there's no feeling anymore
We're the best of strangers
We stare at different walls
And most of the time we don't even say goodnight
Except passing in the hall
And then when we do we both apologize
We're the best of strangers
No one could do it any better
We live here separately together
We're the best of strangers
We share a ceiling and a floor
But there's no feeling anymore
We're the best of strangers
We're the best of strangers
Sleeping single in a double bed
Thinking over things I wish I'd said
I should have held you but I let you go
Sleeping single in a double bed
I'm sleeping single in a double bed
Sleeping single in a double bed
Thinking over things I wish I'd said
I should have held you but I let you go
Sleeping single in a double bed
The feelings all come back
And I still see your face
It's strange how the days turned into years
To dreams are already gone
Years of wishing you were here
After all this time you'd think I wouldn't cry
It's just that I still love you after all these years
Nighttime gently falls
I turn around to find you're still not here
I leave the hall light on
In case you come back home
But I've been saying that for years
To dreams are already gone
It's of wishing you were here
After all this time you'd think I wouldn't cry
It's just that I still love you after all these years
I took a vacation down by the ocean
But it's no fun with a heart that's broken
I see lovers walking on the beach at sunset
I wish you were here but you're with another
If I knew where you were
I'd send you a postcard
I wish you were here but you're with another
Flannel shirts Even when they weren't in style
At the movies when the West was really wild
When all of my friends
Now look at everybody
They call us country bumpkins
I'm just glad we're in a country
Where we're all free to choose
I woke up alone the bed was so cold
I learned a lot in just one night
And I don't like this single life
I don't even mind if he says I told you so
I gave it one night that's long enough to know
Could you ring this number for me
There's something wrong
I can't wait for him to call me
That's all it takes to say I love you
I called yellow cab to see where they had taken him last night
Could you ring this number for me
There's something wrong
I can't wait for him to call me
That's all it takes to say I love you
How in the world did you get my number
How did you know he's out of town
I thought we were over long ago
And we shouldn't meet here in this restaurant
When I belong to another man
You're not supposed to be here
You're not supposed to want me
You're not supposed to make me want you
You're not supposed to be here
You're not supposed to tempt me
How did we ever let this happen
We're just supposed to be old friends
I prayed I wouldn't fall back in love with you
But now I pray that it won't end
You're not supposed to be here
You're not supposed to want me
You're not supposed to make me want you
You're not supposed to be here
You're not supposed to tempt me
You're not supposed to be so close to me
You're just supposed to be a memory
You're not supposed to be here
You're not supposed to want me
You're not supposed to make me want you
You're not supposed to be here
You're not supposed to tempt me
We shouldn't meet here at this restaurant
You shouldn't be holding my hand
I shouldn't be wanting what I want
When I belong to another man
You're not supposed to be here
You're not supposed to want me
You're not supposed to make me want you
You're not supposed to be here
You're not supposed to tempt me
How in the world did we let this happen
We're just supposed to be old friends
I prayed I wouldn't fall in love with you
I don't want to tie you down
With some lines spoken in sorrow
With some hopes pinned on tomorrow
You've got your bedroll and your guitar
I don't want the phone to ring
I can't talk when I'm crying
Your voice shakes when you're lying
Saddle the wind and ride for the sun
But if you don't love what you've found
Just remember the world is round
And whatever rolls away
Can always roll back home some day
When you sleep beneath the sky
With your coat making your pillow
As the wind cries on the willows
And your bed holds no tenderness
How many days how many ways
Do I have to lose you till you're gone
How many nights how many lonely nights
Do I have to lose you till you're gone
It happens every time I think I'm getting over you
How many times how many times
Do I have to lose you till you're gone
Do I have to lose you till you're gone
I see you on the late show I hear you on the radio
Darling everywhere I go your memory is there
How many times how many times
Do I have to lose you till you're gone
They say that times are getting harder
Well that's easy to say
And this crazy world can't go much farther
It's spinning faster each day
But not everything has changed
Kids still get restless on rainy days
Lilacs still fill the air in spring
Love's still the only word that I can use in telling you
The way I feel and I'll love you always
Some things never change
Seems like we're always in a hurry getting no where fast
We're all wrapped up in work and worry but all of that will pass
It's the simple things that last
Kids still get restless on rainy days
Lilacs still fill the air in spring
Love's still the only word that I can use in telling you
The way I feel and I'll love you always
Some things never change
After all that we've been through
Aren't we the same two people
Who took those vows that mean nothing now
Didn't we sit at this table as husband and wife
Now we're on opposite sides
Is this the way love ends
It's all there in black and white
All the words that separate our lives
But love falls between the lines
It's something you can't write
Can we forget all the good times
Can we be sure that it's finished
It's all come down to this
Is there something that we missed
It's all there in black and white
All the words that separate our lives
But love falls between the lines
It's something you can't write
But opening and closing doors swing both ways
It's all there in black and white
All the words that separate our lives
But love falls between the lines
It's something you can't write
You look so good to me
But I'm not sure I can
And putting my life in to order
Don't bring me no flowers
Don't call me back in an hour
I'm not ready for somebody new
It's a little too soon
It's been too long since somebody gave a damn
And I ought to get up and grab you
But please understand
Don't treat me so gentle
Don't make me all sentimental
I'm not ready for somebody new
Cause tomorrow's another day
It's a little too soon
I said you're someone I don't wanna see
I told my friends at work it wasn't worth the hurt
But it's a different story when I go to sleep
I say I don't love you but the truth comes out at night
I can fool myself until I close my eyes
I say I don't love you but the truth comes out at night
I don't want you in my life
I cane make it sound convincing
I don't recall your number
Don't reach for you at night
Don't ask your friends about you
Why I can't forget what you've forgotten
Why my heart stays in yesterday
I found a new apartment
It's not that I've been lonely
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone away
But you'll be sorry someday
It's gone away from me
It's gone away from me
Although I'll still live on
You know so lonely I'll be
It's gone away for good
It's gone away for good
Some day I'll be over it all
Just like I know a good woman should
And now that it's all over
All I can do is wish you well
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone away
Sitting on the front porch
News comes on the radio
There's trouble all around
That's the way it always been
And the way it'll always be
I thank the good Lord I've got you
The rich keep getting richer
The poor barely get by
Farmer Johnson says it's either
Jobs are scarce down at the factory
I thank the good Lord I've got you
When it's easy to get down
You're my inspiration
You're my solid ground
Love will pull us through
We can read about the latest
In the fashion magazines
But that don't change the fact
That we got patches on our jeans
Everybody's needing money
Even the preachers preaching on TV
I thank the good Lord I've got you
When it's easy to get down
You're my inspiration
You're my solid ground
Love will pull us through
For a nickel candy bar
And a dollar's worth of gas
Won't even start your car
Here in the land of free
But there's no place I'd rather be
I thank the good Lord I've got you
He had the best of both worlds
And I bet he's proud of himself
The way he split his time
Telling all his friends
How good it feels to play both ends
I'm sure in all of their eyes
Two women one man's been lying to
Like the best of friends
But we're not to blame for the pain
When we break the news
That you know about me and I know about you
He better start to run from this
Two women one man's been lying to
When we break the news
That you know about me and I know about you
He better start to run from this
Two women one man's been lying to
I guess we see now what blind love can do
Two women one man's been lying to
It's just a year today
One year since he went away
You're one year old today
There'll be the cake tonight
One candle I'm gonna light
Old love still burns tonight
You made my heart your home
Looks like each guest is here
Life holds no fascination
Without you here with me
And friends are small consolation
Talk doesn't ease the pain
The hurt can't be explained
Only a lonely heart knows
How the memory cuts like a knife
Since you walked out of my life
I'm half crazy day and night
And only a lonely heart knows
Time is a friend and an enemy
In time the hurt might end
Till then the walls close in
I sit alone and stare
You don't know till you've been there
And only a lonely heart knows
How the memory cuts like a knife
Since you walked out of my life
I'm half crazy day and night
And only a lonely heart knows
With each breath I take I sing
Honestly I will stay that way
As long as day will follow night
Always there to hold you tight
A mountain we can't climb
You're my key to heaven's doors
Just as much as I am yours
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Here to stay is a new bird
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
But you can do the job
As we dream by the fire
Walking in a winter wonderland.
And pretend that he's a circus clown
Until the other kids knock him down.
Though your nose gets a chilling
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Little girls and little boys
Dream of worlds full of toys
This time of the year
When Christmas is near
And evergreens are snowy white
Sleigh bells ring through the night
This time of the year
When Christmas is near
And somewhere near a steeple
People kneel and pray
And choirs sing carols
Santa Claus is on his way
With loads of joy on his sleigh
This time of the year
When Christmas is near
When Christmas is near
With loads of joy on his sleigh
This time of the year
Once again the windows shine with pretty lights
Once again our loved ones gather at our sight
Busy crowds of strangers greet each other with a smile
There's Christmas in the eyes of every child
Once again the presents are resting by the tree
Once again we worship the One who came for you and me
I hear choirs of voices as they're singing out His name
Again we tell the story of how the Christ Child came
One night a year we believe in peace on earth
One night a year we praise our Saviour's birth
I wish every night the whole year through could be like Christmas Eve
Once again around the world heads are bowed in prayer
Once again the promise of peace is in the air
But soon will come the morning and the feeling will be past
And I can't help but wonder why the feeling only lasts
One night a year we believe in peace on earth
One night a year we praise our Saviour's birth
I wish every night the whole year through could be like Christmas Eve
One night a year we believe in peace on earth
One night a year we praise our Saviour's birth
I wish every night the whole year through could be like Christmas Eve
I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
I'll be home for Christmas
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
I'll be home for Christmas
The magic in the frosty air
That feeling everywhere
Or maybe just the stars so bright that shined above you
It could have been the holiday
The country side all dressed in white
That crazy snowball fight
That wrapped us up within it's spell
It only took one kiss to know
It must have been the mistletoe
The magic in the frosty air
That made me love you
The night I fell in love with you
It only took one kiss to know
The magic in the frosty air
That feeling everywhere
The magic in the frosty air
That made me love you
The magic in the frosty air
A Christmas tree with lights turned low
It's that precious time for family and friends
Old memories and mistletoe
That feeling of Christmas fills the air
May His spirit follow you throughout the year
And may this Christmas be the best from our house to yours
And may this Christmas be the best from our house to yours
Shepherds gaze in wonder
While angel voices sing
This night of nights has come
The earth is filled with gladness
And yet the heavens weep
For heaven's eyes can see
He was born to die for me
Is that a tear in your eye
You must know you were born to die
It must have broken God's heart
For the future He could see
Yet He formed His hands and feet
Knowing one day they'd be nailed to a tree
So all the world could know it
A gift came from above
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
With a tear of love in your eye
I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams
I couldn't leave her if I tried
I thought love was more or less a giving thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
When I needed sunshine I got rain
I'm in love and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams
What's the use of trying
When I wanted sunshine I got rain
I'm in love and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
It's like a nightmare
I'm ready to trade the fast lane for a country road
There's a New York skyline but there's no sunshine
Watching the stocks rise keeps them paralyzed
I'm ready to trade the fast lane for a country road
I'm gonna take a turn for the better
It's been a long hard ride
This can't go on forever
I need a Sunday drive
Let me get behind the wheel before I lose control
And trade this fast lane for a country road
There's a desert sunset I haven't seen yet
I'm gonna rise above the madness then I'll be laying low
I'm ready to trade the fast lane for a country road
I'm gonna take a turn for the better
It's been a long hard ride
This can't go on forever
I need a Sunday drive
And let me get behind the wheel before I lose control
And trade this fast lane for a country road
Do you think I'm such a fool
To believe everything
That just goes to show
That you really don't know
While you're out painting the town
Do you think I'm home
Now who's really the fool
When I first found out
Till I got to know her
And I became just like her
So don't be surprised to find
Your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil
In someone else's arms tonight
Your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil
In someone else's arms tonight
If you were tired of loving me
When love was already gone
You weren't feeling well
Did you think I couldn't tell
You've been with somebody else
You were only kidding yourself
When I first found out
Till I got to know her
And I became just like her
So don't be surprised to find
Your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil
In someone else's arms tonight
Your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil
In someone else's arms tonight
Your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil
In someone else's arms tonight
Your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil
Flannel shirts Even when they weren't in style
At the movies when the West was really wild
When all of my friends
Now look at everybody
They call us country bumpkins
I'm just glad we're in a country
Where we're all free to choose
The feelings all come back
And I still see your face
It's strange how the days turned into years
To dreams are already gone
Years of wishing you were here
After all this time you'd think I wouldn't cry
It's just that I still love you after all these years
Nighttime gently falls
I turn around to find you're still not here
I leave the hall light on
In case you come back home
But I've been saying that for years
To dreams are already gone
It's of wishing you were here
After all this time you'd think I wouldn't cry
It's just that I still love you after all these years
I took a vacation down by the ocean
But it's no fun with a heart that's broken
I see lovers walking on the beach at sunset
I wish you were here but you're with another
If I knew where you were
I'd send you a postcard
I wish you were here but you're with another
That's what we used to be
I just wish we'd ended up the way we started out
From one little room where we loved each other
To this big two story house
We wanted the best I'm afraid that's what we've got now
We're the best of strangers
No one could do it any better
We live here separately together
We're the best of strangers
We share a ceiling and a floor
But there's no feeling anymore
We're the best of strangers
We stare at different walls
And most of the time we don't even say goodnight
Except passing in the hall
And then when we do we both apologize
We're the best of strangers
No one could do it any better
We live here separately together
We're the best of strangers
We share a ceiling and a floor
But there's no feeling anymore
We're the best of strangers
We're the best of strangers
It's just a year today
One year since he went away
You're one year old today
There'll be the cake tonight
One candle I'm gonna light
Old love still burns tonight
You made my heart your home
Looks like each guest is here
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If being right means being without you
I'd rather live a wrong than right
My mama and daddy say it's a shame
It's a downright disgrace
But as long as I got you by my side
I don't care what my people say
My friends tell me there's no future
In loving a married man
If I can't see you when I want
I'll see you when I can
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
So deeply in love with you
Knowing you got a wife
And two little children
For the gentleness of your touch
Knowing you got somebody else at home
Who needs you just as much
Am I wrong to give my love
Am I wrong for trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
Am I wrong to give my love
Am I wrong for trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
I don't wanna be right
If it means sleeping without you
I don't wanna be right
If it means sleeping alone at night
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I was wrong you were right
What I really mean to say is
You can kick off all the covers in the middle of the night
You can sleep with the window open wide
Do anything as long as your by my side
You can eat crackers in my bed anytime
A double bed to myself now that you're gone
It's a matter of fact I've got to have you back
I just want you to know
You can kick off all the covers in the middle of the night
You can sleep with the window open wide
Do anything as long as your by my side
You can eat crackers in my bed anytime
You can sleep with the window open wide
Do anything as long as your by my side
You can eat crackers in my bed anytime
You can kick off all the covers in the middle of the night
You can sleep with the window open wide
Do anything as long as your by my side

Two women one man's been lying to
Sitting on the front porch
News comes on the radio
There's trouble all around
That's the way it always been
And the way it'll always be
I thank the good Lord I've got you
The rich keep getting richer
The poor barely get by

I thank the good Lord I've got you
And on Beale street they still play the blues
They still make Jack Daniels in Lynchburg
You can get the best biscuits and gravy
And Loretta can still really sing
But there's no love in Tennessee
At least not the kind I really need
But they can't help me get you back again
There's no love in Tennessee
I know it's a beautiful place to be
But without you here with me
There's no love in Tennessee
Remember up on look out mountain
Our future seemed so clear
But I still love the magic of Dixie
There's still no place better than home sweet home
There's no love in Tennessee
At least not the kind I really need
But they can't help me get you back again
There's no love in Tennessee
I know it's a beautiful place to be
But without you here with me
There's no love in Tennessee
There's no love in Tennessee
At least not the kind I really need
But they can't help me get you back again
Sometimes I really think it's over
But your blue eyes have never lost a fool
One kiss and I'm right back believing
You always find all the scattered pieces
Your words turn lies back into truth
Your love opens every door it closes
Your touch knows the fine art of healing
Your heart knows when to make it's move
You always find all the scattered pieces
Your words turn lies back into truth
Your love opens every door it closes
You've been very hard to find
I'm sure you know your payments
Are running months behind
So I'm writing just to tell you
I sure could use the money
But I've got my child support
He wakes me up each morning
And brings a little heaven
And his legs are short
At a new department store
My sister watches Billy
So he has everything he needs
I hope I help him half as much
You ought to see him smiling
When I come home from work
You could never pay me
What that look is worth
He doesn't have a lawyer
He's never been to court
But he's right on time
With his child support
He goes to bed each evening
And says a little prayer
For that little angel
I assure you I'll do you no wrong
Then I can smile again and I can show my face.
I wish that I could fall in love today
But memories of you stand in the way
And I just can't make my heart find someone new
Each night I pray I'll wake at dawn and find
Another in my heart and on my mind
Then I awake I hear my poor heart say
I wish that I could fall in love today
I wish that I could fall in love today
But if I did I know I wouldn't stay
Somehow they never measure up to you
You took your suitcase and your toothbrush
And walked out in your walking shoes
You left behind this little letter breaking me the news
But now some things of mine are missing
Some things that I could dearly use
And since the evidence points to you
I don't mean to be unfriendly
All I want is to be fair
I'll be more than glad to share
But you gotta tell me where
Are the pieces of my heart
It was bad enough to break it
After all that we've been through
But then to go on and take it
Every night I feel so empty
This pain is more than I can bear
Even if you do not care
You just gotta tell me where
Are the pieces of my heart
It's not the first time it's been broken
It's been dropped a time or two
I got to piece it together
And then get over you
Where even if you do not care
You just gotta tell me where
Are the pieces of my heart
Where even if you do not care
You just gotta tell me where
Billy had a woman but he treated her bad
Lost the best thing he ever had
Betty got tired of being put down
So she packed her bags and left this town
Gotta love somebody if you wanna them to stay
Treat them right or they'll slip away
You never stay warm at night
Stirring it up will make that flame burn higher
Falling in love will come easy for you
But staying in love us what's hard to do
A little give and take and compromise
Can help to keep your love alive
You gotta say you love him every day
Show you need him in a hundred ways
You never stay warm at night
Stirring it up will make that flame burn higher
You never stay warm at night
Stirring it up will make that flame burn higher
You never stay warm at night
Stirring it up will make that flame burn higher
So now there's somebody new
Dreams I have been dreaming
Have all fallen through
Someday that might be true
But it's too soon to tell
Oh it's too soon to say
I'll be able to wish you well
It's just too soon to tell
It's all for the best so you say
You never intended to hurt me this way
I won't drown in my tears
Well baby the best I can say
It's too soon to tell
Oh it's too soon to say
I'll be able to wish you well
It's just too soon to tell
Well at times it's been a fight
But I've tried to do what's right
Even when everything went wrong
I still believed that we would make it
You put your tiny hand in mine
And I look in your trusting eyes
Knowing that love will see us through
But if my life should end tomorrow
I know you'll be the living proof
You sweet child of mine
You've made my life worth living
And when all my earthly days are through
I'll leave here knowing I did what I came to do
And when I say goodbye I know that
I'll leave something good behind
Well at times it's been a fight
But I've tried to do what's right
Even when everything went wrong
I still believed that we would make it
It hasn't always turned out like I planned
But I've done the best I can
To help you someday face the world alone
And after I've been long forgotten
You sweet child of mine
You've made my life worth living
And when all my earthly days are through
I'll leave here knowing I did what I came to do
And when I say goodbye I know that
I'll leave something good behind
If someone had told me
That one man could hold me
And leave me weak as a baby
Love hit me like a ten pound hammer
Yeah... love hit me like a ten pound hammer
I used to play it so cool
Lord knows I was no fool
No chains would ever bind me
But those days are all behind me... ya see
Love hit me like a ten pound hammer
Yeah... love hit me like a ten pound hammer
I never saw love's power
Just the hearts and the flowers
And when I fell it was frightening
It struck me down like lightening... when
Nobody had a hold on me
All it took was a kiss from you
To bring me right down to my knees... All right
Love hit me like a ten pound hammer
Yeah... love hit me like a ten pound hammer
Love hit me like a ten pound hammer
Yeah... love hit me like a ten pound hammer
Love hit me like a ten pound hammer
Yeah... love hit me like a ten pound hammer
He fell in love with an Indian maiden over in the antique store.
He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk.
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped some day he'd talk.
Because his heart was made of knotty pine.
His heart was set on the Indian maid with the coal black hair.
If loving you is wrong...

The magic in the frosty air that feeling everywhere
It must have been the pretty lights that glistened in the silent night
It may be just the stars so bright that shined above you
Our first Christmas more than we'd be dreaming of
That we would fall in love
It could have been the steeple bell that wrapped us up in its spell
It only took one kiss to know it must have been the mistletoe
Our first Christmas more than we'd be dreaming of
Would lead to all of this
The magic in the frosty air that made me love you
On Christmas eve our wish came true that I would fall in love with you
It only took one kiss to know it must have been the mistletoe
He fell in love with an Indian maiden over in the antique store
So she could never answer yes or no
He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk
The maiden wore her beads and braids
And hoped someday he'd talk
Because his heart was made of knotty pine
His heart was set on the Indian maid with the coal black hair
So she could never answer yes or no
And then one day a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
Deeper than the oceans
Higher than the stars above
But I am from the country
And I know I ain't seen it all
But I heard that ocean's salty
But they just don't do justice
For the way I feel for you
So I had to write a song about
All the things I knew
My love is deeper than the holler
Stronger than the river
My love is purer than the snowflake
That falls in late December
On a springtime window sill
With a million miles between
There's a least a million love songs
That people love to sing
Some of them are different
Some of them the same
This is just another way
My love is deeper than the holler
Stronger than the river
My love is purer than the snowflake
That falls in late December
On a springtime window sill
My love is deeper than the holler
Stronger than the river
My love is purer than the snowflake
That falls in late December
On a springtime window sill
But it's quarter to four
To have you here in this room
But it's quarter to four
Are they worth the price
The night's sky turned brighter
They get me through one more
Broken strings and old guitars
And I'm okay with who I am
I'm the son of a better man
And I may never shine bright like the stars
I might cut a little loose on some Bobby McGee
Five and I can take on anything
I'm holding all I want right in my hands
Hold those glasses hot with me tonight
I might cut a little loose on some Bobby McGee
Five and I can take on anything
I might cut a little loose on some Bobby McGee
Five and I can take on anything
Six beers and a dream
Six beers and a dream
Six beers and a dream
Six beers and a dream
Useless to try and fight
The wave that crashed into me
Take this trip as far as we can get
Love those baby steps
Something still brings me alive with just one touch
Now I'm falling again like a little boy chasing his kite in the wind
I'll be falling again like the first time I felt you pulling me in
With the needle down and the record spinning
All it takes is just one love song
Yeah and I'm long gone
Is hold you closer than ever
Never lose our rhythm and rhyme
Now I'm falling again like a little boy chasing his kite in the wind
I'll be falling again like the first time I felt you pulling me in
I'll fall with you baby
I'll fall with you baby
And every guy has got you in his sight
What you're doing with a clown like me
Is surely one of life's little mysteries
So tonight I'll ask the stars above
You can look all you like
But this girl you see
There's just one more thing I need to know
So tonight I'll ask the stars above
She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him
Closes the door before the winter lets the cold in
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
And you ain't ever gonna change
You got a gypsy soul to blame
And he thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
And you ain't ever gonna change
You got a gypsy soul to blame
When you're in the lost and found
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
And I ain't ever gonna change
I got a gypsy soul to blame
I'm with your ghost again
But I know soon we'll be together
89 cents in the ashtray
Half empty bottle of Gatorade rolling on the floorboard
That dirty Braves cap on the dash
People got their ways of coping
I roll every window down
Every back road in this town
I leave that radio playing
And momma asked me this morning
I roll every window down
Every back road in this town
I've shook my fist and asked God why
I roll every window down
Every back road in this town
Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain
If I see you next to never
Then how can we say forever
I will be right here waiting for you
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
I took for granted all the times
That I thought would last somehow
But I can't get near you now
I will be right here waiting for you
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
I wonder how we can survive
But in the end if I'm with you
I will be right here waiting for you
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
And did I hear you say
All the folks around Brownsville say she's crazy
In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn
The prettiest woman that you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
Promised her he'd take her for his bride
And did I hear you say
And did I hear you say
There's a lot of ways of saying what I want to say to you
There's songs and poems and promises and dreams that might come true
But I won't talk of starry skies or moonlight on the ground
I'll come right out and tell you I'd just love to lay you down
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
There's so many ways your sweet love made this house into a home
You've got a way of doing little things that really turn me on
Like standing in the kitchen in your faded cotton gown
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Your auburn hair has faded and silver takes its place
You'll still be beautiful and I'll still be around
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
I keep going to the river to pray
And at most I'm sleeping all these demons away
My friends had you figured out
You tried hiding another you
But your evil was coming through
These guys sitting on a wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake
I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet the devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
I keep going to the river to pray
And at most I'm sleeping all these demons away
Each time that I think you go
I turn around and you're back again
And I let you under my skin
True love was going to hurt
True pain I don't deserve
Truth is that I never learn
I keep going to the river to pray
I keep going to the river to pray
And at most I'm sleeping all these demons away
I keep going to the river to pray
And at most I'm sleeping all these demons away
One of the best nights
Between the bottle of wine
And that look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
And we danced in the dark under September stars
And I know that I can't ever say it enough
But all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
If I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
And that red dress makes it hard to breathe
But that black dress brings me to my knees
All I need in this life is your crazy love
You're my great escape
Or dance around the fireplace
If I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Round yon virgin mother and Child
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Christ the Savior is born
Jesus the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born
Cross the red dirt through the rivers and pines
See the city lights of Little Rock shining
Or just kick back in a natural state
Catching catfish or digging for diamonds
What you find here is yours to take
Set it off like a fuse
Gonna get load and get on the road
We're gonna be here all day
Razorbacks are coming at ya
All the Razorbacks are coming at ya
All the Razorbacks are coming at ya
Gonna get load and get on the road
We're gonna be here all day
On this Razorback game day
On a Razorback game day
On this Razorback game day
Back home just in time to eat. cream and syrup on a biscuit sure is sweet
Put on my cap and right back out the door when I was a country boy
I watched my daddy work it every day.
Nothing ever tough enough to stand in his way
Now I'm a countryman everyday I take a stand
Wondered how all the work got done. I was trying to have some fun
Phone call came in from the county jail. my daddy's back again.
He wasn't calling me to make his bail. he just said don't give up on him.
All these years of dancing around the truth he'd finally come to realize.
That he hadn't been the dad I needed him to be and he was sorry for the lies.
I want him to know that he's forgiven and I'm trying hard to understand.
How do I rebuild a bridge that was never really there
How do I restore a love for a man who never cared
Where do I begin to find a place within my heart for
A stranger who tore mine apart.
It's hard to be a father through the mail. love gets lost in letters from jail
Tell me to clean up and I won't complain.
Give me a curfew and I won't say a thing
Tell me I'm wrong and I bet you'll win. ask me to open up and I'll let you in
I like gravy on my biscuits with a heap of butter beans
I don't mean to hurt you but I love my roots
I'm just not me without these boots
I'll bend over backwards for all you need
I like gravy on my biscuits with a pile of black eyed peas
You hurt me and I'll never be the same
I been round and round inside my mind in search of who's to blame
You've broken my faith in who we are
Baby I don't have the power to forget about the pain
I'm not strong enough to find shelter from the shame
Of seeing someone else's arms wrapped around the one I love
There's no mercy in this heart pierced by the damage you have done
So I'm praying for the one thing I have not grace like god
Does it haunt you leaving innocence behind
While I was waiting for a fairytale forever lost in time
I'd love to just move on but it all comes down to this
It's gonna take at least a couple of miracles at best
To find the strength to surrender and lay these demons down to rest.
She wakes up in the morning and don't need a thing
At the end of the day she's fine as can be
My temperature rises at the sound of her name
All I can do is pray for rain
She's bad to the bone every man's dream
The closer I get the more my heart gets scorched
Got a heat index of 102
With nothing but ashes trailing behind
2 hours on the lake we had nothing to show
Should I stay or should I go
Should I stay or should I go
If I stay then I'd get to see the way it would end up to be
If I go maybe I'll know. time just might show
Should I stay or should I go. should I stay or should I go
Different directions we would go
Should I stay or should I go
Maybe one day I'll get to see all my mistakes turn into good memories
Should I stay or should I go
I just talked to you on the phone and you said
You didn't care if I ever came home
It's full of yesterday's baggage and chasing after me
No matter where I turn I can smell that engine burn
But the smoke clouds up my future and the freedom doesn't last
Somebody tell me how I can turn this thing around
Cause there's a chain around my neck and the weight of this worlds on my back
Memories and regrets that set my mind off track
So many things I need to unload to give myself some peace
Staring at the stranger in the mirror. I miss the man he used to be
I can't even count the mistakes that brought me to this place
I've got to get my feet back on the ground
I wanna be the kinda guy that you call when things get tight
When the odds have got you up against the wall
I wanna be the kinda man your not ashamed to call your friend
The one you know will catch you when you fall
Only ends up places I belong
I wanna see the stars shine in the eyes of those around me
I wanna feel the sweet grace of the good lord surround me
I wanna be everything to everyone what ever they need
One day I'll grow into the man I wanna be
I wanna give a pure love one that's always strong enough
To pull my family through the toughest days
I wanna live a full life be a hero to my wife
Let her know that she's my saving grace
I wanna make my momma smile I wanna go the extra mile
To make sure that nobody feels alone
I wanna glow on the inside let the good book be my guide
Be a light house till the angel takes me home
I've left a troubled passed behind me
I'm making changes for the best
Until I top this hill I'm climbing
I meant to make you dinner but I burned the steak
So I booked a restaurant but we got there late
Extra value menu at least it was super sized
I meant to turn you on not crack you up
I wish I knew just what it took to fill your loving cup
I meant to turn you on not crack you up
I meant to light the candles when the curtains caught fire
When I tried to put it out I tripped on some speaker wire
I thought I'd make it better with a sexy dance
When I did my one two step I ripped my pants
I put my arm around you and poked you in the eye
I went in for a kiss and my bad breath made you cry
I turned down the bed and we were almost there
This ones for veterans your attention please
I can't help but notice you would have died for me
Id like to pay my respects so I'm speaking out
I know it seems sometimes people forget
The fact we're forever embraced in your debt
But I'm here to tell ya
You're what this country is about
Thank you for laying it all on the line
For going through hell so we wouldn't have to
Thank you for standing for all we believe
For holding your ground when the world was in need
Thank you for laying it all on the line
For going through hell so we wouldn't have to
Thank you for standing for all we believe
For holding your ground when the world was in need
Oh thank you for standing for all we believe
For holding your ground when the world was in need
When I think of heroes and angels
When I think of heroes and angels
Let's go moon some cars
I said let's go moon some cars
Let's go moon some cars
Let's go steal some beer
I said let's go steal some beer
Let's go set something on fire
I said let's go set something on fire
Let's go shoot some pigs
All the things they said would happen to you
You're living out all your worst possible dreams
All the times in between
I learn my lesson and I learn it again
It takes a hideous misfortune for to tell how I feel
I threw it all away like shoes into the street
These terrible things will tear me in three
I don't care what time will tell
Just tell me if I might as well be halfway to hell
I'm sick through my skin with silence and doom
I pass out cold and I go look for some more
I got all kinds of devices I'm gonna detonate
I used to work in an office in the outskirts of town
So I picked up a filing cabinet and threw it at my boss
And then I took him outside and hung him on a cross
Then I kept walking on down the road
A cigarette lighter and a live chicken
Got in all kinds of mischief
Some kinds I won't tell
I did all kinds of things
Well I went into the peekaboo hut
To watch the lady have sex with a mutt
A demolition derby with some shopping carts
I like to hijack people
I like to jump through movie screens at the best parts
I was reading that hardcore magazine
On the old black and white TV
And I painted a picture on it
And I watched it all night long
I ate a live dog and I buried his bones
Then I carved out a tombstone
A money belt in the drawer
I stole some blank checks
And I used them down at the comic book store
A sucker without a brain
Like the man on a flying trapeze
Now you're flying home
Isn't it just like a dream
Sirens and people and everything
The driver tried to swerve but he just didn't see ya
Now you're flying home
We can all climb aboard
The fare is easy to afford when you're dead
Sometimes you meet a fireman
Sometimes you meet a dancer
This is one ride where you won't need no transfer
Honey if the shoe fits you better walk on
Because you can be so careless
Always change your mind
That killjoy kind of loving they teach
I'd rather be a drip in the bathroom sink
Because you can be so careless
Always change your mind
I was all for the damage that a drunk
Cast off with that flick of the hand
I'm not sure a donkey know ya jackass
Always change your mind
Burn everything behind me
Down in the bottom of a bottle of wine
Down in the bottom of a bottle of wine
Well I might just get the urge to roll out of bed
Dishes in the sink and my body starts to itch
Together we found misery
I'm gonna catch that train and ride
Can go back from where you came
MTV makes me wanna smoke crack
MTV makes me wanna get high
Can't get a ride no matter how I try
And everyone's perky and everyone's uptight
Makes me wanna smoke crack
MTV makes me wanna get high... as the moon
Like a rubber balloon
Bust out the biscuits
Play those videos every woman and man
MTV makes me wanna get high as a kite
Aw yeah... Fake it till you make it
I work down at the video store
With a sparkle in my step
And a smile on my face
And those videos are better than love
The sun is down when I'm around
To walk the lane of wonderful pain
I live in jails and everything fails
I keep the trash and clean it for you
If it's not in the TV Guide then I don't know.
Buy buy buy a lot of junk to fill up the time.
But these are my main blues
I get these blues from you
If I could write a book
You'd burn and let it cook
If I could duck and hide
You would bite off my thigh
Of constant rejection
You don't have a cure
Your life is too secure
My life is still a blur
I didn't know what you were
But I'm happy to tell it
You probably smell it
Smoke from a burning pan
This is song two on the album
This is the album right here
Tonight the city is full of morgues
And all the toilets are overflowing
There's shopping malls coming out of the walls
As we walk out among the manure
As he's dancing upon your paycheck
The sales climb high through the garbage pail sky
Get out your ten foot flags
The insects are huge and the poison's all been used
She was living in a bad moon
The truth is naked when it's around
Like a creature under the ground
She been hiding keys to the car
Throw those pictures down the lane
She got scissors in my brain
Today I found a thousand steaming hot dogs in my bathtub
Goat's head nailed to my door
There was voices chanting in the toaster oven
And I drove to work from the back seat of my car
People are smoking joints out of their noses at their desks
And the telephones are answering themselves
And the supermarket was having a free sale
And the turkeys were climbing out of their packaging
And dancing in the aisles with friendly midgets
As watermelons exploded with delight
Santa Claus ran naked through the city with his fangs on fire
Taco truck was being driven by a hyperventilating cactus
A mariachi band was playing water polo with a prosthetic head
And the furniture was sitting on all the people
And the plates were eating all the food
Do the things you feel
Walk around with a broken leg
And a hundred dollar bill
Get yourself a pistol
Sleeping in a hollow log
Walk till you're restless
Sleep till you're tired
Wake up without thinking
What you seem to be saying
Is you're patiently waiting
Like an ashtray for the butt
When you're not picking it up
But you treat me like a clown
And I don't want to be funny
Fat chance glued to the wall
Like a centerfold of an old cannonball
But you treat me like a clown
And I don't want to be funny
I lost my job at the Hut
And the silverware's burnt
But you treat me like a clown
And I don't want to be funny
My friends were having a party
I felt something strange was starting
And it's much too late to stop
I told the coffee table that I liked her
And took her in my arms
Nobody had any clothes on
Except for the motorcycle helmets
And after the sun did rise
I was taken by surprise
I was burned out beyond belief
Had to pick myself off the floor
My mother was at the door
Selling Watchtower magazines
I couldn't believe it was true
Hey mom I thought you were a Jew
She stepped in a bowl of vomit
Wiped it on some guy's face
My ma was a Jehovah's witness
Had to buy a subscription just to make her leave
I had to pick myself off the floor
My mother was at the door
Selling Watchtower magazines
Her prayers were much too frequent
After all that shock treatment
My friend picked me up about quarter past five
We stopped and got some donuts and we took a little drive
And there's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck
There's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck or what
We spent many years always trying to get high
And there's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck
There's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck or what
Got some Molly Hatchet going on the stereo
And there's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck
There's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck
There's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck
There's a fume in this truck
Well that highway won't get you to heaven
Won't get you to heaven and it never will
Well that highway won't get you nowhere
Won't get you nowhere and it never will
Well I woke up in the cradle
Now I'm walking like a broken man
I might leave you all my troubles
And that highway won't get you to heaven
Won't get you to heaven and it never will
Well that highway won't get you nowhere
Won't get you nowhere and it never will
All your riches were turned to rubbish
When you find out what you've been
You'll find that the only place that road is going
And that highway won't get you to heaven
Won't get you to heaven and it never will
Well that highway won't get you nowhere
Won't get you nowhere and it never will
I was watching that old railroad
Now I'm hiding from this world
And that highway won't get you to heaven
Won't get you to heaven and it never will
Well that highway won't get you nowhere
Won't get you nowhere and it never will
One time I knew a pleasure so few
You were too kind to be so cruel
I remember when you were my friend
Pieces of chain cool in the rain
No money on the plate
No booze left to pour
Get yourself together
Get yourself back home
Find what you were looking for
And leave the rest alone
No ski lodge in the hills
Get yourself together
Get yourself back home
Find what you were looking for
And leave the rest alone
No pickle in the drawer
No time to run and get some more
So get yourself together
Get yourself back home
Ain't gonna help you when your coffin's late
Then duck your head down the bend
Ain't lied to the devil when he's your only friend
But your heart is black like I always knew
Throw the chicken and break the wine
Well you say it once and you say it twice
Everything is nice when you're throwing the rice
Ain't gonna help you when your coffin's late
You can hide your head around the bend
You can't lie to the devil when he's your only friend
The sun is shining today
On the things that won't go away
You're getting fat in that old Stetson hat
But you're looking good just the same
And the things I can't stand
Whiskey be your lover
Bleeding hearts be calm
The idle hands of love
You've found your thrill on top of the stand
I got the bottle in my hand
And things I can't stand
Whiskey be your lover
And the things I can't stand
Whiskey be your lover
Do the things you feel
Walk around with a broken leg
And a hundred dollar bill
Get yourself a pistol
Sleeping in a hollow log
Walk till you're restless
Sleep till you're tired
Wake up without thinking
Better to be dumb than be done
In the eyes of the Lord
Better to be dumb than be done
In the eyes of the Lord
Stupid things you do for no reason
Well you lost your mind somehow
Better to be dumb than be done
In the eyes of the Lord
Better to be dumb than be done
In the eyes of the Lord
Friends of mine died through their eyes
The misery they spread around the room
It's better to be dumb than be done
In the eyes of the Lord
Better to be dumb than be done
In the eyes of the Lord
I smoked my cigarettes and cried
And I cried through the night
The foolish way I walk upon my hands
Better to be dumb than be done
So make me breakfast while I'm waiting
Make me breakfast while I'm in the other room
Don't crack my bacon till I can't stay
I just want you to know that
Like they said in the days of old
One day your faces will grow mold
For the judgment is close at hand
When the water will take back the land
From the tallest of the tall
When every bitter soul is canned
The water will take back the land
There's a blow dryer stinging your eyes
When the alcohol is starting to rise
There's a fire hose on a marching band
When the water will take back the land
Your table where it blew into the smoke
Where gravity certainly awoke
There won't be no one left you can stand
When the water will take back the land
The graveyard is starting to fry
And the moonshiners taking to the sky
There's a stone turning to sand
I thought I heard a chainsaw
Rather late last night
Well the last thing I saw
I knew we were in trouble
I knew she lost her head
Well the last thing I saw
And put my ass in the front
Well the last thing I saw
She will put you down
See how hard you fall
You got to land on your feet
Better run from the world
That done turned the devil on you
Better run from the world
That done turned the devil on you
She's holding matches in her hand
So don't try to make the bed
Better run from the world
That done turned the devil on you
Better run from the world
That done turned the devil on you
She will blow you off
Better run from the woman
Done turned the devil on you
Better run from the one
On the plains of the Buffalo
Madam will take it slow
Your gambling days are gone
You poor misguided soul
At the last ditch you will weep
For the shadows in the garbage heap
Like a pig roasting on a spit
Your poor misguided soul
If the horse's mouth could speak
His days would turn to weeks
You'd be bored with all that you know
You poor misguided soul
When the cactus makes your bed
You'll stay awake instead
By the bones in the old campfire
Your poor misguided soul
Your one dollar up in heaven
Is worth five more in hell
With a bottle and a pistol in his coat
Don't believe the junk they put on you
They rolled Jesus Christ in a cave
And don't believe the junk they put on you
Daniel Johnston was a worried man
He knew about the devil's plan
There's ashes on the corn
For every sucker born
Don't believe the junk they put on you
Now I'm biting on the bullet hard
As I'm fending back these prison guards
There's so much I don't need
Shove that banjo up your sleeve
And don't believe the junk they put on you
The wind is biting down your neck
Though your heart is all twisted
And every word seems fake
Don't get bent out of shape
Hang up some pluck on your ribs
Leave that lonesome shack
And let the waters rise
Otherwise you're choking on your tears
Though you're sick of yourself
And it's too late to escape
Don't get bent out of shape
Cut the crap and cut the beans
Don't get bent out of shape
And every word seems fake
Don't get bent out of shape
Don't get bent out of shape
You got to go back to where you came
You got to go back to where you came
You can smoke and you can moan
And you can jump on a bone
You got to finish all your business
You got to go back to where you came
You got to go back to where you came
You can crawl and you can run
And you can fall and you're done
You got to finish all your business
You got to go back where you came
Yeah you got to go back from where you came
You can live and you can hide
But you got to finish all your business
You got to go back where you came
We thought we'd take a trip
We thought that we would go
Spend a weekend pleasant down in Mexico
I stuffed them all in a bag and I ducked down below
Well the boss got angry when he found out I didn't call the police
Concerning some jaywalking tickets
I couldn't afford to pay
So I went over to Dave's house
And got really stoned
Called up some girls but none of them were home
Well we thought we'd get some money
We thought that we might go
Spend a weekend pleasant down in Mexico
But the counter guy just laughed
And three Big Macs to go
Dave and Steve called their parents
And took the bus back home
One evening as a moonshiner laid in his room
Drinking himself to sleep
A dream came upon his eyes
It was all about a man named Will
A drinker from way back when
The liquor caused him to leave his home
And turn from all his friends
With nothing to ease the pain
But the whiskey that was sold to him
By the moonshiner every day
As he raised his final cup
And he walked out on that farewell road
He tried to make it through
The coldest sky upon his eye
The moonshiner ever knew
When the jug is in my hand
But I'm burning my still down just the same
MTV makes me wanna smoke crack
MTV makes me wanna get high
Can't get a ride no matter how I try
And everyone's perky and everyone's uptight
Makes me wanna smoke crack
MTV makes me wanna get high... as the moon
Like a rubber balloon
Bust out the biscuits
Play those videos every woman and man
MTV makes me wanna get high as a kite
Aw yeah... Fake it till you make it
I work down at the video store
With a sparkle in my step
And a smile on my face
And those videos are better than love
We thought we'd take a trip
We thought that we would go
Spend a weekend pleasant down in Mexico
I stuffed them all in a bag and I ducked down below
Well the boss got angry when he found out I didn't call the police
Concerning some jaywalking tickets
I couldn't afford to pay

And got really stoned
Called up some girls but none of them were home
Well we thought we'd get some money
We thought that we might go
Spend a weekend pleasant down in Mexico
But the counter guy just laughed
And three Big Macs to go
Dave and Steve called their parents
And took the bus back home
Some folks fall for love and romance
Some like to roll in the mud and laugh
My baby just likes to cut people in half
I got the cut in half blues
Yeah the cut in half blues
Well the last thing I saw was a big long saw
I got the cut in half blues.
Well I thought I heard a chainsaw
Revving up late one night
Woke the next morning cut in two
And I knew that I was right
I got the cut in half blues
Yeah the cut in half blues
Well the last thing I saw was a big long saw
I got the cut in half blues
I knew we were in trouble
And I knew we... she lost her head
When she started bringing all those
I got the cut in half blues
Yeah the cut in half blues
Well the last thing I saw was the big long saw

There's a fume in this truck
Do the things you feel
Walk around with a broken leg
And a hundred dollar bill
Get yourself a pistol
Wake up without thinking
The sun is down when I'm around
To walk the lane of wonderful pain
I live in jails and everything fails
I keep the trash and clean it for you
But these are my main blues
I get these blues from you
If I could write a book
You'd burn and let it cook
If I could duck and hide
You would bite off my thigh
Of constant rejection
You don't have a cure
Your life is too secure
My life is still a blur
I didn't know what you were
But I'm happy to tell it
You probably smell it
Smoke from a burning pan
Like they said in the days of old
One day your faces will grow mold
For the judgment is close at hand
When the water will take back the land
From the tallest of the tall
When every bitter soul is canned
The water will take back the land
There's a blow dryer stinging your eyes
When the alcohol is starting to rise
There's a fire hose on a marching band
When the water will take back the land
Your table where it blew into the smoke
Where gravity certainly awoke
There won't be no one left you can stand
When the water will take back the land
The graveyard is starting to fry
And the moonshiners taking to the sky
There's a stone turning to sand
Please don't take it off
Please don't take it off
Please don't take it off
So it don't get empty
From all that is lost
From all that is pure
Go till you're gone and you don't come back
Wake up in the kitchen with your pants on your head
Foot in the oven and your face in the bread
Quit your job and mowing along
Standing in a corner with a quarter in hand
Looking for a woman who ain't got no plan
Special people all the time
Special people on my mind
Special people brown and white
Special people getting all uptight
Special people kiss my soul
Special people take control
Special people lick the ground
Special people word up and down
Special people squeeze the breeze
Special people slice their knees
Special people soak up fire
Special people climbing higher
Special people create belief
Special people steal some beef
Special people don't need your plans
Special people got recycling cans
Special people got songs to sing
Special people are happening
Special people stopping fast
Special people hauling ass
Special people are so sincere
Special people got special beer
Special people flick the grease
Special people come in peace
Special people will scrimp and save
Special people will never bathe
Special people in hot pursuit
Special people got the boot
Special people sleep in moss
Special people got the sauce
Special people open wide
The wind is biting down your neck
Though your heart is all twisted
And every word seems fake
Don't get bent out of shape
Hang up some pluck on your ribs
Leave that lonesome shack
And let the waters rise
Otherwise you're choking on your tears
Though you're sick of yourself
And it's too late to escape
Don't get bent out of shape
Cut the crap and cut the beans
Don't get bent out of shape
And every word seems fake
Don't get bent out of shape
Don't get bent out of shape
She was living in a bad moon
The truth is naked when it's around
Like a creature under the ground
She been hiding keys to the car
Throw those pictures down the lane
She got scissors in my brain
Last night I was drinking up and tripping too
Hanging out in every bar on the street
And if we piss you off
All my clothes smell like shit and piss
And I like to cut myself up with broken glass
Yea we're just slobs living
And if we piss you off
Everybody hates my guts and they want to kill me
My revenge is my reality
We're just slobs living
And if we piss you off
We're just slobs living
And if we piss you off
Everybody was in awe of Satan
He never wore clothes
He just walked around with a goatee and horns coming out of his head
He had tattoos and was probably into body piercing
Way before anyone else
Satan was the snake that tempted Eve
He knew how lame Eden was
Adam and Eve were thankful and had lots of sex
Which increased the population
Finally there was too many people
So Satan invented war
That way there was more places to live and more food
So God gave them Jesus
Soon they killed Jesus
So Satan gave them rock and roll
Rock and roll became bigger than religion
Everyone wanted to be in a rock and roll band
When Robert Johnson wanted to learn how to play guitar
All he had to do was go down to the crossroads and ask Satan
He even lent Jim Morrison some beads and a pair of leather pants
Satan hung out with all the rock stars
And when they got too famous or too fat
Or their music started to suck
He helped them make the best possible career move
Then people made up stories
Giving Satan a bad name
Satan went down to the earth
And then started his own place
This place was way cooler than heaven
People could go there and party
Without worrying about their job or responsibilities
It was like a big club with no cover charge
Singing blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
Overkill supermarket pencil stealing fun
Singing blah blah blah blah
I got herpes just like you
Singing blah blah blah blah
Crack smoking donkey from outer space
Singing blah blah blah
Stuff your girlfriend in a bag
Singing blah blah blah
Teenage tongue wagging porno magazine
Singing blah blah blah
Go till you're gone and you don't come back
Wake up in the kitchen with your pants on your head
Foot in the oven and your face in the bread
Quit your job and mowing along
Standing in a corner with a quarter in hand
Looking for a woman who ain't got no plan
Like they said in the days of old
One day your faces will grow mold
For the judgment is close at hand
When the water will take back the land
From the tallest of the tall
When every bitter soul is canned
The water will take back the land
There's a blow dryer stinging your eyes
When the alcohol is starting to rise
There's a fire hose on a marching band
When the water will take back the land
Your table where it blew into the smoke
Where gravity certainly awoke
There won't be no one left you can stand
When the water will take back the land
The graveyard is starting to fry
And the moonshiners taking to the sky
There's a stone turning to sand
She will put you down
See how hard you fall
You got to land on your feet
Better run from the world
That done turned the devil on you
Better run from the world
That done turned the devil on you
She's holding matches in her hand
So don't try to make the bed
Better run from the world
That done turned the devil on you
Better run from the world
That done turned the devil on you
She will blow you off
Better run from the woman
Done turned the devil on you
Better run from the one
You got to go back to where you came
You got to go back to where you came
You can smoke and you can moan
And you can jump on a bone
You got to finish all your business
You got to go back to where you came
You got to go back to where you came
You can crawl and you can run
And you can fall and you're done
You got to finish all your business
You got to go back where you came
Yeah you got to go back from where you came
You can live and you can hide
But you got to finish all your business
You got to go back where you came
Well that highway won't get you to heaven
Won't get you to heaven and it never will
Well that highway won't get you nowhere
Won't get you nowhere and it never will
Well I woke up in the cradle
Now I'm walking like a broken man
I might leave you all my troubles
And that highway won't get you to heaven
Won't get you to heaven and it never will
Well that highway won't get you nowhere
Won't get you nowhere and it never will
All your riches were turned to rubbish
When you find out what you've been
You'll find that the only place that road is going
And that highway won't get you to heaven
Won't get you to heaven and it never will
Well that highway won't get you nowhere
Won't get you nowhere and it never will
I was watching that old railroad
Now I'm hiding from this world
And that highway won't get you to heaven
Won't get you to heaven and it never will
Well that highway won't get you nowhere
Won't get you nowhere and it never will
Ain't gonna help you when your coffin's late
Then duck your head down the bend
Ain't lied to the devil when he's your only friend
But your heart is black like I always knew
Throw the chicken and break the wine
Well you say it once and you say it twice
Everything is nice when you're throwing the rice
Ain't gonna help you when your coffin's late
You can hide your head around the bend
You can't lie to the devil when he's your only friend
Dreamed of a beautiful woman
My nose started to bleed
My hair was shedding like a dog
My wife put my name on the bowl
She put my body in the grave
Nightmares always keep me alive
I was treated like a dog in a castle
Fear is the key to boredom
Money is the key to your eyes
She's licking your face as you smile
The city is flooded with wild turkey
The cars are all useless now
Stripped on top of the river
Here is the key to my beauty
Love is the key to her eyes
Hair shedding like a dog
My face is lubricated
Molten lava fill your face with gasoline
Kegs are roasting with the wind whipping my teeth
I walked around without my teeth
I don't know where you are
By the way I am dying with my freedom
Then we picked out some fish out of the trash
And I bit off my foot and then I ran
Keep that light bulb burning
Keep that light bulb bright
Cadillac in the driveway
I ain't got all night
I ain't got all night
Cadillac in the driveway
While lying in my bed listening to my motivational tape
My attitudes are changing for the better
I feel confident about my ability
I feel confident about my career
I feel positive about my direction
Positive positive positive
And my salary is gradually increasing
I'm stimulated by informative articles
There's a place in my bureau where I keep my dry cleaning ticket
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
Dog food skulls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with a loser in the cruise control
Someone keeps saying I'm insane to complain about
A shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
The forces of evil on a bozo nightmare
The daytime crap of a folk singer slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat and body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters
Let's go moon some cars
I said let's go moon some cars
Let's go moon some cars
Let's go steal some beer
I said let's go steal some beer
Let's go set something on fire
I said let's go set something on fire
Let's go shoot some pigs
All the things they said would happen to you
You're living out all your worst possible dreams
All the times in between
I learn my lesson and I learn it again
It takes a hideous misfortune for to tell how I feel
I threw it all away like shoes into the street
These terrible things will tear me in three
I don't care what time will tell
Just tell me if I might as well be halfway to hell
I'm sick through my skin with silence and doom
I thought I heard a chainsaw
Rather late last night
Well the last thing I saw
I knew we were in trouble
I knew she lost her head
Well the last thing I saw
And put my ass in the front
Well the last thing I saw
A sucker without a brain
Like the man on a flying trapeze
Now you're flying home
Isn't it just like a dream
Sirens and people and everything
The driver tried to swerve but he just didn't see ya
Now you're flying home
We can all climb aboard
The fare is easy to afford when you're dead
Sometimes you meet a fireman
Sometimes you meet a dancer
This is one ride where you won't need no transfer
I got a room down in Hollywood
It was this rooming house
There was an old man who lived in the room next to me
We shared a bathroom in the hall
Stare at me through a crack in the door
Like a mad dog with no teeth
Spent his pension in adult bookstores
He'd leave me notes in the bathroom
Come out into the hallway
Dressed up in a greasy bathrobe
He became known as the electric old man
If it's not in the TV Guide then I don't know.
Buy buy buy a lot of junk to fill up the time.
We thought we'd take a trip
We thought that we would go
Spend a weekend pleasant down in Mexico
I stuffed them all in a bag and I ducked down below
Well the boss got angry when he found out I didn't call the police
Concerning some jaywalking tickets
I couldn't afford to pay
So I went over to Dave's house
And got really stoned
Called up some girls but none of them were home
Well we thought we'd get some money
We thought that we might go
Spend a weekend pleasant down in Mexico
But the counter guy just laughed
And three Big Macs to go
Dave and Steve called their parents
And took the bus back home
My friend picked me up about quarter past five
We stopped and got some donuts and we took a little drive
And there's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck
There's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck or what
We spent many years always trying to get high
And there's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck
There's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck or what
Got some Molly Hatchet going on the stereo
And there's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck
There's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck
There's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck
There's a fume in this truck
I must be coming back too soon
Pieces of pieces lay in a pile
Somebody's walking on my hands
Everybody knows it's true
Everything is good as long it's stays still
Coins jingle in my brain
And you been watching me through your jewelry
Sending rings around my hands
Then your fingernails are much too long
Seems like everyone's just floating away
Gotta tie myself down
Satan gave me a taco and it made me really sick
The chicken was all raw and the grease was mighty thick
The rice was all rancid and the beans were so hard
And after I was done the salsa melted off my tongue
Pieces of tortilla got stuck in my throat
And the stains on my clothes burned a hole through my coat
I was so dry and thirsty and I didn't have no cash
Turned on the water and it shot right up my nose
Some old lady came along and she thought I was a freak
So she beat me with a handbag till I could hardly speak
And I woke up on the ceiling and I couldn't find my hand
The courtroom was filled with witches and the dead
The prisoners were tied up and chained to the walls
My head was about to explode when I noticed the Marshall stacks
And I realized I was in a rock video
So I went and joined the band and I went out on tour
And I smoked a lot of heroin and I passed out in manure
And I gave it all away
So I started a solo career
And I won all the awards
And I drank all the beer
I opened up a taco stand
Just to smell the smell
I'm totally fucked up. I can barely speak. I'm totally fucked up.
With hair all down in his eyes
And the microphone all covered with flies
Climbs in the bed in his cowboy boots
Who doesn't know shit
Well she found a hound dog and she named him Dutch
She kicked the boss in the shin and unplugged the games
Who doesn't know shit
Sam got canned at the cannery
He punched out the clock that night
His knuckle was bleeding as he walked home
He was cold and he had a headache
He took out all the money out of his jeans
And he set it on fire in the kitchen sink
As his wife handed him a drink
He found a sports car with the keys
Came out with the steering wheel wrapped around his head
Well he's only a person
Who doesn't know shit
They had bingo games and the raffle
All her boyfriends wanted to be dentists
And she got old fast and never did what she wanted
Who doesn't know shit
And I want you all to be singing while I'm
Thick gold chain wrapped around your neck
Bottle of pain plate in the wedge
Discount finger with a ring all around it
And the diesel burning oil in the campfire roach
Steve had a big commotion
The street fair was an ocean
When he took three tabs of bad acid
And off his melting jaw
All the wonderful things he saw
Well he looked out on the fairground
With the spinning things spinning all around
He threw up on the heel
Of the beautiful girl who was laughing
Well there must have been some pizza
And there must have been some fries
And there must have been some tequila
And there must have been some wine
And there must have been some beer
And there must have been some bagels
You could see it all so clear
And there must have been some pickles
And there must have been some catfish
With a bongo player in the back
Eternal nothingness. I offer myself so that you might
Cast your inscrutable dear silence upon me. o monstrous
Mystery beyond the realm of human thought. let me ask
For your grace and forgiveness in the knowledge that i
He's got rings on his fingers and knives all up his sleeves
He don't care you're not ready he don't care if you're not dressed
He sets your clothes on fire and brings you to your knees
He fills up the room with fashion and disease... well
Do the things you feel
Walk around with a broken leg
And a hundred dollar bill
Get yourself a pistol
Sleeping in a hollow log
Walk till you're restless
Sleep till you're tired
Wake up without thinking
I'm totally confused by you
I'm totally confused by you
You'll never understand
I'm totally confused by you
I'm totally confused by you
Put me in the suitcase
Here's a story that I want to pass on to you
that I think is... has meant a lot to me.
it's a canceled check. You have no control over
the future because you don't know what's
In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with a loser and the cruise control
Babies in Reno with the vitamin D
Someone came in saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with a phony gas chamber
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters
I got the fucked up blues
I got the fucked up blues
Upon the camel's hump
Like a voodoo curse in an old lady's purse
I got the fucked up blues
I got the fucked up blues
I got the fucked up blues
I got the fucked up blues
I woke up on the futon
Special people all the time
Special people on my mind
Special people brown and white
Special people getting all uptight
Special people kiss my soul
Special people take control
Special people lick the ground
Special people word up and down
Special people squeeze the breeze
Special people slice their knees
Special people soak up fire
Special people climbing higher
Special people create belief
Special people steal some beef
Special people don't need your plans
Special people got recycling cans
Special people got songs to sing
Special people are happening
Special people stopping fast
Special people hauling ass
Special people are so sincere
Special people got special beer
Special people flick the grease
Special people come in peace
Special people will scrimp and save
Special people will never bathe
Special people in hot pursuit
Special people got the boot
Special people sleep in moss
Special people got the sauce
Special people open wide
Gag upon the rag as I sing a song to you
Kill my inspiration crown at the end of your station wagon
Pushing like a fishing pole
Here's a story that I want to pass on to you
that I think is... has meant a lot to me.
it's a canceled check. You have no control over
the future because you don't know what's
You got a super sound
Stuck a shiny steak on me now
You just a sucker clown
I'm just a fucker now
Say that ain't funny now
You wanna ditch me now
Crack in the kitchen now
All of the people now
If I could show you how
I think you're bogus now
Got some bad feelings on me
Telling me things I already know
I make a problem for you my friend
I'm totally fucked up. I can barely speak. I'm totally fucked up.
With hair all down in his eyes
And the microphone all covered with flies
Climbs in the bed in his cowboy boots

All her boyfriends wanted to be dentists
And she got old fast and never did what she wanted
Who doesn't know shit
My soul's been sucked dry
Emptiness surrounds me
Emptiness surrounds me
With my soul sucked dry
Emptiness surrounds me
I have so many feelings
And I know that I'm dealing
I'm dealing with all these feelings
Lord I have so many feelings
And I know that I am dealing
I'm dealing with all of these feelings
I'm feeling all of these feelings
Lord I know that I'm healing
I'm trying to feel all of my feelings
Feelings that make me feel
That there's something more to be real
Lord I'm dealing with these feelings
All of these feelings
When everything is turning
Turning into my feelings
And I know that something is feeling
But to them there was no kindness
And so I came into the world
With my hands in my jacket
I needed her life to be with mine
But never will they meet
I may travel on one leg
My breakfast will be unpaid
And the flapjacks will flap back off the ceiling onto my head
And I won't and I tell how the people
They wanna touch me with my finger
I'm totally confused by you
I'm totally confused by you
You'll never understand
I'm totally confused by you
I'm totally confused by you
Put me in the suitcase
Everything I do is to try and fuck you up
Some trauma true and I was such a spasm
The man gave me a ticket
When I tried to kick it
If you wanna phone me
Give me some sympathy
She don't wanna be my friend no more
She dug a hole in the bottom of my soul
She don't wanna be my friend no more
And my body's out of tune
She's a billion years away
Dog food on the floor
And I been like this before
And everything else is small
I'll be home with the gasoline
She don't wanna be my friend no more
She dug a hole in the bottom of my soul
It's a cold ass fashion when she stole my passion
Made an effort to get just what I deserve
Now I'm rolling in sweat
With a cold cigarette
And a taco in my jeans
On the levee she glides
She's got such hairy thighs
I got taken by surprise
It's a cold ass fashion when she stole my passion
I made an effort to get just what I deserve
I'm an alien from another sphere.
The thing I like about the earth is the range of colors.
Fantastic to mundane. Brilliant to dull.
quality of the light playing upon the... the ocean
Someone is videotaping me in my spaceship
All around a water tank
A thousand miles away from home
Just to give him a line of talk
I'll see that you don't walk.
Not a penny for to show.
And he slammed the boxcar door
They let me off in Texas
A state I dearly love
Late at night and the spirit moves me
Old man with no clothes
Tell me where the money goes
And the food don't taste the same
To know I don't need to waste no time
You can call me once a week
And I'm down to the sound of the sky turned brown
I don't think it's funny
When you shave both of my arms
That I didn't mean to say
There's no kindness in this land
Better not let my good girl catch you here
She's getting all juiced up with a bottle of plain wrap beer
Coffee clothing pasted on
Clean my gravestone when I'm gone
And you better not let my good gal catch you here
She's got a whole pile of things you don't want to hear
Hitch my horse up to the town
Got my toenails painted brown
And you better not let my good girl catch you here
She'll cut you down and put the blame on me
Just a muscle in a bag
You better not let my good girl catch you here
My pants caught on fire.
Then I got some food.
Couldn't find the fridge for a while and...
She put the lit cigarette
There's s dead hobo on the patio
And an old barbed wire on the funeral fire
Satan came down dressed like a snake
And then I realized I was out of mayonnaise
Make sure the faith in the light and make heard
To be the man's greatest wife
It's a awful great struggle in any man's life
To look in the mirror in total surprise
At the great hair on her shoulders
Today has been a fucked up day
Today has been a fucked up day
Today has been a fucked up day
Today has been a fucked up day
Today has been a fucked up day
Today has been a fucked up day
With grocery bags on their heads
Ripping out your head
Where the blood is washed off
Where the blood is washed off
What you seem to be saying
Is you're patiently waiting
Like an ashtray for the butt
When you're not picking it up
But you treat me like a clown
And I don't want to be funny
Fat chance glued to the wall
Like a centerfold of an old cannonball
But you treat me like a clown
And I don't want to be funny
I lost my job at the Hut
And the silverware's burnt
But you treat me like a clown
And I don't want to be funny
It's all really gross and all the kids were diseased.
Taco trucks were crashed.
There was sausage meat all over the...
I thought I heard a chainsaw
Rather late last night
Well the last thing I saw
I knew we were in trouble
I knew she lost her head
Well the last thing I saw
And put my ass in the front
Well the last thing I saw
The demons just came through the window
Using the point of forever
There's mascara bleeding out of your eyes
The microphone is in flames
And there's a giant chicken claw above your head
there was a dead wild cat and a bottle of beer that had been... that had never opened
Satan gave me a taco and it made me really sick
The chicken was all raw and the grease was mighty thick
The rice was all rancid and the beans were so hard
And after I was done the salsa melted off my tongue
Pieces of tortilla got stuck in my throat
And the stains on my clothes burned a hole through my coat
I was so dry and thirsty and I didn't have no cash
Turned on the water and it shot right up my nose
Some old lady came along and she thought I was a freak
So she beat me with a handbag till I could hardly speak
And I woke up on the ceiling and I couldn't find my hand
The courtroom was filled with witches and the dead
The prisoners were tied up and chained to the walls
My head was about to explode when I noticed the Marshall stacks
And I realized I was in a rock video
So I went and joined the band and I went out on tour
And I smoked a lot of heroin and I passed out in manure
And I gave it all away
So I started a solo career
And I won all the awards
And I drank all the beer
I opened up a taco stand
Just to smell the smell
I'm really bored and there was some dead animals that we played with.
A cop car was on fire.
And his nose was covered with blood...
The security helicopter shot a spotlight...
I got a room down in Hollywood
It was this rooming house
There was an old man who lived in the room next to me
We shared a bathroom in the hall
Stare at me through a crack in the door
Like a mad dog with no teeth
Spent his pension in adult bookstores
He'd leave me notes in the bathroom
Come out into the hallway
Dressed up in a greasy bathrobe
He became known as the electric old man
My mind it got a dent
I couldn't make my rent
Well we eat about fifteen times a day
And I play with the fire in the stove
When my eyes peel out and my fingertips get cold
Well it's real and it's fake
The meatloaf in my chest
I failed with the best
And I stomped and I stormed
And I passed out in your dorm
Then you hustled me outside
I couldn't catch a ride
But the subway trains speak to me now
I'm browsing through the supermarket town
And the girls don't talk when I'm around
I'm totally confused by you
I'm totally confused by you
You'll never understand
I'm totally confused by you
I'm totally confused by you
Put me in the suitcase
Lightning burned the fields
We huddled in the kitchen
Sand poured through the walls
We looked to one another
The children shut their mouths
The whirling and the curving
Of destruction filled our house
Clamored all about us
From the floor like a demon
That buckled through our minds
And the dust did settle down
Lay dead on the ground
But the grit was in our food
And everywhere around us
Starvation broke on through
At the plentiful disaster
But death was in his heart
Chickens in the house
Cholesterol on your mouth
Snowman all in flames
Telling me what's real
Black Sabbath playing
I wake up in my socks
Feel like a piece of shit
Feel like a piece of shit
Feel like a piece of shit
Feel like a piece of shit
Give me something to eat
Who got no place to be
You call me up on Tuesday
I'll be stuck on Sunday night
To make me feel alright
When I snap my fingers
It's just to small to care
I don't want no lonesome life
Feel like a piece of shit
Feel like a piece of shit
Feel like a piece of shit
Feel like a piece of shit
Feel like a piece of shit
Feel like a piece of shit
Feel like a piece of shit
Feel like a piece of shit
A sparkle in the night
Tainted by the affliction
Feel like a piece of shit
Feel like a piece of shit
In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with a loser and the cruise control
Babies in Reno with the vitamin D
Someone came in saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with a phony gas chamber
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters
This is song two on the album
This is the album right here
Tonight the city is full of morgues
And all the toilets are overflowing
There's shopping malls coming out of the walls
As we walk out among the manure
As he's dancing upon your paycheck
The sales climb high through the garbage pail sky
Get out your ten foot flags
The insects are huge and the poison's all been used
I ain't got no inclination
To give away my sweet sensation
Found myself in New Orleans
With a scarecrow in my jeans
Feed my forehead through the ceiling
When you want to be with me then we will see who's fucking with my head
The devil's got your pantyhose on your head
Well you turn my body into a crutch
When you want to be with me then we will see who's fucking with my head
Make me feel like an asshole
I was born in this hotel
Washing dishes in the sink
Magazines and free soda
Trying hard not to think
Lay it on to the dawn
Everything we done is wrong
I'll be lonesome when I'm gone
Lay it on to the dawn
She can talk to squirrels
Coming back from the convalescent home
Staring at sports cars
Rattlesnake on the ceiling
Gun powder on my sleeve
I will live here forever
With the ocean and the bees
Lay it on to the dawn
Everything we done is wrong
I'll be lonesome when I'm gone
Lay it on to the dawn
Lay it on to the dawn
Lay it on to the dawn
I got a job making money for the man
Throwing chicken in the bucket with the soda pop can
Puke green uniform on my back
I had to set it on fire in a vat of chicken fat
I leaped on the counter like a bird with no hair
running through the mini mall in my underwear
I got lost downtown couldn't find a ride home
Sun went down I got frozen to the bone
Till a hooker let me share her fake fur coat
As I took a little nap the cops picked up us both
I tried to explain I was only trying to get warm
I knew I never ever should have burnt my uniform
I didn't have no teeth so I stole his gun
And I crawled out the window with my shadow on a spoon
Standing right here with a beer in my hand
And my mouth is full of sand and I don't understand
Fourteen days I been sleeping in a barn
Better get a paycheck tattooed on my arm
With the barbecue sauce and the dental floss chill
Big fat fingers pointing into my face
Telling me to get busy cleaning up this place
I got bent like a wet cigarette
And she's coming after me with a butterfly net
Black cat wrapped in the road map to hell
Pencil on my leg and I'm trying not to beg
So give me what I got to get so I can go
Acid casualty with a repossessed car
Grizzly bear motherfucker
In a pool of yellow sweat
Bring it down one more time
Touch me on the inside
With a finger full of gravy
Wanna shake and bake me
Gonna break my face on the sweet sunshine
Gonna break my face on the sweet sunshine
I wanna get up off the floor
I wanna run to the devil and get me some more
I wanna get up off the floor
I wanna run to the devil and get me some more
With a hog's head screaming
And a body always screaming
I wanna climb up on the wall
I wanna climb up on the wall
Of the plentiful sensation
Cosmic time and full of sound
And I killed my imagination
Gonna break my face on the sweet sunshine
Gonna break my face on the sweet sunshine
I wanna get up off the floor
I wanna run to the devil and get me some more
I wanna get up off the floor
I got plans to ditch myself and get outside
Dancing women throwing plates
Decapitating their laughing dates
Swirling chickens caught in flight
Out of focus and much too bright
Game show suckers trying to breathe
But I got a drug and I got the bug
And I got something better than love
I quit my job blowing leaves
Telephone bills up my sleeves
Grabbed me a beer out of the sack
Everybody bent over twice
Leaping up into the air getting juiced up beyond belief
Burnt my soul between the bun
Scraping off the attitude
Old man eating all my food
Burnt my soul between the bun
Scraping off the attitude
Old man eating all my food
Somebody put a flamethrower on that
Take me down to the depot
Somebody put me down on the bus
Put me in a hole in the ground with the money and the town
And the women all running around
Now she's longing for the pines
Watch my troubles all unwind drinking gasoline and wine
Catch a chill off the stove
Now she steals my body home
And the ground is much too clean
Ring the moon like a broken bell
When she drags you from the hill daddy's gonna burn down there still
We can watch it from the rooftop
With a fiddle on the fire
I took a leap into the fog sleeping on a hollow log
Now I'm coughing with no mouth
You can keep yourself inside but you know you cannot hide
She took me off my guard with disappointment
I got sucked inside of her apartment
A beaded necklace and a bottle of gin
She's got marijuana on the bathroom tile
Uptight and a little bit snooty
She's a rainbow choking the breeze
She's a melted avocado on the shelf
She's the science of herself
And she's meditating with the devil
She's cooking salad for breakfast
She's got tofu the size of Texas
She's a witness to her own glory
She's a frolicking depression
She's got a thousand lonely husbands
She's playing footsie in another dimension
She's a goddess milking her time
Everything I do is to try and fuck you up
Some trauma true and I was such a spasm
I got plans to ditch myself and get outside
Dancing women throwing plates
Decapitating their laughing dates
Swirling chickens caught in flight
Out of focus and much too bright
Game show suckers trying to breathe
But I got a drug and I got the bug
And I got something better than love
I quit my job blowing leaves
Telephone bills up my sleeves
Grabbed me a beer out of the sack
Everybody bent over twice
Leaping up into the air getting juiced up beyond belief
Burnt my soul between the bun
Scraping off the attitude
Old man eating all my food
Burnt my soul between the bun
Scraping off the attitude
Old man eating all my food
Somebody put a flamethrower on that
Take me down to the depot
Somebody put me down on the bus
Tonight the city is turned off
Keeping the friendship in massive supply
Give the finger to the folksinger
I'm sure he'll appreciate it deeply
You really said it when you said I was just a scavenger
Rip the plug right out of the wall
Find yourself in a pickup truck
Wasting any slime who tries to step
It's just a little grudge
It's just a little grudge
Floating through the ghetto like guillotine
The second guessing sleaze
It's just a little grudge
It's just a little grudge
The haunches of the pigs
The uniformed legions will conspire
The point is now to kill
Grind the whining bastards in their tracks
It's just a little grudge
It's just a little grudge
The people don't hate me
When something strange happens to you
Tell your parents and your teacher
When something strange happens to you
Tell your parents and your teacher
That something strange happens to you
Tell your parents on your teacher
Tell your parents and your teacher
When something strange happens to you
In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with a loser and the cruise control
Babies in Reno with the vitamin D
Someone came in saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with a phony gas chamber
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters
He's a mighty good leader
He's a mighty good leader
He's a mighty good leader
He's a mighty good leader
He's a mighty good leader
He's a mighty good leader
He's a mighty good leader
He's a mighty good leader
Lay the orange juice on the floor
We're having a picnic on the other side of town
There's sleeping bags and fire
And it's getting down to the wire
So grab yourself a spot and settle down awhile
And my clothes are starting to shrink
And the moon is sagging down like a metal ball
And the world is a holiday
They just blow it out their nose and say okay
So let's try to make it last
The past is still the past
Well there ain't nobody left to impress
And everyone's kissing their own hands
This 666 on the kitchen floor
Ain't no fire in the pan
Stiff as a stick on a board
I get thoughts and dirty socks
Getting fat on your own fear
Bring that beer over here
Long ago things to be
I've got time on my hands
I've got time on my hands
Nobody cares what I do
Long ago things to do
I've got a burnt orange peel and a potato stew
I've got work to get done
I've got work to get done
Nobody knows where to run
I've got a quart of milk and some sound advice
I've got trees to drink but they smell so nice
Don't give me the flu
Nobody knows I'm with you
Back and forth I dodge a fly
Like a feather in the sky
Give me all your cash
This is the wrong place to be
There's blood on the futon
They got people to meet
When they ask you for credit
When they want you to get it
There's nothing to tell you
There's nothing to sell you
I got a funny feeling
They got plastic in the after life
When they want you to cry
When they suck your mind
Like a pigeon you'll fly
Close your eyes and see water
Sliding up the back of your head
Folding into your clothing
No one's gonna miss you
Dried up on the shoreline
Drinking everything you said
Offering food to the ladies
Pulling down animals in trees
Yellow cat laying flat on the road
Been so long since I been gone
Do the things you feel
Walk around with a broken leg
And a hundred dollar bill
Get yourself a pistol
Sleeping in a hollow log
Walk till you're restless
Sleep till you're tired
Wake up without thinking
Stand outside with a suitcase
Walk around all the while
Look at the people driving backwards
Don't let it get near you
Don't let it get too close
Don't let it turn you into
The things you hate the most
Pull out your buckskin gloves
Tell them anything you want to
The sound comes from above
Don't let it get near you
Don't let it get too close
Don't let it turn you into
The things you hate the most
Don't let it get near you
Don't let it get too close
Don't let it turn you into
The things you hate the most
And it stands just where I sit
And the stance I took on that
And it stands just where I sit
And the stance I took on that
Bend your body to the heavens above
Just bring your money next Saturday night
Forty miles on a cattle trail
All my life I've been talking fast
Taking all the things that I should have let pass
Throw my hat on a coffin nail
Put another brick in the fire place
Well I don't know about you or me
Your brains went black when she took back her love
And she put it out into the sun
The birds did fly when the heavens all went dry
And the cigarettes were smoking by themselves
To make you feel like an asshole
Question marks stretched across her skin
To be the fool you know you are
From these shores where we belong
I have seen the land beyond
Where the Lord is strange and strong
I have seen the land beyond
There's no telling who'll be dead
When the pale horse is turning red
And the tongues will burn in vain
And everything will feel the same
I have seen the land beyond
Where the gravestones never cease
I have seen the land beyond
Through the troubles of the years
And we're haunted by our own minds
When the spirit comes in disguise
From these shore where we belong
I have seen the land beyond
I'll be there and I'll be gone
Seventeen years in the city
Static clinging to the ceiling
Never did I think it would come to this
Never did I think it would come to this
Eyebrows painted on their heads
Mouthful of rotting cavities
Never did I think it would come to this
Never did I think it would come to this
The drums aren't beating
You're just the girl of my dreams
But it seems my dreams never come true
You're just the girl of my dreams
But it seems my dreams never come true
I first met you down on Lover's Lane
You're just the girl of my dreams
But it seems my dreams never come true
You're just the girl of my dreams
But it seems my dreams never come true
You're just the girl of my dreams
Upon your painted eyelids
The world is your oyster
The ceiling is invisible
And every hour that passes
Is teaching me how to cry
In the ugly part of town
The buildings are all vacant
And the telephones are down
Like a tiger with no skin
The sewer drain is glowing
And I don't know what state I'm in
There's chemicals and debris
And all the roads are blocked off
So cancel my appointments
And set up a whole new show
And a life to call my own
So give me a plate of money
And get me a blanket and a chair
Your limitations are limitless
They're floating through the air
The things I see in you
And there's nothing I wouldn't talk about
You can't get from there to here
You can't get from here to there
You can't get from there to here
You can't get from here to there
There hasn't been a change in the atmosphere
There hasn't been a change for over a year
There hasn't been a change in the atmosphere
There's no atmosphere
Dig a tunnel through the mountain
How many atmospheres are out there
To the atmospheres are out there
There's a broken bottle
Cut your hand on the atmosphere
It's all in your mind
And it's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
Well I cannot believe
You got a devil up your sleeve
And he's talking to me
Well you're all scared and stiff
And the people you're with
They're all scared and stiff
No one knows a better mother
She's the guy who kills the sky
Burns the night out when she goes away
She's the boat in the sewer
She's the old man with manure
Rocking all night like a drum
Going back where she comes from
Big guitars on the wall
Styrofoam in her hair
She is barely anywhere
Put those sunglasses on your hips
Pass me a bag of potato chips
When I wanna put my money on a monkey
Give me a cold sore when you're young
Get old fast when you sag in the sun
Put a coffin lid on everyone
So you can be depressed
Your body on the mattress
She's got braids and broken arms
Talking at me like car alarms
When all the cars got stolen
Take me out to dinner
Take me out to dinner
The bones of our elders were lying in the street
Somehow I will feel more free
Cussed and moaned and burned the bone when I had the time
Somehow I will feel more free
And it's written in the pages to do just what they should
They stood the test and burned the rest and tore them limb from limb
Somehow I will feel more free
She is a teenage wastebasket
Paddling up the river in a casket
Trying to experience everything at least once
Life is a commercial for being fucked up
I know she's not saying much
She's walking backwards and into the dust
Her mother is proud to be dead
She's got lipstick scrawled across her forehead
She found the thrill on top of the hill
Now she's choking on the punk rock pill
To a casually pathetic future
The sun is down when I'm around
To walk the lane of wonderful pain
I live in jails and everything fails
I keep the trash and clean it for you
Throw out your clothes
The smell is disgusting
The ones that aren't there
Tear up all my things
Thick as a stick and burning crap
Running all down in the burning crap
Grow up frozen and piss on the door
Grow up frozen and piss on the door
Can't get enough of tomorrow today
Can't get enough of tomorrow today
Can't get your stick in the burning crap
Grow up frozen and piss on the door
It was back in the old days
In the time of my grief
When the ladies all disowned me
And my lungs could scarcely breathe
And the wildlife was growing wilder by the day
And I stuck to myself mostly
There was a band of brothers
They put a hand upon me
And hung me upside down
And emptied out my pockets
And kicked me on the ground
They took out the hot poker
And branded on my chest
Pelted me with stones
That felt like certain death
They went on to my lady
And made her kneel low
Tore all her hair loose
And cut through her clothes
Laughed and they hollered
And they painted the horses orange
Put the kids together
And tied them to the porch
Then blaze upon blaze
With rifles and sticks
Did they pound on the ground
I rambled and I tumbled
And I fell to my feet
He's your slime and he's out to break me
I can feel him in the distance
I have grown to see that you are better than yourself
You're more real than you pretend to be
He will burn in every way
He will taste the hell I bring
Bust a move with what you can
Dead phone machine piled on the table
Disappointment is a feather in your cap
There's no map that can tell you where you are
You're in between things that only go half way
There's s dead hobo on the patio
And an old barbed wire on the funeral fire
Satan came down dressed like a snake
And then I realized I was out of mayonnaise
She is a teenage wastebasket
Paddling up the river in a casket
Trying to experience everything at least once
Life is a commercial for being fucked up
I know she's not saying much
She's walking backwards and into the dust
Her mother is proud to be dead
She's got lipstick scrawled across her forehead
She found the thrill on top of the hill
Now she's choking on the punk rock pill
To a casually pathetic future
Well there ain't nobody left to impress
And everyone's kissing their own hands
This 666 on the kitchen floor
Ain't no fire in the pan
Stiff as a stick on a board
I get thoughts and dirty socks
Getting fat on your own fear
Bring that beer over here
And everywhere I look there's a dead end waiting
Temperature's dropping at the rotten oasis
Heads are hanging from the garbage man trees
Pistols are pointing at a poor man's pockets
Smiling eyes whipping out of their sockets
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Love machines on the sympathy crutches
Discount orgies on the dropout buses
Hitching a ride with the bleeding noses
Coming to town with the briefcase blues
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
It takes a backwash man to sing a backwashed song
Like a frying pan when the fire's gone
Driving my pig while the band's taking pictures in the grass
And my radio's smashed
And I like pianos in the evening sun
Saturday night in the captain's clothes
Tender horns blowing when my jewelry froze
My Cadillac pants going much too fast
Karaoke weekend at the suicide shack
I been spreading disease all across the land
Wishing I was living like a hit man
Face down in the guarantees
Jaundiced honchos getting busy with ease
Sawdust songs of the plaid bartenders
Western Unions of the country westerns
Silver foxes looking for romance
And you got the hot wax residues
You never lose in your razor blade shoes
Stealing pesos out of my brain
Hazard signs down the Alamo lanes
Radar systems piercing the souls
You never get caught with the wax so rotten
All my days I got the grizzly words
Hijacked flavors that I'm flipping like birds
I am the enchanting wizard of Rhythm
You only got one finger left
And it's pointing at the door
And you're taking for granted
What the lords laid on the floor
So I'm picking up the pieces
And I'm putting them up for sale
Throw your meal ticket out the window
Put your skeletons in jail
Your senses are gone so don't you hesitate
To give yourself a call
Let your bottom dollars fall
Throwing your two bit cares down the drain
Invite me to the seven seas
Like some seasick man
You'll do whatever you please
And I'll do whatever I can
Titanic fare thee well
My eyes are turning pink
Don't call us when the new age
Gets old enough to drink
Your senses are gone so don't you hesitate
To move on up the hill
Where there's nothing dead left to kill
Throwing your two bit cares down the drain
Going back to Houston
Going back to Houston
She's got a cigarette on each arm
She's got a carburetor tied to the moon
Pink eyes looking to the fruit of the ages
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's got a hand on a wheel of pain
She can talk to the mangling strangers
She can sleep in a fiery ball
Throw her troubles to the dying embers
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's got a paradise camouflage
Riding low in the drunken rivers
She's alone in the new pollution
I dropped my anchor in the dead of night
I packed my suitcase and threw it away
I fell asleep in the funeral fire
I gave my clothes to the police man
Blow back derelict wind
Lay my soul in the foul of the air
Blow back derelict wind
Lay my soul in the foul of the air
Hijackers tie the heavens down
I put my eyes in a paper bag
I'm spinning round like a gambling wheel
Blow back derelict wind
Lay my soul in the foul of the air
Blow back derelict wind
Lay my soul in the foul of the air
I dropped my anchor in the dead of night
I packed my suitcase and threw it away
I fell asleep in the funeral fire
I gave my clothes to the police man
Blow back derelict wind
Lay my soul in the foul of the air
Blow back derelict wind
Detonate with the suicide gate
Test tube stillborn days
Telescope rays in the rabies haze
Step aside for the operation
Full spectrum generation
Cyanide ride down the turnpike
Pigs and robots riding on their heels
Plowing through a road block
I been drifting along in the same stale old shoes
Loose ends tying a noose in the back of my mind
If you thought that you were making your way
To where the puzzles and pagans lay
When I wake up someone will sweep up my lazy bones
And we will rise in the cool of the evening
I remember the way that you smiled
When the gravity shackles were wild
And something is vacant when I think it's all beginning
I been drifting along in the same stale old shoes
Loose ends tying the noose in the back of my mind
If you thought that you were making your way
To where the puzzles and pagans lay
There's a destination a little up the road
From the habitations and the towns we know
A place we saw the lights turn low
Pulling out jives and jamboree handouts
Two turntables and a microphone
Bottles and cans and just clap your hands
And just clap your hands
I got two turntables and a microphone
I got two turntables and a microphone
I got two turntables and a microphone
I got two turntables and a microphone
Take me home with my elevator bones
That was a good drum break
Pick yourself up off the side of the road
Move through the room like ambulance drivers
Shine your shoes with your microphone blues
Let the man Gary Wilson rock the most
I got two turntables and a microphone
I got two turntables and a microphone
Let's make it out baby
Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone
We're all part of the total syndrome
I got two turntables and a microphone
I got two turntables and a microphone
There's a destination a little up the road
From the habitations and the towns we know
A place we saw the lights turn low
Pulling out jives and jamboree handouts
Two turntables and a microphone
Bottles and cans and just clap your hands
And just clap your hands
I got two turntables and a microphone
I got two turntables and a microphone
I got plastic on my mind
Telephone plastic baby
The last survivor of a boiled crown
Another casualty with the casual frown
The janitor vandals they bark in your face
Juveniles with the piles and paste
In the garbage grasses
With the crutches and forks
Don't be confused when your fuse is up
And you're taking a leak into your brother's cup
When the cup is filled you can run or be killed
In the billion miles of the muscles that build
The scalps of zero hailing the call
Rubbing in the blindness of them all
With the canker sores and the robot pills
Throwing imbeciles on the window sills
In the garbage classes
With the crutches of force
I don't need no wheels
I don't need no gasoline
Is blowing like a smoke machine
That I was looking for a place to get to
And my pants ain't getting no bigger
I got a stolen wife and a rhinestone life
I'm writing my will on a three dollar bill
Tell me something is getting together
I got a beard that would disappear
If I'm dressed in leather
Now let me tell you about my baby
She was born in Arizona
Trying to learn some good manners
I got a stolen wife and a rhinestone life
I'm writing my will on a three dollar bill
When I'm riding my bike to the depot
At the recreation center
If I could only find a nickel
I would pay myself off tonight
When the good times have passed out cold
I got a stolen wife and a rhinestone life
I'm writing my will on a three dollar bill
I got a stolen wife and a rhinestone life
I'm writing my will on a three dollar bill
If you're looking for somebody to cry on
An open road where I can breathe
Where the lowest low is calling to me
I can pull myself back up back down
And nobody knows where we been
Watches tick out of tune
And my bags are waiting in the next life
Rubbish piles fresh and plain
Empty boxes in a pawn shop brain
License plates stowaway
And my bags are waiting in the next life
An open road where I can breathe
Where the lowest low is coming to me
I can pull myself back up back down
When I arrive like a high five
All my days with my wheelchair ways
Watch me glide in my suicide high
I don't mean to cause a holy commotion
When I step to the room with a powerful motion
Round and round with the speed of sound
Put that gadget in the random mode
In my coat sweating like a dog
Your blind eyes are gone
Your old bones are on their own
So take off your coat
Put a song in your throat
We don't have to talk at all
The bargains you drag
And all your belongings
Your trains in the sand
Let the rats watch the races
Till we find our one and all
Your trick face is bent
You're shooting yourself
You leave yourself behind
Till we find our one and all
Ease yourself on down
And if you're bound and frowned
You better put it on down
Leaving dollar bills on the buffalo hills
The moon's eye is frozen shut
Shredded up and sold for seed
Another tribute sent to a backwards breed
Hear those buzzards flap their heaps
Up above where skies are cheap
For pioneers with chandeliers
Darkened arks in diamond ears
Through those rusty windows
Traffics shoot like venom
Causing us to fly like sticks
Fumes of flags and endless wicks
I search and strip my stale grails
And when it's time to strike the blues
This pollution is electrocution
My wagon limps a miser's pace
On borrowed fuels of lice and lace
Hail to the mother man
Can't stand the soul can
Sold my gold and left this land
Alkaline batteries shot
In the hangman's knot
Had a wooden nickel finger pointing from all sides
I shook my spice last Sunday like a broken machine
I put my hands in the air like a hazard light
With my gold chains swinging
With my gold chains swinging
With my gold chains swinging
I got birds of life and a chain gang bell
Feast and famines all holding their hands
Filling in the blanks with swollen glands
With my gold chains swinging
With my gold chains swinging
With my gold chains swinging
Had a wooden nickel finger pointing from all sides
I shook my spice last Sunday like a broken machine
I put my hands in the air like a hazard light
I'm going back home with my gold chains swinging
I'm going back home with my gold chains swinging
And everywhere I look there's a dead end waiting
Temperature's dropping at the rotten oasis
Heads are hanging from the garbage man trees
Pistols are pointing at a poor man's pockets
Smiling eyes whipping out of their sockets
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Love machines on the sympathy crutches
Discount orgies on the dropout buses
Hitching a ride with the bleeding noses
Coming to town with the briefcase blues
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind

Here's a story that I want to pass on to you
that I think is... has meant a lot to me.
it's a canceled check. You have no control over
the future because you don't know what's
I dream of silver spoon
I bought a plastic light
My separate silver wing
My suit into this cloak
My golden book she smokes
My ancient plays unfold
But she will never hope
My triple roses burst
My serpent has a curse
My serpent has a curse
My serpent has a curse
My barely modest choice
My pricks and belly wounds
My new pollution clothes
I never spot the blood
My foolish captain heard
My temple house is bust
She's got a cigarette on each arm
She's got a carburetor tied to the moon
Pink eyes looking to the fruit of the ages
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's got a hand on a wheel of pain
She can talk to the mangling strangers
She can sleep in a fiery ball
Throw her troubles to the dying embers
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's got a paradise camouflage
Riding low in the drunken rivers
She's alone in the new pollution
Kiss the girl slay a hag
Feel the flavor freedom fag
Chase the murder with the rancid pores
The thyroids with friendly blade
The haunted beast with faces flayed
Silver chicken make a fuss
Reveling in molten puss
Favorite patrons crack their death
With arteries and tinsel breath
Revolution purple fist
Pummeling your angel piss
Sour powered wussy soul
Solid darkness goddess show
Weaving heirlooms through the hour
From the cradle monster cowered
Waking up delicious ghost
They'll eat themselves from coast to coast
Dancing in their bandages
The victims grow leaving messages
Hear the commune cocaine blast
Earthly mothers with flattened chests
Fried vibrations overpowered
In the mangles of their hair
Shrouded spirits and underwear
Crazy wires fuse their brains
Drinking water sugar cane
Playing drums and broken flutes
Homeless gods and iron boots
Flying wicked love control
Circus storm and demon skull
Entering the solar sphere
Planets meld crystal clear
Thrashing in the astral glow
Flashing in their fleshly show
Waking up delicious ghost
They'll eat themselves from coast to coast
Dancing in their bandages
And everywhere I look there's a dead end waiting
Temperatures dropping at the rotten oasis
And everywhere I look there's a dead end waiting
Temperatures dropping at the rotten oasis
Got a devils haircut in my mind
Got a devils haircut in my mind
Got a devils haircut in my mind
Got a devils haircut in my mind
Got a devils haircut in my mind
Got a devils haircut in my mind
Love machines on the sympathy crutches

Let's don't be like everyone else
Convalescents open their presents
Beggars and lightweights harness the highways
Let's don't be like everyone else
Sun stroke rivals recycling bibles
Let's don't be like everyone else
You're so alone today
You gambled your soul away
Measuring your dreams of this life seems
Like the gristle of loneliness
Sipping the golden drinks
Death never hands recycled cans
And get well cars to the hostage vans
Sunk in the midnight shade
Learning to counterfeit their disease
In this town where we roam
We bluff our souls on canteen patios
Offices and fountains they named for you
Hairy fairies spinning the golden looms
Wake up the ghosts and lepers
Aching in their slavery smoke
Delinquent hygienes atrocious
We'll shoot out the great white crescent
We'll shoot out the great white crescent
Fisticuffs and zithers of Zanzibar
Body pills and shiver and caviar
Choice cut meats of derelict boulevards
Wake up the ghosts and lepers
Aching up their slavery smoke
Delinquent hygienes atrocious
We'll shoot out the great white crescent
We'll shoot out the great white crescent
Wake up the ghosts and lepers
Aching in their slavery smoke
Delinquent hygienes atrocious
We'll shoot out the great white crescent
Tell me where you want me to go
If I'm gone then I'll get there soon
Tell me where you want me to be
If I've been there split in two
Tell me what you want me to say
Then I'll put my tongue away
Tell me what you want me to see
With my eyes so grizzly gray
Tell me where you want me to go
If I'm gone then I'll get there soon
Tell me what you want me to be
If I've been there split in two
I lay upon the gravel
Pulls me one way or the other
In the evacuated heavens
Treated you like a rusty blade
A throwaway from an open grave
Cut you loose from a chain gang and let you go
And on the day you said it's true
Tried to tell you I never knew it could be so sweet
Blame the devil for the things you do
It's such a selfish way to lose
The way you lose these wasted blues
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
When the moon is a counterfeit
Better find the one that fits
Better find the one that lights the way for you
When the road is full of nails
Garbage pails and darkened jails
And their tongues are full of heartless tales that drain on you
You fade into a shaded room
It's such a selfish way to lose
The way you lose these wasted blues
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Lazy flies all hovering above
And he looks to the clouds
All pink and disheveled
There must be some blueprint
Some creed of the devil
Inscribed in our minds
Who wants to be there
To harness dead horses
A life of confessions
The trawlers drift by
They're chewing dried meat
In a house of disrepute
And syphilis patients
On brochure vacations
That traps you like searchlights
Vibrates with pleasure
Carouse in the parlor
To harness dead horses
A life of confessions
But you're a pain in the neck
I thought you knew this
You're handing me a canceled check
Your girlfriends think you're a saint
I'll give you a quarter
And I get caught up in the moonlight
Reaching out for a rotten egg
It's crystal clear your time is nearly gone
And do the things that you should
Have never had it so good
The kids are making a racket
The wild lives are so mild
And I get caught up in the moonlight
Reaching out for a rotten egg
It's crystal clear your time is nearly gone
And I get caught up in the moonlight
Reaching out for a rotten egg
These withered hands have dug for a dream
Sifted through sand and leftover nightmares
Turns shit to gold and blows my soul crazy
O I grow weary of the end
O hungry days in the footsteps of fools
Stink like colognes from the newfangled wasteland
O I grow weary of the end
Where the castaways look so deranged
When will children learn to let their wildernesses burn
These withered hands have dug for a dream
Sifted through sand and leftover nightmares
they reek of tropical charms
the embassies lie in hideous shards
Where tourists snore and decay
When they dance in a reptile blaze
Where there's no more confetti to throw
You wouldn't know what to say to yourself
Love is a poverty you couldn't sell
Misery waits in vague hotels
you're singing funeral songs
they're anabolic and bronze
in their millennial fogs
Till they fall down and deflate
And you wouldn't know what to say to yourself
Love is a poverty you couldn't sell
Misery waits in vague hotels
Oh and now you've had your fun
It's burned into your eyes
Leaves you plain and left behind
Oh see them eyes and fall
Into the jaws of a pestilent love
You wouldn't know what to say to yourself
Love is a poverty you couldn't sell
Misery waits in vague hotels
Straight to your door
Snakes have gone crazy tonight
Winding their way out of sight
They've come and gone
Doldrums are pounding
Cheapskates are clowning this town
Slow down this old train
Night birds will cackle
Rotting like apples on trees
Sending their dead melodies
I just found me a bottle of blues
Some strange comfort for a soul to soothe
And I been waiting for a year or a day
Some strange weather must be blowing my way
Holding hands with an impotent dream
In a brothel of fake energy
Put a nickel in a graveyard machine
I get higher and lower
I get higher and lower
Like a tired soldier with nothing to shoot
And nowhere to lose this bottle of blues
Egos drone and pose alone
Like black balloons all banged and blown
The infidels shiver in the stench of belief
And tell my momma I'm a hundred years late
I'm over the rails and out of the race
And the crippled psalms of an age that won't thaw
Are ringing in my ears
Holding hands with an impotent dream
In a brothel of fake energy
Put a nickel in a graveyard machine
I get higher and lower
I get higher and lower
Like a tired soldier with nothing to shoot
And nowhere to lose this bottle of blues
Some strange comfort for a soul to soothe
Holding hands with an impotent dream
In a brothel of fake energy
Put a nickel in a graveyard machine
I get higher and lower
I get higher and lower
Like a tired soldier with nothing to shoot
And nowhere to lose this bottle of blues
The night is useless and so are we
Is fallen apart at the seams
But the pleasures are seldom and few
Just the concrete and a worried mind
Till you feel safe in his arms
O maria haven't you known
Days so careless all on your own
And the animals have gone wild
But this place is so bright and so clean
There was no one nothing to see
The night is useless and so are we
Is fallen apart at the seams
The trains are wrecked
The night is younger then us
Nowhere is anywhere else
The exit signs are flashing
Dead ends they won't come to life
I should have guessed
Your love was hanging by threads
Tongues tied under the moon
Of broken bottles and tangled webs
The misers wind their minds
Like clocks that grind their gears
And if its met some accident
Crumbs fall out of the sky
Oh won't you lay my bags
Upon on the funeral fire
Oh won't you lay my bags
Upon on the funeral fire
It's so easy to laugh at yourself
When all those jokes have already been written
Seems like another vain attempt
To let yourself fall out of the oven
And it's a perfect day
To lock yourself inside
It's the same thing but it's almost as different
Hard to tell when it pacifies your mind
Leaves you stranded with a broken engine
Lazy desert looks so mangled
Let me drown in a convalescent bliss
Get up from your bed of rest
It's been a long time since you've lived
But the static in your mind
Leaves you hollow and unkind
With a shock electric wave
You've been flunked out of the devil's house
And some distortion that's never been known
On the treadmill you'll be running forever
And it's a perfect day
I lay upon the gravel
Pulls me one way or the other
In the evacuated heavens
Let's don't be like everyone else
Convalescents open their presents
Beggars and lightweights harness the highways
Let's don't be like everyone else
Sun stroke rivals recycling bibles
Let's don't be like everyone else
She had a body of sixteen or seventeen
She had a mind of forty
I met her on a cold day
With the worlds about zero
And I saw at once into her soul
She's gonna call me her hero
Never like a walk in the rain or the lane
I found a lot of death that day
She had a halo of gold
Told me stories of her life and the courage was sublime
She had a body of sixteen or seventeen
She had a mind of forty
With the worlds about zero
And I saw at once into her soul
She's gonna call me her hero
Never like a walk in the rain or the lane
I found a lot of death that day
She had a halo of gold
Told me stories of her life and the courage was sublime
By the dried up stream
We slit our throats and dreamed
When the building's burned
Was there some concern
Gather all your worldly jewels
And scatter them like fools
Don't you make a fuss
When day is done we'll ride
Who cares what we find
Another misspent night
We thought we got it right
The driver lost a wheel
The ice turned into steel
They shivered like refugees
Way down on our knees
By the dried up stream
We slit our throats and dreamed
When the building's burned
Was there some concerned
Looking back at some dead world that looks so new
Offices and fountains that they named for you
Girl you dream infectious from a nauseous heart
Choice cut meats from derelict boulevards
Hear that lonesome whistle blow
No direction to be known
A tearful gaze turns away
Looking back at some dead world that looks so new
Offices and fountains that they named for you
Terrorist confections look so out of place
Looking back at some dead world that looks so new
Looking back at some dead world that looks so new
Looking back at some dead world that looks so new
Can't you hear those cavalry drums
Hijacking your equilibrium
Midnight snacks in the mausoleum
Carnivores in the Kowloon night
Breathing freon by the candlelight
Coquettes bitch slap you so polite
Till you thank them for the tea and sympathy
The logic of all sex laws
Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists
But I'm not afraid to cry
Neptune's lips taste like fermented wine
Running buck wild like a concubine
Whose mother never held her hand
Brief encounters in Mercedes Benz
Wearing hepatitis contact lens
Bed and breakfast getaway weekends
With Sports Illustrated moms
The logic of all sex laws
Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists
But I'm not afraid to cry
The logic of all sex laws
Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists
I'm mixing business with leather
Christmas with Heather
Freaks flock together
She's always cold lamping
I just wanna watch you dance
Do you wanna ride on the Baltic Sea
Pour champagne on a honey bee
She can look right through me
I'm mixing fitness with leather
Homework with Heather
Freaks flock together
And make all the lesbians scream
Do you wanna ride on the Baltic Sea
Pour champagne on a honey bee
She can look right through me
We like the boys with the bullet proof vests
We like the girls with the cellophane chests
We like the boys with the bullet proof vests
We like the girls with the cellophane chests
I know you really want it
And he knows just how to flaunt it
He got pictures in his wallet
And he wanna be your lover
Does he cover you in butter
I want to know if I'm worth your time
There's so much to do before you die
Touch my ass if you're qualified
We like to ride on executive planes
We like to sit around and get real paid
We like to ride on executive planes
We like to sit around and get real paid
I know you really want it
And he knows just how to flaunt it
He got pictures in his wallet
And he wanna be your lover
Does he cover you in butter
I want to know if I'm worth your time
There's so much to do before you die
Touch my ass if you're qualified
I know you really want it
And he knows just how to flaunt it
He got pictures in his wallet
And he wanna be your lover
Does he cover you in butter
I want to know if I'm worth your time
There's so much to do before you die
We drop lobotomy beats
Dance floors and talk shows
I wanna know what makes you scream
Be your twenty million dollar fantasy
Hollywood freaks from the Hollywood scene
Touch it real good if you want a piece
Party people know I'm that type of freak
People look so snooty
Take pills make them moody
Local shopping malls receive
Looking like jail bait
Selling lots of real estate
Looking like a hot date
I wanna know what makes you scream
Be your twenty million dollar fantasy
Hollywood freaks from the Hollywood scene
Touch it real good if you want a piece
Party people know I'm that type of freak
Something tells me you want to go home
Custom clothes you own
Calling up from special area codes
Hollywood nuns with the Hollywood phones
I'll tell you what you want
Till the swimming pool boils
Let all the neighbors
Read it in the papers
Making all those gentlemen cry
I wanna know what makes you scream
Be your twenty million dollar fantasy
Hollywood freaks from the Hollywood scene
Touch it real good if you want a piece
Party people know I'm that type of freak
Probably have my baby
He wish he was a lady
Dance floors on all the talk shows
The snipers are passed out
Before the riots started
On the bread line tonight
Soon you'll be a figment
Of some infamous life
Billionaires smile like weapons
Passing out platinum pensions
They're out of control
No one knows how low they'll go
Take a ride on a broken train
Take a ride on a broken train
Those bra burning deportees
At the service station
Is the color of resignation
No one knows how low we'll go
Take a ride on a broken train
Take a ride on a broken train
Shining like crystal tiaras
Ghettos and gray Rivieras
You won't find no shelter here
No one knows how low we'll go
Take a ride on a broken train
Take a ride on a broken train
Don't take your red ribbons off
You're about to make a fool of yourself
In the aluminum sunset
Drinking from a drain
I'm a hundred miles behind myself
Pouring down like money
Make a poor boy wanna run
Did you hear those war torn stories
With the cold cola cans
You'll get the keys to the city for free
Pouring down like money
Bring a poor boy to his knees
Living in a garden of sleaze
Bangkok athletes in the biosphere
Pouring down like money
Bring a poor boy to his knees
Living in a garden of sleaze
Searchlights on the skyline
Just looking for a friend
Who's gonna love my baby
Egyptian bells are ringing
When it's her birthday
There's a hurricane blowing your way
There's someone calling your name
It's driving you insane
You were wearing that stained raincoat
And your umbrella was a tangled mess
You were washed up on the glittering shores
Looking for another crime to confess
You bribed yourself out of a place in the sun
But you had some change to spare
So you said you wanna spend it on me
And shook the blues out of your hair
There's someone calling your name
You're gonna miss that train
There's someone calling your name
The countryside is overgrown
There's a lighthouse in her soul
Wrestling with butcher girls
She don't ever change her clothes
Masterpieces liquidate in fertile tears
I could sleep inside her bones a hundred years
Lizards in the pressure zone
Mother knows it's only a phase
Cherry gardens feel like ice
Hazard lights from her past
Underneath the broken bridge
Hookers hug illegal dads
Masterpieces liquidate in fertile tears
I could sleep inside her bones a hundred years
Lizards in the pressure zone
Mother knows it's only a phase
Masterpieces liquidate in fertile tears
I could sleep inside her bones a hundred years
Lizards in the pressure zone
Mother knows it's only a phase
That I just got to get with
And you know what we're gonna do
I think her name's Debra
I pick you up late at night after work
Gonna take you for a real good meal
I just got to get with you girl
I think her name's Debra
Treated you like a rusty blade
A throwaway from an open grave
Cut you loose from a chain gang and let you go
And on the day you said it's true
Tried to tell you I never knew it could be so sweet
Blame the devil for the things you do
It's such a selfish way to lose
The way you lose these wasted blues
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
When the moon is a counterfeit
Better find the one that fits
Better find the one that lights the way for you
When the road is full of nails
Garbage pails and darkened jails
And their tongues are full of heartless tales that drain on you
You fade into a shaded room
It's such a selfish way to lose
The way you lose these wasted blues
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
I'm gonna love you all my life
I'm gonna let the world blow by
That's how long it took
I'm gonna love you all my life
I'm gonna let the world blow by
A diamond in the sleaze
A thousand grizzled nerves
It's later than you think
It's gone before you blink
Shakes his golden mane
He doesn't care who notices
You came to beg a meal
You're older than you feel
Keyboard of your memory
It's a weight upon my shoulder
It's a weight upon my shoulder
I won't ever let you go
I won't ever let you go
The doctor takes a rest
Inside a hornets nest
Polaroids of patients
Who refuse to be cured
A life lived under glass
Can you hear the saxophones
I won't ever let you go
I won't ever let you go
I won't ever let you go
I'm totally confused by you
I'm totally confused by you
You'll never understand
I'm totally confused by you
I'm totally confused by you
Put me in the suitcase
She had a body of sixteen or seventeen
She had a mind of forty
I met her on a cold day
With the worlds about zero
And I saw at once into her soul
She's gonna call me her hero
Never like a walk in the rain or the lane
I found a lot of death that day
She had a halo of gold
Told me stories of her life and the courage was sublime
She had a body of sixteen or seventeen

Never like a walk in the rain or the lane
I found a lot of death that day
She had a halo of gold
Told me stories of her life and the courage was sublime
The package I received is gone
I would glide with you
If you are a backwards ghost
Holy as a blessed worm
Bring me to your room
And I will throw you rocks today
And this is not a game or test
We both have done some grieving
A treasury you can't afford
Surgeries and innocence abounds
And I have read in paper books
My eyes are glands on twisted hooks
Never have I felt or looked
Tell me things I like to know
Dressing up from head to toe
Let them know to and fro
From here and tomorrow
The message I received is gone
I would glide with you
If you are a backwards ghost
Kiss the girl slay a hag
Feel the flavor freedom fag
Chase the murder with the rancid pores
The thyroids with friendly blade
The haunted beast with faces flayed
Silver chicken make a fuss
Reveling in molten puss
Favorite patrons crack their death
With arteries and tinsel breath
Revolution purple fist
Pummeling your angel piss
Sour powered wussy soul
Solid darkness goddess show
Weaving heirlooms through the hour
From the cradle monster cowered
Waking up delicious ghost
They'll eat themselves from coast to coast
Dancing in their bandages

Earthly mothers with flattened chests

Let's don't be like everyone else
Is it wrapped in trash
They said I got no place to be
The money meter's taking everything I see
Is it comes in lovely bones
Let the vultures drink and drown
Birds of feathers never frown
They said I got no place to be
The money meter's taking everything I see
Is it wrapped in trash
They said I got no place to be
Bust a move with what you can
Dead phone machine piled on the table
Disappointment is a feather in your cap
There's no map that can tell you where you are
You're in between things that only go half way
Bazookas and fisticuffs
Medicating in Porches
Norwegian hockey players passed out in government limos
Prime ministers with cryogenic faces
Autographs and paid vacations
Divorce papers and synthetic lubrications
Like a sleek diamond ice
Animal frequencies pinching deodorized nerves
Cosmetic procedures on the cartilage of apocalypse
Mannequin tycoons with airport piano bar mystiques
Flexing like suburban Spartacus
Getting smacked up by unemployed hand models
Underneath the flashing lights
Crawling on the basement floor
I can't see you anymore
Don't forget I'm on my knees
Make you feel what isn't real
You don't know my face is steel
Yellow diamonds in your eyes
Tell me what your daddy knows
Whichever way the wind blows
That's the way she goes
Now I think I'll never know
Saw you in the elevator late last night
You looked like you were off duty
Followed me down to the gym
Chromium sweat and a switchblade
With those millionaire dreams
I frequent places that take American Express
Watching liquid crystal displays in taxi cabs
Making midnight movies
Harnessed to a life of protein and equipment
Everyday a reaction to the affection
Manholes and light towers
Walking down imitation streets
Little girls with plastic cameras
And shops full of cold cuts and candy
Feeding the trains and bisecting the night
Hand grenades in the trash
Medics running from the sun
She borrowed cartilage wire
I'm mixing business with leather
Christmas with Heather
Freaks flock together
She's always cold lamping
I just wanna watch you dance
Do you wanna ride on the Baltic Sea
Pour champagne on a honey bee
She can look right through me
I'm mixing fitness with leather
Homework with Heather
Freaks flock together
And make all the lesbians scream
Do you wanna ride on the Baltic Sea

Freaks flock together
And make all the lesbians scream
Do you wanna ride on the Baltic Sea
Pour champagne on a honey bee
She can look right through me
I was born in a landslide
I worked on a railroad
If you got what it takes
They'll take what you got
Where the waters are wild
You wept like a mad dog
Can't you hear those cavalry drums
Hijacking your equilibrium
Midnight snacks in the mausoleum
Carnivores in the Kowloon night
Breathing freon by the candlelight
Coquettes bitch slap you so polite
Till you thank them for the tea and sympathy
The logic of all sex laws
Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists
But I'm not afraid to cry
Neptune's lips taste like fermented wine
Running buck wild like a concubine

Brief encounters in Mercedes Benz

Oh great. I had a tail put on by Dr. Gordon.
And I want to have some fat grafted onto it. I want to thicken it up.
That's because hair grows in three phases. All human bodies need at least three sessions of laser treatment.
But here is the best part of how we work.
And that's how we work.
It's about four feet long.
No. I have a tail attached to my spine.
Wow. That's a huge tail.
I know what you mean.
We thought we'd take a trip
We thought that we would go
Spend a weekend pleasant down in Mexico
I stuffed them all in a bag and I ducked down below
Well the boss got angry when he found out I didn't call the police
Concerning some jaywalking tickets
I couldn't afford to pay
So I went over to Dave's house
And got really stoned
Called up some girls but none of them were home
Well we thought we'd get some money
We thought that we might go
Spend a weekend pleasant down in Mexico
But the counter guy just laughed
And three Big Macs to go
Dave and Steve called their parents
And took the bus back home
Steve had a big commotion
The street fair was an ocean
When he took three tabs of bad acid
And off his melting jaw
All the wonderful things he saw
Well he looked out on the fairground
With the spinning things spinning all around
He threw up on the heel
Of the beautiful girl who was laughing
Well there must have been some pizza
And there must have been some fries
And there must have been some tequila
And there must have been some wine
And there must have been some beer
And there must have been some bagels
You could see it all so clear
And there must have been some pickles
And there must have been some catfish
Eternal nothingness. I offer myself so that you might
Cast your inscrutable dear silence upon me. o monstrous
Mystery beyond the realm of human thought. let me ask
For your grace and forgiveness in the knowledge that i
He's got rings on his fingers and knives all up his sleeves
He don't care you're not ready he don't care if you're not dressed
He sets your clothes on fire and brings you to your knees
He fills up the room with fashion and disease... well
My friend picked me up about quarter past five
We stopped and got some donuts and we took a little drive
And there's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck
There's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck or what
We spent many years always trying to get high
And there's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck
There's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck or what
Got some Molly Hatchet going on the stereo
And there's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck
There's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck
There's a fume in this truck
And I don't know if we're dead or what the fuck
There's a fume in this truck
The sun is down when I'm around
To walk the lane of wonderful pain
I live in jails and everything fails
I keep the trash and clean it for you
You should know better than to run around with your head cut off.
You should know better than to run around with your head cut off.
I'm so sorry if I can't talk good. I got squeezed and the feeling just escapes me.
You should know better than to run around with your head cut off.
You should know better than to run around with your head cut off.
Now you're shaking and you're much too sensitive. I feel awkward when I try to be myself.
You should know better than to run around with your head cut off.
Now she's spreading herself too thin
She gets bitchy and I can't make the grade
She runs free as a shrink in judgment
I don't need to cry on my pillow
Now my friend's putting down the gridlock
Is she using my natural attraction
Broken coffin is taken to extremes
Satan gave me a taco and it made me really sick
The chicken was all raw and the grease was mighty thick
The rice was all rancid and the beans were so hard
And after I was done the salsa melted off my tongue
Pieces of tortilla got stuck in my throat
And the stains on my clothes burned a hole through my coat
I was so dry and thirsty and I didn't have no cash
Turned on the water and it shot right up my nose
Some old lady came along and she thought I was a freak
So she beat me with a handbag till I could hardly speak
And I woke up on the ceiling and I couldn't find my hand
The courtroom was filled with witches and the dead
The prisoners were tied up and chained to the walls
My head was about to explode when I noticed the Marshall stacks
And I realized I was in a rock video
So I went and joined the band and I went out on tour
And I smoked a lot of heroin and I passed out in manure
And I gave it all away
So I started a solo career
And I won all the awards
And I drank all the beer
I opened up a taco stand
Just to smell the smell
I must be coming back too soon
Pieces of pieces lay in a pile
Somebody's walking on my hands
Everybody knows it's true
Everything is good as long it's stays still
Coins jingle in my brain
And you been watching me through your jewelry
Sending rings around my hands
Then your fingernails are much too long
Seems like everyone's just floating away
Gotta tie myself down
Tainted by the affliction
Seduced deeply into myself
Smeared darkly on the grave
Black confetti on the mango
Now it is time for pie
If I stay in the same place
The animals will lick my face
Soak in the dawn of day
Now it is time for pie
Put those sunglasses on your hips
Pass me a bag of potato chips
When I wanna put my money on a monkey
Give me a cold sore when you're young
Get old fast when you sag in the sun
Put a coffin lid on everyone
So you can be depressed
Your body on the mattress
She's got braids and broken arms
Talking at me like car alarms
When all the cars got stolen
Take me out to dinner
Take me out to dinner
Do the things you feel
Walk around with a broken leg
And a hundred dollar bill
Get yourself a pistol
Wake up without thinking
Put your hands on the wheel
Let the golden age begin
Feel the moonlight on your skin
Cool your aching head
The weight of the world
These days I barely get by
It's a treacherous road
With a desolated view
There's distant lights
But here they're far and few
You gotta drive all night
Just to feel like you're okay
These days I barely get by
Just like a paper tiger
Torn apart by idle hands
Fix yourself while you still can
No more ashes to ashes
No more cinders from the sky
Let all the laws of creation
Tell a dead man how to die
Oh deserts down below us
Like a stray dog gone defective
Like a paper tiger in the sun
Looking through a broken diamond
To make the past what it should be
Through the ruins and the weather
Capsized boats in the sea
Oh deserts down below us
Like a stray dog gone defective
Like a paper tiger in the sun
We're just holding on to nothing
To see how long nothing lasts
Oh deserts down below us
Like a stray dog gone defective
Like a paper tiger in the sun
There's one road to the morning
There's one road to the truth
There's one road back to civilization
There's a bluebird at my window
I can't hear the songs he sings
All the jewels in Heaven
They don't look the same to me
I just wade the tides that turned
Till I learn to leave the past behind
It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
All the battlements are empty
And the moon is laying low
Yellow roses in the graveyard
Got no time to watch them grow
Now I bade a friend farewell
I can do whatever pleases me
It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Press my face up to the window
To see how warm it is inside
See the things that I've been missing
Missing all this time
It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
But I'll try to leave behind some days
With promises that might come true for a while
Harder than I could just to meet you there
They cut through bone
There's too many people
They know your secrets
I'm tired of fighting
I'm tired of fighting
Fighting for a lost cause
There's a place where you are going
You ain't never been before
There's no one laughing at your back now
No one standing at your door
I'm tired of fighting
I'm tired of fighting
I've seen the end of the day come too soon
I've seen the end of the day come too late
Seen the love you had turning into hate
Had to act like I didn't even care
But I did so I got stranded standing there
It's nothing that I haven't seen before
But it still kills me like it did before
But it still kills me like it did before
I've seen the end of the day come too soon
Like the prison dogs they set out after you
You owe nothing to the past but wasted time
To serve a sentence that was only in your mind
It's nothing that I haven't seen before
But it still kills me like it did before
It's all in your mind
And it's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
Well I cannot believe
You got a devil up your sleeve
And he's talking to me
Well you're all scared and stiff
And the people you're with
They're all scared and stiff
We don't have to worry
Life goes where it does
Loose change we could spend
Grinding down diamonds
People pushing harder
Up against themselves
Make their daggers sharper
Than their faces tell
Loose change we could spend
All the pleasures of the day
All the treasures you could hold
Losing strength in every hand
They can't hold you anymore
Already dead to me now
Already dead to me now
In the harsh light of the day
On the edge of nothing more
In the light of what they lack
Already dead to me now
Already dead to me now
Haven't got a lot to learn
Looking for a satellite
In the rays of Heaven again
There's no other ending
Jealous minds walk in a line
And their faces jade the strain
Stranded in infinity rooms
And they're safe from any harm
There's no other ending
Yesterdays are ending
There's no other ending
Yesterdays are ending
There's no other ending
Yesterdays are ending
Altogether in a snake pit of souls
To throw your chains away
Today all you need is waiting
Like the evening prize
In a turnstile backwards we fly
Black ropes we pull from a swing
Today all of the dreams are waking
Can't stand on crooked legs
In these harbor lights
In a sea change nothing is safe
Today all we need is waiting
Today all of the dreams are waking
Something better than this
Someplace I'd like to go
About the kind of life
I never thought I'd live
Showed me what it did
Let it pass on the side of the road
What a friend could tell me now
The other side looks like
Across an empty floor
Let it pass on the side of the road
When I called you in the morning
You were struggling for sense
You were journeying through memories so vicious
You made all your dying wishes
But I know you're gonna try
To live without love by and by
But that's not living
That's just time going by
Another ship in the bottle
Has got no place to sail
To see the waves getting darker every hour
The stars have lost their power
But I know you're gonna try
To live without love by and by
That's just time going by
See me coming to town with my soul
Straight down out of the world with my fingers
Holding onto the devil I know
All my troubles will hang on your trigger
Take your eyes and your mind from the road
Shoot your mouth if you know where you're aiming
Don't forget to pick up what you sow
Talking trash to the garbage around you
See me kicking the door with my boots
Broke down out in a ditch of old rubbish
Snakes and bones in the back of your room
Handing out a confection of venom
Heaven's drunk from the poison you use
Charm the wolves with the eyes of a gambler
Now I see it's a comfort to you
Hammer my bones on the anvil of daylight
I won't give up that ghost
It's sick the way these tongues are twisted
There's too much left to taste that's bitter
I won't give up that ghost
It's sick the way these tongues are twisted
There's too much left to taste that's bitter
See the vegetable man in the vegetable van with a horn that's honking like a mariachi band.
See the vegetable man...
Fist pounding on a vending machine
Toy diamond ring stuck on her finger
With a noose she can hang from the sun
Put it out with her dark sunglasses
Walking crooked down the beach
She spits on the sand where their bones are bleaching
And I know I'm gonna steal her life
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her life
Nothing that I wouldn't try
And her rags were burning
Crawling out from a land filled life
Scrawling her name upon the ceiling
Throw a coin in a fountain of dust
Got a ticket for a midnight hanging
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving
And I know I'm gonna steal her life
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her life
Nothing that I wouldn't try
I prayed heaven today
Would bring its hammer down on me
And pound you out of my head
I can't think with you in it
I'd drag all that I owned
Down the dirt road to find you
They can't take me much farther
Something always takes the place of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing
The sun burned a hole in my roof
I can't seem to fix it
And I hope rain doesn't come
Wash me down the gutter
Something always takes the place of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing
Like a queen on a card
And the guns of her mind
Aim a line straight at mine
To a heart that is broke
Tried to feel but got choked
In the smoke of a desert
A beach with no treasure
A night that seems blue
Feed the aching in you
And the background birds
Take a flight from the earth
And the night current turns
On a lifeboat floating
Down a river of sleep
Can't see her hollow eyes
Walking along with my boots full of rocks
Can't believe these tears of mine
Something always takes the place of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing
Something always missing
Always someone missing something
Something always missing
Always someone missing something
Something always missing
Always someone missing something
Black hearts in effigy
We sing the song that was hated
All dressed like vagabonds
I know there's something wrong
Might take a fire to kill it
Might take a hurricane
Oh oh oh black tambourine
Oh oh oh black tambourine
Can't pay the rent again
These spider webs are my home now
And when the sun is down
We'll shake and rattle our bodies
To keep it warm at night
My tambourine is still shaking
Oh oh oh black tambourine
Oh oh oh black tambourine
Black hearts in effigy
We sing the song that was hated
All dressed like vagabonds
I know there's something wrong
Might take a fire to kill it
Might take a hurricane
Spaceships can't tame the jungle
And I feel like I'm giving in
We've been driving through a desert
Looking for a life to call our own
Dogs are hounding to themselves
Days are changing with the weather
Like a riptide come rip us away
Looking for my place on assembly lines
Fake prizes rising out of the bomb holes
Skeleton boys hyped up on purple
Smoke rings blow from across the disco
Bank notes burn like broken equipment
Floodgates open to the sound of the rainbow
Breaking points on the verge of pointless
Fools anointed to the follower's fanfare
Code red Cola War conformity crisis
Perfunctory idols rewriting their bibles
With magic markers running out of their ink
I know what you're thinking
I'll never forget you
Walking to the other side
With the devil trying to take my mind
And my soul's just a silhouette
On the ashes of a cigarette
Illusions never fake their lives
Trick cards fool the eyes
Bury tears in the chapters you shut
Sometimes the jail can't chain the cell
And the rain's too plain to tell
All alone by a barren well
Scarecrow's only scaring himself
I've been digging the ground
Beneath the dust and the clouds
I see miles and miles
I wanted hope from a grave
I wanted strength from a spade
What gives you comfort now
Might be the end of your vein
Crows are pulling at my clothes
The wind got my fingers froze
Over all the treasures we've lost
Sometimes the jail can't chain the cell
And the rain's to plain to tell
All alone by a barren well
The scarecrow's only scaring himself
Scarecrow's only scaring himself
See me down at the station
With my hands in my pocket
That I stole from a fountain
All the cares in the world
Climbing up on the back porch fence
With a ring and a question
And my shivering voice is singing
Through a crack in the window
In a long black shadow
Pull a hammer from a coal mine
Strike a match on the bathroom wall
Where my number was written
Driving on the sidewalk
See you down at the station
With my hands in my pocket
That I stole from a fountain
All the cares in the world
Climbing up on the back fence
With a ring and a question
In a voice that was singing
Underneath the window
Two white horses in a line carrying me to my burying ground.
Some need dollar bills lining their clothes.
Two white horses in a line taking me for my farewell ride.
Some may say this might be your last farewell ride...
Some may say this might be your last farewell ride...
Two white horses in a line carrying me to my burying ground.
Some may say this might be your last farewell ride...
Digging through ditches and falling to rust
Down where the reaper is walking alone
Digging through ditches and falling to rust
Never pawned my watch and chain to the landlord living inside my head.
Threw a Roosevelt dime in a bucket of rain.
I shake my leg on the ground like an epileptic battery man
No dead flowers gonna grow till the dirt gets wet
Put the elevator music on
Pull me back where I belong
The ambulance sings along
The fly on the wall doesn't know what's wrong
If I could forget myself
Find another lie to tell
If I had a soul to sell
I'd buy some time to talk to my brain cells
It's like the schoolhouse lights will never turn on again
The bodies all move to some backbone roots
Now you brush your teeth and you comb back your hair
You drive your vehicle like you just didn't care
And you walk into work with the boys and the girls
With your hand like a mirror you can see what's inside
When you're down and out
Pounded and there's nothing that's real
It's like a plastic heart
Too amputated to feel
I got a soda can bible song
The Lord took the weekend off
The fly on the wall doesn't know what's wrong
If I could forget myself
Find another lie to tell
The bottom of an oil well
All the dudes with banjos
I got my hand like a mirror
You can see what's around
I really think I better get a hold of myself
Don't wanna let the night get ahead of myself
She doesn't know what happens when she's around
But it makes me kinda nervous to say so
But it makes me kinda nervous to say so
Probably lay my head on a wooden floor
Tell her I was tired from working the store
Saving up to buy her something she wants
But it makes me kinda nervous to say so
But it makes me kinda nervous to say so
Keep it in a locket and I think of you
Take off your necklace and throw it away
But it makes me kinda nervous to say so
But it makes me kinda nervous to say so
Really think I better get a hold of myself
Don't wanna let the night get ahead of myself
She doesn't know what happens when she's around
Strange ways coming today
I put a dollar in my pocket and I threw it away
Been a long time since the federal dime
Made a jukebox sound like a mirror in my mind
Throw my hopes like a juggernaut walks
Sorry entertainers like aerobics victims
Hybrid people light a wooded matchstick
Toxic fumes from the burning plastic
Don't need a good reason to let anything rip
Mr. Microphone making all the damage felt
Like a laser manifesto make a mannequin melt
Going through the motions just to say that they did it
Treadmill's running underneath their feet
So let's put boots on the warehouse floor
Throwing equipment from a moving van
Grab a microphone like a utility man
Eye of the sun is out of its socket
All the riches and the ruins
Now we all know how that story ends
Standing on the last legs
Of a dream that walked away
When the Lord rings my front door
And asks me what I've got to show
Besides the dust in my pockets
And the things that just eat away my soul
Of a dream that got cremated
The least I had to lose from
Is the most I seemed to care
Anything should make you happy
Nothing could make you scared
We'll be on the shoreline
When that heavy ship goes down
No one cares what dress she wears at all
Tattered rags and paper bags and all
She's the one sleeping in the dirt
Lovers drag their canes across the gates
Gamblers light candles for the days
So put a candle on the window sill
Take your heart out of the shell
Take your heart out of the shell
And sweep our cares away with dirty brooms
Take your heart out of the shell
Take your heart out of the shell
I'm a seasick sailor on a ship of noise
I got my maps all backwards and my instincts poisoned
In a truth blown gutter full of wasted years
I push a shopping cart over in an Aztec ruin
With my minion fingers working for some God
Who could see his own reflection in a parking lot
Now I'm a priest teenager on a tower of dust
I'm a dead generator in a cloud of exhaust
I eat alone in the desert with skulls for my pets
And the lessons of the day
On the blackboard of night
Seem to be erased and the beacon has no light
The eyes of confusion are looking far astray
From everything you needed to keep the dogs at bay
And keep you just as safe as you are in my hands
Bye and bye and bye and bye
Every little word and every little step
And try to keep it with you and hold it like starling
From a frozen lake to a hollow moon
Push yourself beyond the wall they carved for you
And when you bring it down with all their false eyes
Disappointment condition
A perfunctory prescription
Of an indigent mindset
A belligerent silence
Turning out of a tin can
On the battery tape deck
Hovering in carbon monoxide cremations
Loners waste away inside
International dream bank
And if you get to the point
Then you are better than I
Vacant eyelids closing
Cities grew themselves
From a sky lit terrain
Riding out on the ice age
Ammunition souls shooting
Washing a soldier's bones
Punctured by the arrows
About the rules that bleed you
Just an eye that's closing
Cities grew themselves
From a scarlet terrain
Tell me your thoughts
I wanna live for a day
In the way that we lost
But unfortunately the twain
Left the keys in the car
So the legs have to walked
We were wayward and plain
Of what pain might do
To the pleasure we knew
Before we had to move on
I did my best for you
We dance alone this way
We dance alone this way
To come out of the ground
I tried to get back on the world
As it was turning around
From a life that crashed
Watching every minute
Of the wreckage go past
Till they're all smoothed out
Ducks and drakes over
Where we see there's only memories
We dance alone this way
We dance alone this way
We were waiting for hope
I was a light fading out
Like a stray on a rope
I let the scenery pass
Thought I saw a ghost
But it might have been me
Might have been the world
That was moving too fast
Caught up in the future
That was drunk on the past
Where the nights unravel
Trespassers travel on
We dance alone this way
We dance alone this way
And the target is an empty wall
We're out of patience
With smiles that cut across her face
But I wish I had more time for my brain
Where the sun doesn't know we're awake
Take a visit to the Pyrenees
Send a brochure from the agency
But my girlfriend dug a ditch in my room
Walking papers and a hole
Straight out from my shoes
No complaints but it's harder
To believe in the truth
So write a message on a billboard
And I'll send it to you
Check the status on the info line
Radiation from the factory
Thoughts get transported
With cellular headsets on their skulls
Gets you into this rhythm
Put their cities into ruins
Now we can feel what we're doing
We move the stratosphere in plastic
One thousand beats per minute
One thousand beats per minute
One thousand beats per minute
One thousand beats per minute
Categorizing in a crash
Tried to pull off this mask
But there was really a face
Which I just read from a plan
Security cameras strapped to his back
Media in a quarantined submission
Consultants with remote souls
Portions of the proceeds
Go to chain store victims
In the midget conditions
With remodeled kitchens
One thousand beats per minute
One thousand beats per minute
One thousand beats per minute
The shadow of a shadow is the ghost of a bomb
Skyscraper standing in a desert alone
A helicopter searchlight is searching for no one
We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top
The smokestack clouds with glory attached
We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top
The smokestack clouds with glory attached
The sky creatures dance in a parking lot wind
That blows from a tundra where the jungle begins
The lord will take his motorcade and drive us into the dirt
We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top
The smokestack clouds with glory attached
We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top
The smokestack clouds with glory attached
There's a skyscraper on the moon
And a man standing on a window
There's a light beaming through the galaxy
We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top
We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top
We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top
We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top
The information is laughing at us
The ticker tape feeds the night
Looking for a lost transmission
A heaven that we left behind
When the information comes
We'll know what we're made from
And the skyline rising
Say hello to a mannequin
The ghost of an automaton
The witching hour is summoning up
Armies where they don't belong
When the information comes
We'll know what we're made from
And the skyline rising
She's the sister of avarice
The wife of a poisonous tide
She's the eye of a battle of storms
That sees where the atoms collide
When the information comes
We'll know what we're made from
And the skyline rising
Looking for a ladder in the stratosphere
I carry my heart like a soldier with a hand grenade
Walking down the aisle in the supermarket
Looking for the things for to carry my senses away
And listen to the ring of the telephone
Looking for a home in the magazine page
Wages in my pocket gonna buy me anything that I need
My mind is awake and anything could lead me astray
Listen to the voice on the radio wave
Banality lives where hysteria kills
Civilian jungles with malaria pills
Animals bleed to buy a star from the night
Avenue kids wear a scar like a stripe
Send up a signal to the heavenly rescue
When the poison's coming from the person you're next to
Let the voltage of thought pull the plug from the wound
This thought is a perjury blindfold
When she crawls from the Himalayan rain
With the birds of prey and weapons on fire
Don't call it death on the installment plan
Raking the coals over the tracks
Taking the knife out from the stack
She's bringing the blood that I have back
She's coming to see it's all a sin
She's coming to see the sun again
Coming to wash it off again
Coming to see herself again
Coming to see herself again
Coming to wash it off again
The weather reports from the Bristol radio station for 0400 GMT
1 thousand and ten falling slowly
1 thousand and 7 rising while slowly
Subtle. It doesn't push. It nudges. It entices or seduces.
It has to encompass the whole world.
Because ultimately that's what space travel is all about.
Was sending up ships from earth into space.
Think I'm stranded but I don't know where
I got this diamond I don't know how to shine
In the sun where the dark winds wail
And these children leave their rulers behind
The matchsticks for my bones
If we can learn how to freeze ourselves alive
We can learn to leave these burdens to burn
Cast out these creatures of woe
Who shatter themselves
Fighting the fire with your bare hands
Now my journey takes me further south
I want to hear what the blind men sing
With their fossils and their gypsy bones
I'll stand beside myself so I'm not alone
And how can I make new again
What rusts every time it rains
And the rain it comes and floods our lungs
If I wake up and see my maker coming
With all of his crimson and his iron desire
We'll drag the streets with the baggage of longing
To be loved or destroyed from a void
Your brains are bored like a refugee from a house that's burning
And she speaks inside a cloud with her countenance turning around
Hit me like a gamma ray standing in a hurricane
I want to know what I've lost today
And your body's bored like a refugee from a house that's burning
I can't believe what we've seen outside
You and me watching the jets go by
You and me watching a sea full of people
You and me watching a sky
That's where we belong
All I can take from these skies is hope
But all I can see in this light are boats
Down by the sea swallowed by evil
They've already drowned
You and me watching a sea full of people
You and me hit by a touch of white evil
Watching the jet planes go by
That's where we'll be when we die in the slipstream
I feel uptight when I walk in the city
I feel so cold when I'm at home
I lost my bearings ten minutes ago
Misapprehension is turning into convention
Don't know what I've done but I feel ashamed
Standing outside the glass on the sidewalk
These people talk about impossible things
And I'm falling out of the conversation
Like a pawn piece in a human shield
Modern guilt is all in our hands
Modern guilt won't get me to bed
There's a bottomless pit that we've been climbing from
Just to get on level ground
Shake your seasick legs around
Everyone in a logo town
Signs of life are stark and flickering
I need a bed to lay my body down
Dead weight to carry me down
Some static is lulling me to sleep
Hang your clothes on a chain link fence
In a junkyard say amen
Your mouth is full of wordless hymns
And we're helpless and forgetting in the background holding nothing
There's a million horse dragging down a monolith
These trademarks so bereaved
Tied my leg to a barricade
They tried to turn emotion into noise
I need a teleprompter for my life
Need a pipeline to the night
My body can't get no relief
And this life it goes by fast
To treading water in the past
While you try to reanimate something that you don't understand
And we're helpless and forgetting in the background don't saying nothing
And he's helpless and forgetting in the background don't saying nothing
Some days we get a thrill in our brains
Some days it turns into malaise
You see our face in the veneer
Reflected on the surface of fear
Because you know that we're better than that
But some days we're worse than you can imagine
With all these train wrecks coming at random
You got warheads stacked in the kitchen
You treat distraction like it's a religion
With a rattlesnake step in your rhythm
We do the best with the souls we've been given
Because you know we're nothing special to them
We're going some place they've already been
Trying to make sense of what they call wisdom
You're wearing all the years on your face
Turn a tombstone into your own place
And your heart only beats in a murmur
Make a perfect replica of your life
I was the last to see me down on my knees
These antibodies learn to be the disease
And I learn to be what fights against me
And we could live in a hollow tree
Grow up old and bury the sea
And when this replica begins to look cheap
I'll throw it out but now it's home to me
Beat my bones against the wall
Staring down an empty hall
Deep down in a hollow log
Coming home like a letter bomb
That covered the night
Put a fire into your bones
Sic a dog on all you know
Cut it loose before you go
That covered the night
Beat my bones against the wall
Put a bank note on your bond
Gris Gris and a goldenrod
Down deep in a hollow log
That buried the night
In a cast iron cage you couldn't help but stare like a creature
With the laws of a brothel and the fireproof bones of a preacher
And your lingo coined from the sacrament of a casino
On a government loan with a guillotine in your libido
These profanity prayers
Well you know how it looks when you pull all your books from the table
And you stare into space trying to discern what to say now
And you wait at the light and watch for a sign that you're breathing
I don't know where they're gonna lead anymore
But I think I must have seen a ghost
I don't know if it's my illusions that keep me alive
I don't know what I've seen
And all that it feeds
I don't know if it's already crashed on the shore
I don't know if I'm sane
But there's a ghost in my heart
Who only wanna be pleased
But I still wanna please you
And I heard of that Japanese girl
Who jumped into the volcano
All I've got left is the taste of salt in my mouth
I don't know where I've been
I don't wanna fall in though
Just wanna warm my bones
From a long night in the storm
Looked up this morning
Saw the roses full of thorns
Mountains are falling
They don't have nowhere to go
The ocean's a diamond
Only shines when you're alone
We've gone all around
Till there's nothing left to say
We've wore it all down
Into something that couldn't be saved
And buried me underneath the weight
Free as a driving wheel
Circling around your iron will
See only what you feel
Keeps you turning when you're standing still
You try to run from trouble when it comes
High as the light of day
You're falling down across your lost highway
You've lost your tongue when you fall from the pendulum
Your heart is a drum keeping time with everyone
Hear the drum from the undertow
Need to find someone to show me how to play it slow
Your eyes get stung by the rays of the sinking sun
You follow the drum keeping time with everyone
See the sleet that rests upon
The quiet street we're standing on
Is it time to go away
These are the words you use to say goodbye
On my back and she is gone
Time will tell and I will go
These are the words we use to say goodbye
These are the words we use to say goodbye
Empty out an empty drawer
These are the words you use to say goodbye
I'm so tired of being alone
These penitent walls are all I've known
Songbird calling across the water
Inside my silent asylum
Left me standing all alone
Cut me down to size so I can fit inside
Lies that will divide us both in time
See the turncoat on his knees
A vagabond that no one sees
When a moon is throwing shadows
You can't save the ones you've caught in battle
Left me standing all alone
Cut me down to size so I can fit inside
Lies you try to hide behind your eyes
Don't leave me on my own
Don't leave me on my own
So cut me down to size so I can fit inside
Away from the daylight
Time will wait for you
Just let the engine run
Till there's nothing left
Except the damage done
Time will wait for you
I move away from this place
In the form of a disturbance
And enter into the world
Like some tiny distortion
And I don't fight this wave
I'll only be carried away
You better save yourself
From something you can't see
Follow it where it goes
You don't have to let it go away
These are some faults we found
Hollowed out from the years
Don't let them wear you out
Don't let them turn your mind inside out
You don't have to let it go away
In the crossfire there's a story
Give me traces of your lifeblood flowing
And tell me I'm dream dream dream dreaming
And I'll never wake up
A keepsake in a dresser drawer
A symbol of your exegesis
An SOS from an outpost there
I could read you a brief account
We could come to understand what's wrong
At rock bottom of a hollowed ground
From the sound of your own voice
Run to see you at the edge
Fall off the avalanche
That fixes you in time
The wall that love divides
Between waking and slumber
From the weight of your own past
It's a measure for the devil
And betray the lack of change
Where I found my proving ground
Wheels are turning around
The hills roll out like centuries
Pass by without a sound
Just a mile outside of town
Where the limit to your sky fell down
The plot against your will
Is furrowed into your brow
Against your better judgment
It's all behind you now
Just a mile outside of town
What's the use in being found
In the weeds hiding down river right next door
There's no frame around your picture
Just a view through my back door
You just found what you're looking for
A tiger rose growing through your prison door
Just a mile from my back door
Running in the undertow my heart couldn't fight against
Where I found my proving ground
Waves are turning around
The hills roll out like centuries
Pass by without a sound
Brace yourself to the morning alone
You've waited long enough to know
When the memory leaves you
Somewhere you can't make it home
When the morning comes to meet you
Lay me down in waking light
It's in your lamplight burning low
When the memory leaves you
Somewhere you can't make it home
When the morning comes to meet you
Rest your eyes in waking light
When the memory leaves you
Somewhere you can't make it home
When the morning comes to meet you
I'll find you and go right through walls we made
Found our way through the lost years
Now the day brings it all here
I've got all the love you need
I've got all the love you need
I don't have the time to wait
I don't have the time to wait
Got it all under control
Got it all under control
Now it only hurts to know
Now it only hurts to know
Found our way through the lost years
Now the day brings it all here
And I'm out in the city in the typical noise
With the suntan ellipse and the filigree of energy
Now I'm down on my knees with a pocket full of widows
You can do it down here what you never did there
When you feel untethered from the broken veneer
Don't tell nobody I'm here
Don't tell nobody I'm here
Now you got to let me know or you got to let me go
I'm gonna take it with me
I'm gonna take it with me
I'm gonna take it with me
I've seen it all come clean like a guillotine rose
I want to wake up in the shadow of a fever pitch
I hear the voice over the phone
Now you got to let me know or you got to let me go
I'm gonna take it with me
You can change your mind but you can't forget her
You can change your mind but you can't forget her
So let it rise to the highest high in the satellite sky
So let it rise to the highest high in the satellite sky
I see the silhouette of everything I thought I ever knew
And the way that I walk is up to me now
You can hear me from Topeka to Belize now
They never see that I got no need to bend my knees down
Who am I supposed to be in the middle of the day
They try to keep me down with affliction
A horizontal aspiration in the basement
And the way that I walk is up to me now
You can hear me from Topeka to Belize now
They never see that I got no need to bend my knees down
Nobody's gonna keep me down
You sang your swan song to the dogs
You drove your Rolls into the swamp
Of the price they put upon your soul
You buy it back from the burning ashes of the devil you know
It's not the words I want to tell you
It's not the tension that I feel
It's not the face that I'm showing you today
And everything that I know went wrong
And if it means that it's done and I'm a fool
But I don't want to forget what we've been through
Just to save us both from what we knew
They pull you in all directions
They pull you in all directions
It's not the objects that I hold in my possession
It's not the worldly things that shine
Sometimes the worst will come and bring us back together
And I really don't know what I want
In everything that I know went wrong
And if it means that it's done and I'm a fool
When I want to forget what we've been through
Just to save us both from what we knew
They pull you in all directions
They pull you in all directions
There's so many ways to live or love or die
Wasting time trying to prove things
And now I really know what I want
In everything that I know went wrong
If it means that it's done and I'm a fool
Don't want to forget what we've been through
Just to save us both from what we knew
They push you in all directions
Come on out of your dreams
And wake up from your reverie
The streets are running on the brink
They say that we've got nothing
But a dollar for a life of sin
Close your eyes and you're gone
Nothing gonna get me in my world
If you want to fall in a dream
You could put the weight right onto me
Close your eyes and you're gone
Nothing gonna get me in my world
Nothing gonna get me in my world
Close your eyes and you're gone
Nothing gonna get me in my world
Nothing gonna get me in my world
Wanna move into a fool's gold room
Swimming pools full of animal jewels
All the rules that you choose to use to get loose
With the luminous moves
Living every day like it's just about to end
My demon's on the cell phone
It's just another perfect night
We're gonna take it around the world
We're gonna take it around the world
All these wild horses
All these wild horses
We're gonna take it around the world
When you get the rhythm and words all make you cold
When they break it down and this world is all you know
Now I'm feeling so far away
To see the colors and all the kids going home
Night is crawling up to the day
Just wanna stay up all night with you
Just wanna stay up all night with you
There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do
Just wanna stay up all night with you
I've been jumping through some hoops
Wanna get my body loose
On a wheel like an animal struggling
I just wanna stay up all night
Wanna stay up all night
Just wanna stay up all night with you
If you don't really care
Let them know that you're there
If you got the time to take it up there
Living out on a prayer
Let them know that you're there
If you got the time to take it up there
If you got the time to take it up there
I've been watching the wheels turning
But I'm learning to enjoy the ride
On the road to nowhere
I hope we get there soon
Knocking on purgatory's door
Changing colors on demand
Taking detours in your mind
You'll be fine if you try
To keep your eyes on the consolation prize
When you lower your expectations
And you've run out of patience
It's all a part of the plan when you're lost in the world
And you're going down hard for the girl
I've been running the lights in the city
My demons told my skeletons
And when I got to the dark side of the moon
All the trouble I thought I knew
Chasing rainbows in your mind
You'll be fine if you try
To keep your eyes on the consolation prize
On the road to tomorrow
It's all a part of the plan when you're dead to the world
And you're going down hard for the girl
Sooner or later at the end of the world
Taking detours in your mind
You'll be fine if you try
To keep your eyes on the consolation prize
On the road to Valhalla
Karma riding shotgun with drama
It's all a part of the plan when you're lost in the world
Take a little piece of me
Start a new history and trace it back to me
Someday you might see
I don't mind if the sea
Washes over the city tonight
I don't mind if the sea
Washes over the city tonight
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
The whole night through
You'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do
And crave the love you threw away
The time will come when you'll be blue
You'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do
I don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicon hump
Dressed like a priest you was
Todd Browning's freak he was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and your knees
Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
You'll catch your death in the fog
There's gonna be sorrow
Try and wake up for tomorrow
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
Onto the street below
You'll catch a death in the fog
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
There's nothing left to hide
You can see it in my eyes
Oh I've tried to be who I thought you wanted
And if it's all a lie
The truth's not far behind
We could try to live right for the moment
It's less than what I felt
I'll keep your door locked tight
I'll keep your children safe
I don't care if it takes all night
Pumping in your veins
Turncoat poison in the dropping rain
In the gaslight hours
Hear the ghost on the train
I've seen the worst of it
I don't care if it takes all night
The new breed is pausing for silence
The old guard is letting us down
The children pushing and pulling
The life chains rattle around them
Eyes closed to see what you're supposed to
Believe in whatever you wanted
Children running to ruin
Their arms up under surrender
The Gods are nothing between us
I was driving home in a Dodge Stratus
To the contaminated side of town
Where the shortwave radio playing songs of the century
And a big black cloud of asbestos
Was shadowing my demise
With the honor and your attitude
And your jeans full of prison food
There's a police chalk outline where you last been seen
I was lacerated by my indiscretions
Of a damsel in stonewashed denim
The way that her sideways ponytail fell
Playing bass solos up on the sun
With your syntax in the post
And a clothes pin on your nose
And a septic tank full of all the stories you told
She invited me up to a condo door
Way down in a neon park
With your dry ice machine
There's a police chalk outline where you last been seen
Laminate your face and paste it up into the sky
Completely rancid and beautiful
Like a forcefield of multiplying meat
Cut a hole in the floor to see
Time shoots forward in your skull
Scattered to the four winds chucked in a bucket
Amplified dishwashers
Exploring the boring to the core
People with cordless personalities
California white boy sound
Straight to the middle of the road
Play the whole thing backwards
And paste it up into the sky
Completely rancid and beautiful
Like a dishrag laying in the street
Uptight beyond belief
Cut a hole in the floor to see
How close to hell we're standing
Police lady staring at my shoes
Pretentious dimensions exploring the boring to the core
Adults with cordless personalities
Running around in new wave bionic jogging suits
California white boy sound
Straight to the middle of the road
Just rewind the tape and play the whole thing backwards
Throw your inspiration in your station wagon
I'm so weary of taking up space
Sending junk mail to the whole human race
Stole my genome from the salt of the earth
Weighed my brain for to see what it's worth
Beauty's burning but my backbone feels so cold
Little girl with the protean hands
White lightning that she got from Japan
Mannequins just melt in the sun
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Now the bonfire's burning my face
Generic rails that I like to deface
Landladies turn to pillars of salt
Like missile silos where the alpha males go
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
You open up the door with negative aura
You say the future is murky indeed
I'm sick of hearing your gripe
Open up the door with negative aura
I think There is no way my life fizzle out
You open up the door with negative aura
You say the future is murky indeed
I'm sick of hearing your gripe
Open up the door with negative aura
There is no way my life fizzle out
If you are at a loss as to what to do
Raise you stiff middle finger
It will know which way the wind blows
Don't chain your affection
Awaken primal feeling
Sing out primal scream
Let loose every feeling from joy to grief
Don't chain your affection
Awaken primal feeling
Sing out primal scream
Let loose every feeling joy to grief
Game is in your hands
Follow your brainstorm
Get wise tie yourself down
Breakdown a stick tight empty smile mask
Don't chain your affection
Awaken primal feeling
Sing out primal scream
Let loose every feeling from joy to grief
Don't chain your affection
Awaken primal feeling
Sing out primal scream
Let loose every feeling from joy to grief
Don't chain your affection
Awaken primal feeling
Sing out primal scream
Let loose every feeling from joy to grief
Don't chain your affection
Awaken primal feeling
Sing out primal scream
Let loose every feeling from joy to grief
Game is in your hands
Born upon a dark sky and shining on my dark side
That led me ahead and took me away to the better ways
Born upon a dark sky and shining on my dark side
I see the one that rise on me
Shining up all around the world
It's the brightest in the world
The birds are singing and a road is winding
My heart is beating and I'm in the sound
I see the one that rise on me
Shining up all around the world
Here comes the only one
Here comes the only one
Baby please come home
I got a bird that whistles
Got a bird that sings
I got a bird that whistles
Got a bird that sings
But I ain't got Corrina
Life don't mean a thing
Girl you're on my mind
Girl you're on my mind
All my days I had moldy bread
Robot brains and the flying airplanes
Rocking like a hurricane under the rug
Bored to the core on a sunken boat
A worn out candle and a plastic coat
Waking up in the shadow of a piece of dirt
Gonna leap right out the wall
Gonna walk around this town with a can of whiskey
Gonna run like a bird
Gonna roll out in the dirt
Gonna run around this town with a phone machine
Yellow cat laying flat on the road
Molten lead shooting out the ground
Tinfoil witch burning under the bridge
Flap your wings and leap out the window
Put a glass eye in the eyes of God
Gonna jump like a flag
Gonna burn like a pig
Gonna flap around and pass out on the kitchen floor
Gonna crawl like a rock
Gonna dance like a worm
Gonna take my shoes right off and smell my socks
Gonna swim like a chicken
Gonna melt like a weasel
Gonna get my walkie talkie and some mustard and some mayonnaise
And some telephone wires and phone machines
Big bloody wallet full of snakes
On these countless men
Curses on their trespasses
Curses on their blades
On the spare and open lanes
Once I've been searching
Curses on their children
While I'm rusting in the ground
I might rise up to meet them
When they leave this life
Might rise up to eat them
When they leave this life
Curses on this valley
And the lands on up ahead
I was on my way to meet them
When they found me dead
And I clapped my brittle hands
And I made them join my game
Now I hope they all decease
And marry a man in shame
That's planted on their lips
Curse the sleek machine
And their iron colored ships
Curse every wave that
Pounds a wicked shore
Knocking on their door
And I am not a creature
I have no claim to be there
Staring through the air
Have no say in anything
My tongue is barely there
Some of them are weeping
Some of them have worn
So deep they feel no pain
Curses on their fingers
I shoot the lights out now
When it's day for night to disappear
I train my eyes on love
Through the darkened lines
Left to pull up traps on my face
And with hearts to laugh
Tell me will I look good
Put me in your helicopter
Live the day before you turn it
Live the day before you turn it
Live the day before you turn it
Live the day before you turn it
Must have been the devil
Believe that woman has gone mad
Must a been the devil
Believe that woman has gone mad
Change my baby's mind
Nothing but the devil
Change my baby's mind
Laid there last night
And tried to take my best
My mind got to rambling
Like wild geese from the west
Must have been the devil
Believe that woman has gone mad
Must have been the devil
Believe that woman has gone mad
Took off with my best friend
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicon hump
Dressed like a priest you was
Todd Browning's freak he was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and your knees
Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
You'll catch your death in the fog
There's gonna be sorrow
Try and wake up for tomorrow
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
Onto the street below
You'll catch a death in the fog
Can't forget my plastic get down
Ghost electric telephone bones
Blowing like horns about to shout
Nasty distortion down on the slow jam
All my friends got Dixie soul
Rocking the plastic Taking the low road
Totem poles in the briefcase shows
Gonna let me get with the jet effect.
Gonna let me get with the jet effect.
Vandalized as I didn't have no time
Up the river and round the road
Gonna let me get with the jet effect.
Looking for my place on assembly lines
Fake prizes rising out of the bomb holes
Skeleton boys hyped up in purple
Smoke rings blow from across the disco
Looking for shelter via juxtaposition
Power is raunchy when the cops are watching
Floodgates open to the sound of the rainbow
Fools anointed to the follower's fanfare
Perfunctory idols rewriting their bibles
With magic markers running out of their ink
Where the fourteen rivers did meet
The bones of our elders
On a dark and dusty deserts
Like a ghost I've flown
I barely cried when I arrived
And when there is no shelter
I lay down on the ground
I killed every reason
They gave for me to stay
And dragged that thing away
There's saints and there is animals
They've taken what they could
And it's written in the pages
Do just like they should
They stood the test and burned the rest
And tore them limb from limb
And it's marked upon their faces
It's written on their skin
Dig my grave with a silver spade
Insane in the mundane
Yeah I got the flavor
Yeah I got the flavor
Yeah got the taste...
Oh got the flavor in my gut
Oh yeah shake your guts
Ding dong funky little song
Now that we got our funky little song
Bad vibrations are all around
When your house is upside down
And you're waiting for something
To help yourself along
Ding dong funky little song
Now that we got a funky little song
Ding dong funky little song
Now that we got a funky little song
Ding dong funky little song
When the mean person is mean
You just look that mean person
And then you sing your funky little song
Right at that mean person
Ding dong funky little song
Now that we got a funky little song
Ding dong funky little song
Now that we got a funky little song
Ding dong funky little song
Now that we got a funky little song
Ding dong funky little song
Now that we got a funky little song
Ding dong funky little song
Looking for my place on assembly lines
Fake prizes rising out of the bomb holes
Skeleton boys hyped up in purple
Smoke rings blow from across the disco
Looking for shelter via juxtaposition
Power is raunchy when the cops are watching
Clinched wasted hate taste tested
Floodgates open to the sound of the rainbow
Fools anointed to the follower's fanfare
Perfunctory idols rewriting their bibles
With magic markers running out of their ink
Straight down out of the world with my fingers
Holding onto the devil I know
Take your eyes and your mind from the road
Shoot your mouth off if you know where you're aiming
Don't forget to pick up what you sow
Talking trash to the garbage around you
Broke down out in a ditch of old rubbish
Snakes and bones in the back of your room
Handing out a confection of venom
Heaven's drunk from the poison you use
Charm the wolves with the eyes of a gambler
Now I see it's a comfort to you
Hammer my bones on the anvil of daylight
I won't give up that ghost
It's sick the way these tongues are twisted
The good in us is all we know
There's too much left to taste that's bitter
I won't give up that ghost
It's sick the way these tongues are twisted
The good in us is all we know
There's too much left to taste that's bitter
Gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme
Do the things you feel
Walk around with a broken leg
And a hundred dollar bill
Get yourself a pistol
Walk till you're restless
Sleep till you're tired
Wake up without thinking
I kneel before the green light
Of her singing crayon eyes
And then I kiss her stomach
Her light is the night
I kneel before the green light
Of her singing crayon eyes
And then I kiss her stomach
Her light is the night
Well it could be good
Make us love each other
Child grows up to see
It's great to see you
I love your big house
Could you spare a dime
We could stop the world
And let off all the fools
So I broke out in a sweat
And I spent it to death
And it's hard to compete
When you're beating your teeth on the ground
Did you ever even think about the impression
That you gave to the pigs
With the hazardous waste in their wine
And their gasoline hormones
You said try a combination
I was over and under my age
Like a dead man moving too quick
It's purposely out of control
She's tidying up the grunge
The expectations were pulsing so pure
And the rest of the best was a big mistake
I prayed Heaven today
Bring its hammer down on me
And pound you out of my head
I can't think with you in it
I dragged all that I owned
Down the dirt road to find you
My shoes worn out and used
They can't take me much farther
Something always takes the place of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing
Something always takes the place of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing
Where the bonfire burns and the night current turns
I can't see her hollow eyes
I can't believe these tears were mine
I'll give them to you to keep away in a box
I'll give them to you to keep away in a box
I'll give them to you to keep away in a box
I'll give them to you to keep away in a box
Something always takes the place of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing
Something always missing
Always someone missing something
Something always missing
Always someone missing something
Something always missing
Always someone missing something
Something always missing
With their eyes all full of stars and their heads in the clouds
With the failure to keep both feet on the ground
When you're shackled to the shadow and the ghost
You could learn to leave your long lost days alone
Anyone who's learned their lesson and burned their hands
They'll steal someone else's answers if they can
When the answer is that there's none to be had
When you're shackled to the shadow and the ghost
You could learn to leave your long lost days alone
Now that you know how high the hook and ladder goes
From the highest rung down to the lowest low
When you're shackled to the shadow and the ghost
You could learn to leave your long last days alone
Looking back at some dead world that looked so new
Abysses and fountains that they named for you
Joyous cat reaches from derelict bullet flies
Hear their lonesome whistle blow
Looking back at some dead world that looked so new
Abysses and fountains that they named for you
Looking back at some dead world that looked so new
Looking back at some dead world that looked so new
Looking back at some dead world that looked so new
Pineapples and kumquats
Simultaneously exploding
Cokes in the fruit of eternity
Lighting matchsticks and candles
Drawing pictures with god
Severing the tires of god
Covering yourselves with masking tape
From these shores where we belong
I have seen the the land beyond
Where the lord is strange and strong
I have seen the the land beyond
There's no telling who'll be dead
When the pale horse is turning red
And the tongues will burn in vain
And everything will feel the same
There's no patience there's no peace
I have seen the land beyond
Where the gravestones never cease
I have seen the the land beyond
Through the troubles of years
The heavenly apparition appears
And we're haunted by our own minds
From these shores where we belong
I have seen the the land beyond
I'll be there and I'll be gone
I just started to see the light of day
Some people say one thing but act the other way
Sooner or later they give themselves away
And I just started to see the light of day
I just started hating some people today
Talking trash behind your back all day
Saying things that a garbage man would not say
And I just started hating some people today
I just started wanting to kill someone
Cause one look at my eye and you will run
I just started wanting to see you dead
At least one half of the double life you lead
And I just started wanting to see you dead
I just started wanting to punch your face
You might wanna wear a helmet just in case
What was once your face is gonna be replaced
And I just started wanting to punch your face
I just started hating some people today
Some others I don't even think I have to name
I'm gonna kill you Randy
I'm gonna watch you die
With a fresh pack of gum
I picked you up late at night after work
I said gonna take you out to Glendale
I only wanna get with you
And your sister... Debra
I'm gonna take you up to Glendale
Take you for a real good meal
And when our eyes did meet
The time is almost over
So come a little closer
I try now I can't fight it
... Being invective ...
I'm counting down the minutes
From an hourglass full of ice
Can't you hear the catchy station
Coming from another car
No one has a clue where we are
Cause things are getting silly
We're covered in a secret
Cause there's nowhere else to keep it
I've been set free and I've been bound
To the memories of yesterday's clouds
I've been set free and I've been bound
I'm set free to find a new illusion
I've been blinded but
What in the world has happened to me
The prince of stories who walk right by me
I'm set free to find a new illusion
I've been set free and I've been bound
Let me tell you people
I saw my head laughing
Rolling on the ground
Get the squeegee and it's easy to be me
Your brother is deader than a phone machine
With a bucket of green piss
And the people don't breathe
And the mayonnaise comes
I can pick my own nose and put it back in
Smoke a pack of whiskey with Jesus Christ
Your daddy's got laxatives on his brain
I love you but you don't know how to spell
Where can you duck when they shoot you full of pigeon holes
And the people don't breathe
As you're biting my sandwich
It's like forty pounds of avocado sauce
Smeared across your boss
All we used will hold us together
If you take a road out from under me
If you stare the sun out of the sky
Take a voice back from the ventriloquist
Inside out when you get older
In between and over your shoulder
Throw my soul in a river of mirrors
Let the fireworks drown in the gutter
Cowboy magician with vandalized fiction
Get these plastic fangs out of my neck
So easy to tune it all out again
When all is said and done
And you're the last thing on my list
But you're the first thing I'm gonna remember
It's all gonna come to be
The same bad video for twenty years
It's all gonna come to be
Optimistic xerox of yourself
You can pack it up and put it on the highway
You can fill up the air with bad breath
And filtered back into the system
And the space age is running out of distance
And disconnect all the connections
Program the appliances to puke on the floor
It's all gonna come to be
The same old noise you never wanted to see
Are those clogs or platform shoes
Vandalizing everything you own
The same bad scene for 20 years
Optimistic xerox of yourself
Predictions of debilitating health
Whining all night long
Climbing into the rafters
Taking karate lessons
Wrote the book of the seventh seal
Wrote the book of the seventh seal
And he led twelve away
Wrote the book of the seventh seal
If it's really that expensive kind
You know it balances on your head
Just like a mattress balances
We'll go out and see it sometime
We'll both just sit there and stare
Wrapped around my head
But I sure wish he'd take that off his head
I never seen him before
You forgot to close the garage door
You might think he loves you for your money
But I know what he really loves you for
If I ever think about you
If I ever call your name
And put my empty arms around you
Let the memory die away
Looking out for a sign
How can I tell what's right
Changing my ways despite myself
If I ran across your picture
If I called you by mistake
And if I ask someone about you
It's a habit I can't break
Looking out for a sign
How can I tell what's right
Changing my ways despite myself
Well if it ain't your time to go
Then you'd better stay put for now
And say you knew me way back when
Well I could hang up my single
Out by the side of the road
And try to bang a flame out of the cinders you left behind
Like a driftwood in the night
That was washed up by the light
Of the moon that bleached my bones
That sent me to the pile
Mustard in your smile
Lend a hand on the radio dial
And the breezes of the seasons
Have blown us back to hell
It's a stolen telephone
That I dialed blind and alone
Just to hear the voice of a bargain center soul
Now the deserts are in flames
And the bandages are the same
And if it ain't your time to go
Then you'd better stay put for now
Upon the hand of the clock
Think I'm brain dead waiting the rain out
In this makeshift mountain home
Making the most of meager means
Necessary evil one more time
If you're stranded out on a warpath
There's no scapegoat for to ride you home
Now that the day is over
I got a new sensation
Now that the night is over
And the sun comes like a God
All perfect light and promises
Of all that's come and going
And you will find out in the end
There really is no difference
When you've got to get it out
I'll be your shoulder
Well that's the reason why I'm here
Are you ready for a new sensation
Gonna take you on a new sensation
When there's nothing left for you
Don't let your pain take over you
It's written all over your face
There's nothing better we could do
Well that's all we've got to do
Hey now I'm gonna take a new sensation
I gotta hold on you a new sensation
Torn out girl on beach black hair black
With black lipstick throwing daggers with her eyes
Beaten down with two by fours
White washed walls of discontent won't repent
Death metal plates for carnival girls
Send her away when she's sick of the sun
Let the sleet and the snow teach her a lesson
The candy ass guards with their fingers all charred
Blaze through the fields
Right down to the foul earth
They bathe to the cabins
With fresh cigarettes
Well I just got put down
In the ashes of an asphalt town
Blows out over the sunken seas
Singing a regular song
They don't bother me at all
I'm loose inside my skin
Shoot out on the traffic lights
On your way to the dead of night
Singing a regular song
They don't notice me at all
Troubles find their own
You're better off alone
Nobody knows the coupon clones
Singing a regular song
Black cards in effigy
We sing the song that was hated
All dressed like vagabonds
Might take a fire to kill it
Might take a hurricane
She lives in broken down buildings
Can't pay the rent again
These spider webs are my home now
And when the sun is down
We'll shake and rattle our bodies
To keep it warm at night
Black cards in effigy
We sing the song that was hated
All dressed like vagabonds
Might take a fire to kill it
Might take a hurricane
If you've got some money to burn
But Satan is waiting his turn
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poorhouse
It seems like this whole town's insane
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain
The scientists say it'll all wash away
But we don't believe it anymore
So please show your ID at the door
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poorhouse
It seems like this whole town's insane
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain
His ideas made some people mad
But they lost the best friend they had
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poorhouse
It seems like this whole town's insane
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain
I like being wrapped with warmness more than anything else for sure
I'm take make my coming days and fill them with laughter and joy
I let myself down by being crueler than I thought I would be
I'm just a loser learning to care for the soul inside of me
I tried to love this loneliness to slip out from where it hides
Sorrow is what I hate but it's grown my sensations
Regrets taught me how to make any hard decisions
Peace is always by my side but I've never felt it once
Love is not a word reserved only for sweet romance
And I'm scared to keep on going on my way
And I'll tell myself I'm special till the end
And all the memories I wanted to forget for making waves
That'll take it all and grin at the future on it's way to me...
Steve had a big commotion
Didn't need no suntan lotion
He was doing fine with what he had
And off his melting jaw
All the wonderful things he saw
And the free hair growing on his sandwich
He looked out on the fairground
With the spinning things spinning all around
And he felt the food going down and coming back
And on top of the ferris wheel
He threw up on the heel
Of the beautiful girl who was laughing
There must have been some pizza
And there must have been some fries
And there must have been some tequila
Must have been some wine.
And there must have been some beer
And there must have been some bagels
You could see it so clear.
And there must have been some pickles
And there must have been some sauerkraut
And there must have been some catfish
When he laid his burden down
I prayed heaven today
Would bring it's hammer down on me
And pound you out of my head
I can't think with you in it
I dragged all that I own
Down a dirt road to find you
And my shoes worn out and used
Put together even though
You know there's something missing
The sun burned a hole in my roof
I can't seem to fix it
And I hope the rain doesn't come
And wash me down the gutter
Put together even though
You know there's something missing
Something always missing
Always someone missing something
Something always missing
Always someone missing something
I can't see her hollow eyes
I'm walking along with my boots full of rocks
I can't believe these tears are mine
I've been drifting along in the same stale old shoes
Loose ends tying a noose in the back of my mind
If you thought that you were making your way
To where the puzzles and pagans lay
When I wake up and someone will sweep up my lazy bones
And we will rise in the cool of the evening
I remember the way that you smiled
When the gravity shackles were wild
Something is vacant when I think it's all beginning
And I've been drifting along in the same stale old shoes
The loose ends tying a noose in the back of my mind
If you thought that you were making your way
To where the puzzles and pagans lay
And it's a strange invitation
And it's a strange invitation
It's a strange invitation
Sunday morning brings the dawn in
It's just a restless feeling by my side
It's just the wasted years not so far behind
There's always someone around you
Sunday morning and I'm falling
I've got a feeling I don't want to know
It's all the streets you crossed not so long ago
There's always someone around you
There's always someone around you
And there's not a friend to help you through
Try and stop the waves behind your eyeballs
Thank you for your sweet and bitter fruit
Yes I got the desert in my toenail
And I hid the speed deep inside my shoe
Got to scrape that shit right off your shoe
Got to scrape that shit right off your shoes
Got to scrape that shit right off your shoes
Space ships can't tame the jungle
And I feel like I'm giving in
Looking for a life to call our own
I push I pull the days go slow
Into a void we filled with death
And noise that laughs falls off their
Maps all cured of pain and doubts
Dogs are howling to themselves
Days are changing with the weather
Like a rip tide could rip us away
I push I pull the days go slow
Into a void we filled with death
And noise that laughs falls off their
Maps all cured of pain and doubts
I rock a beat to make the hamburger fry
And I funk this joint and shake that holiday gear
I turn it out in a holiday mode
Safe like a seatbelt in a Volvo
We'll shut it down harmoniously
I get the shit lit like a menorah
I rock with New Balance
Ejaculating like buffet tables and record labels
Lifestyles of the slick and sleazy
Kinda science that puts ya back into the cradle
Put these rhymes together like a thief
Clear up your nose like a eucalyptus leaf
I do the best I can not to worry about things
I'm running after time and I miss the sunshine
I do the best I can not to worry about things
Like a vagabond in the distance looking for a song to sing
A song that will last all night and for the rest of our lives
I do the best I can not to worry about things
I'm running after time and I miss the sunshine
I do the best I can not to worry about things
I'm running after time and I miss the sunshine
The storms are on the ocean
Searching through the waters
Where you might be low
And I am so downhearted
And I am disappointed
The words will never tell
The storms are on the ocean
The heavens may cease to be
This world may lose its motion
The last time that I saw you
You shook my hand goodbye
You said it wasn't forever
But that was such an old friend
He holds you in his hands
And I am so long waiting
To meet you in that land
The storms are on the ocean
The heavens may cease to be
This world may lose its motion
Add another to the breaker
On a broken escalator
We could get what we need
Honorable mentions get a bouquet of weeds
Like they know what they're undoing
Pushing weight against the wall
Cities in shambles Untangling tangles
This girl that I know
I met her at a Minuteman show
This girl that I know
I met her at a Booker T. Show
Just like a lone dancer
With a chrome ghetto blaster
We just do what we feel
Even if it's atrocious
There's no hope for the hopeless
If there's nothing to cope
We get a rhythm that's real
Like a Tuesday commuter
With a dirty computer
We see the future hanging out
Like cigarettes boring
To a smoker in the morning
Pulling butts from the ground
This girl that I know
I met her at a Sonic Youth show
This girl that I know
Now you're in the danger zone
Yellow turns to black
Now you're in the danger zone
Yellow turns to black
The doctor's on the phone
Now you're in the danger zone
Yellow turns to black
Now you're in the danger zone
Yellow turns to black
Now you're in the danger zone
Now you're in the danger zone
Now you're in the danger zone
Now you're in the danger zone
Your whole crew is whack
We got a warning light
We got a warning light
There's a time bomb ticking
Going tick tick tick tick
There's a time bomb ticking
There's a time bomb ticking
There's a time bomb ticking
Going tick tick tick tick
There's a time bomb ticking
There's a time bomb ticking
Going tick tick tick tick
Riding on an elevator
Cold just like an alligator
Now my baby's out of data
Fighting and lightning
And tightening above the buckles
There's a time bomb ticking
Going tick tick tick tick
There's a time bomb ticking
Put whiskey in the gas tank
Put blood on the wheels
I gotta jar of tobacco
And I'm down with the deal
Well I know that I'm loaded
I gotta make it to Texas
To see that woman of mine
Well my face is all bloodshot
There's a stain on my shirt
If I don't make it to Fort Worth
Someone's bound to get hurt
Well I know I'm loaded
Gotta make it to Texas
To see that woman of mine
Well I blew out the engine
And I got on the school bus
Yeah I know that I'm loaded
I gotta make it to Texas
True love will find you in the end
You'll find out just who was your friend
But don't give up until
True love will find you in the end
This is a promise with a catch
Only if you're looking will it find you
Unless you step out into the light
True love finds you in the end
True love will find you in the end
You'll find out just who was your friend
And don't give up until
True love finds you in the end
True love will find you in the end
I just let my twig fly in the wind
You know it's like the branch broken
I let my twig burn in the wind
It's like a twig... it's like a stick
I let it fly in the wind
And I let my twig fly in the wind...
Some weepy creepy willow pillow boggy shit
Transcendental big wheel can you feel it
Drink a cup of dirty water and a load of bony frog
Slip me seven dollars and I'll pump it full of smog
Paint a monkey gold and let it loose downtown
Start him with a smile and he come back with a frown
He's just a twig in the wind
Tape recorded all distorted genius machine
Dusty busty skeletons who pay at the pump
I'm shoulder high in crap and my water wings are flat
I'm just a twig in the wind...
Ecstasy... next to me. the future
Is bright... your pants are so tight. tantalize.
Well if it ain't your time to go
Then you'd better stay put for now
And say you knew me way back when
And all rest were swine waiting to be defiled
Well I could hang up my shingle
Out by the side of the road
And try to bang a flame out of the cinders you left behind
Like a driftwood in the night
That was washed up by the light
Of the moon that bleached my bones
That sent me to the pile
Mustard in your smile
Land a hand on the radio dial
And the breezes of the season
Have blown us back to hell
It's a stolen telephone
That I dialed blind and alone
Just to hear the voice of a bargain center soul
Now the deserts are inflamed
And the bandages are the same
And if it ain't your time to go
Then you'd better stay put for now
Upon the hand of the clock
Baby I can't make it straight
My boots got stuck and I can't wait
You're the one who's got no tongue
Look and see which way it's run
Obituaries I seen right through
Brochures of the times we knew
Taxes on the days we spent
Repossessed and named and chained
Sticks and stones and lesser knowns
And all your hopes can be derailed
No dreams in the night you lie
All the stars stripped from the sky
In the ashes of a backwash town
Blows out over the sunken seas
It's a state where I belong
I'm loose inside my skin
Shoot out all the traffic lights
On your way to the dead of night
They don't bother me at all
You're better off alone
I don't know what I want but I know
All the fingers creeping under my bones
And I know that it's time to go
But it's time that's got its teeth in me
And I want you to fix your eyes
On something that could be beautiful
If you could teach me to lose my soul
It's just one percent of what I know
Vampire voltage in my soul
Straight down out of the world with my fingers
All my troubles just hang on your trigger
Take your eyes and your mind from the road
Don't forget to pick up what you sow
Broke down out in a ditch of old rubbish
Snakes and bones in the back of your room
Heaven's drunk the poison you use
Charm the wolves with the eyes of a gambler
Now I see it's a comfort to you
Hammer my bones on the anvil of daylight
I won't give up that ghost
It's sick the way these tongues are twisted
There's too much left to taste that's bitter
I won't give up that ghost
It's sick the way these tongues are twisted
And the show was whimsical and sublime
Till I grasp a big disaster like a mime
With an apple and a mango and some wine
With decorations all around
He was sniffing the cube like a hound
All right here's a stupid song I wrote today
Yeah this is probably the first and last time you'll hear this one...
Take out your whiskey bottle there
Now you don't even move out of your chair
Your getting juiced up beyond belief
I can barely love you when your getting drunk all the time
And I shut my mouth before I even breathe
Well you're gonna give me a xerox of your buckteeth...
By the lane with my hands in my pocket
On the bathroom wall where my number is written
By the lane with my hands in my pocket
And my heart is set on you
To my heart I must be true
You're the one that I want oh
You're the one that I want oh
You need a man who can keep you satisfied
I better shape up if you need a man
You're the one that I want oh
You're the one that I want oh
There's a story in our town
Of the prettiest girl around
Golden hair and eyes of blue
But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store
She was tops in all they said
It never once went to her head
She had everything it seems
Other boys could offer more
But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store
He would marry her next spring
Then one day a movie scout
Hollywood could offer more
So she left the boy next door working at the candy store
Very soon she was a star
Pretty house and shiny car
Swimming pool and a fence around
All the world was at her door
All except the boy next door who worked at the candy store
Then one day the teenage star
Sold her house and all her cars
Gave up all her wealth and fame
Do I have to tell you more
She came back to the boy next door who worked at the candy store
He stood six foot six and weighed two forty five
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew ya didn't give no lip to Big John.
Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John
Now they never reopened that worthless pit
They just placed a marble stand in front of it
These few words are written on that stand
At the bottom of this mine lies one hell of a man big john
For the weather station
A little bit North of Nome
And I grew up in that frozen country
Where the nights are six months long
I used to play like I was an Eskimo
I put whale oil on my hair
And every night I would beg my folks
Let me sleep in the frigid air
I was seventeen and my voice was changing
But the girls didn't thrill me none
On the banks of the old Yukon
One night I slipped from my daddy's house
A little bit north of Nome
I knew that I could get back by morning
Sitting on a chunk of ice
Which means the love in my heart
You're melting the ice
I went back home and I told my daddy
About this maiden fair
And how I felt I'd love to melt
Them icicles in her hair
Dad's trembling lips turned purple
And his breath began to freeze
It was then he told me
I could never rub noses
The Eskimos always brought the ice
He stole my little boy and made
So I stole you to get even
Just like the cold blooded
Little Eskimo that you are
Has the coldest nose in Alaska
Well it happened that the PTA was gonna meet that very afternoon.
She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA.
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep her window shades a pulled completely down.
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin.
It was late don't know the hour
Heard the sirens away across town
Looked out my door my house burned down
The neighbors seeing what they could see
I hung my britches upon a limb
Some girls came by you know what they done
They took my clothes away they run
My girl friend called said come around
Cause my husband's out of town
Please notify my next of kin
Dodging bullets from tree to tree
Like my arms and my hands and the skin on my fingers Are somebody else's not mine.
I can't help but wonder.
On the tip of my tongue.
If you feel like I feel.
If you feel like I feel.
To give my heart to you.
To every prayer I've prayed.
I know there's a chance we could make it.
Chances are good that I'll take it.
To give my life to you.
And I could be persuaded.
And you know that you've been gone a little bit too long
There's no easy way to say how wrong I was.
Sometimes we start over right where we began.
All the leaves falling down Just like they are now as I stare out my window.
Now if only my broken heart knew.
All the memories neatly penned on the pages of the journal
So I said I had to have him.
I didn't want him much at all.
The trouble with love.
Said we couldn't be more than friends.
There I was in trouble again.
The trouble with love.
Or just can't get enough.
That's the trouble with love.
Gonna step out on my own.
The trouble with love.
The trouble with love.
Or just can't get enough.
That's the trouble with love.
The trouble with love.
I feel the jagged edge of a broken heart.
I feel the jagged edge of a broken heart.
And every night's another shade of blue.
I feel the jagged edge of a broken heart.
I feel the jagged edge of a broken heart.
I feel the jagged edge of a broken heart.
Here with the two of us and only this love only this precious love
The answer's somewhere above
We'll always be in this love
The answer's somewhere above
We'll always be in this love
And I'm not afraid to say I need you.
But I don't think that it's too much to ask.
I'm standing on top of a mountain high
Beauty of the land stands lies before my eyes
But what's the land to me or colors of the sky
I woke up before dawn I tossed and turned all night
Without the one I love I can no longer stay
I followed moon and sun my heart and shining stars
And I won't stop until I'm safe in my lover's arms
At the sunset of the day.
I've been ready to say it for awhile
You know I'm not impulsive
It's not a change of heart
We've grown so far apart
You shouldn't be surprised
Already passed the point of no return
And that will be the last bridge to burn
It's time that our lives go separate ways
It's time for our love to call it a day
Just imagine a world where hearts don't break
And goodbye was a word no one would say
Just imagine a night with me back in your arms
Where the light of tomorrow outshines the dark
Just imagine a clock whose hands would reverse
Where you pull in the drive when the work day is through
And I'm waiting there like I used to do
Just imagine a home where we live and we laugh
Just imagine how clearly I see through these tears
How badly I miss you and wish you were here
Yesterday's wars stack up like old papers on the floor
Pounding like old knocks upon my door
Changing this old mountain into sand
You know me by the stories I have made
You know me by looking out through boxes and cages
And it's hard to clearly see what's right in ordinary light
Does the truth filter down through the ages
We cannot see the end so here we must begin
You know me by the stories I have made
You know me by looking out through boxes and cages
And it's hard to clearly see what's right in ordinary light
Does the truth filter down through the ages
We cannot see the end so here we must begin
Down through history we race across
Borders into empty space we write
Another heart may follow
You know me by the stories I have made
You know me by looking out through boxes and cages
And it's hard to clearly see what's right in ordinary light
Does the truth filter down through the ages
We cannot see the end so here we must begin
You make me happy with the things you do
This feeling follows me wherever I go
I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why
It would be different and you that it will
I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why
I say I could walk a thousand miles just to get away
He doesn't care about my pain
He's got the keys to every door in my soul
That's why I'm here when he's gone
It can't get any worse means I'm gonna be okay
And you won't read any word of this story
He doesn't care about my pain
He's got the keys to every door in my soul
Can't explain why I need you
Lie to myself that I can reach you
Don't wanna believe all the stories
They're telling about you
I'm punished for nothing
He doesn't care about my pain
He's got the keys to every door in my soul
That's why I'm here when he's gone
Sometimes I think I'm well on my way
Sometimes I think that I did okay
Bu every time that you come around
My whole world turns upside down
And it hurts just a little
Tear's gonna fall if I'm not careful
It hurts just a little
I used to think when I turned out the lights
I'd find peace in the dark of the night
And I found out just what it means
To hurt just a little
Tear's gonna fall if I'm not careful
It hurts just a little
Every time you come around
My whole world turns upside down
It hurts just a little
Tear's gonna fall if I'm not careful
It hurts just a little
Tear's gonna fall if I'm not careful
It hurts just a little
I was swinging on the swings when I was a little girl
When I noticed all the grass in the cracks in the concrete
Given the slightest chance
For the week and the strong
There was a third grade boy that we knew in school
He was found face down in a swimming pool
And as they worked on that kid every minute was an hour
And when his eyes fluttered open we could feel that power
Given the slightest chance
For the week and the strong
Sirens screaming down my street
Whining somewhere far away
To someone I don't know
Through the window in the kitchen I can see outside
My kids taking turns coming down the slide
I try not to worry as they grow a little every day
I've just got believe they're gonna find their way
Given the slightest chance
For the week and the strong
Fingers press the keys for interface
The printer taps the words across the page
We have gotten men upon the moon
And babies from a spoon
In this high tech finely tuned computer age
But we've got no system
There's this vast land of resources
That won't apply to rules
We've got these prehistoric tools...
These hearts inside of us
But we've got no system for love
Satellites twist pictures home to Earth
We've got the airwaves in control
We've got a record of each soul from date of birth
But we've got no system
There are temples and steeples
And billions of people
And so much potential
We haven't even touched
Seems like after all we've been through
We would have learned by now
Never to fight for gets the last word
It doesn't matter anyhow
Trying to work things through
And sometimes it feels like miles between us
But I keep coming back to you
And it's harder than anything I've ever tried to do
But I love you so much that in spite of the struggle
I keep coming back to you
That we have shared so long
We've studied that map of cracks on the ceiling
Talking till the break of dawn
There is something strong as history
Telling me this love is true
So I keep coming back to you
And it's harder than anything I've ever tried to do
But I love you so much that in spite of the struggle
Thought I'd wrapped up the case
I went and promised my heart
But you just laughed in my face
Never thought I'd forget you
But I've got no regret
So if by chance you walk my way
And feel the joy and pain of yesterday
You'll never need a reason to pretend
A simple smile is all I ask
The smile you hide behind your painted mask
Somewhere between a stranger and a friend
When you want someone so
I put my heart on the line
So if by chance you walk my way
And feel the joy and pain of yesterday
You'll never need a reason to pretend
A simple smile is all I ask
The smile you hide behind your painted mask
Somewhere between a stranger and a friend
So if by chance you walk my way
And feel the joy and pain of yesterday
You'll never need a reason to pretend
A simple smile is all I ask
The smile you hide behind your painted mask
Somewhere between a stranger and a friend
You can say you love me
And I'll believe that's true
There is nothing I would miss
As long as we're in love like this
All I have is all I need
And it all comes down to you and me
How far away this world becomes
In the harbor of each others arms
I feel like I've known you forever and ever
Baby that's how close we are
Right here with you is where my life has come together
And where love has filled my heart
You know I'd go anywhere
As long as I have you to care
All I have is all I need
And it all comes down to you and me
How far away this world becomes
In the harbor of each others arms
I never want for anything
I found what I've been searching for in you
All I have is all I need
And it all comes down to you and me
How far away this world becomes
She's wheeled into the hallway
Till the sun moves down the floor
Little squares of daylight
Like a hundred times before
She's taken to the garden
For the later afternoon
Just before her dinner
They return her to her room
She is running in the summer wind
She is running in the summer wind
The family comes on Sunday
And they hover for awhile
They fill her room with chatter
And they form a line of smiles
Children of her children
Bringing babies of their own
Sometimes she remembers
Then her mama calls her home
She is running in the summer wind
She is running in the summer wind
And bring your dollies three
Climb up my apple tree
Slide down my rain barrel
And we'll be jolly friends
She is running in the summer wind
Rita's out on the street tonight
Driving through the rain
She's got lots of new reasons not to trust any man again
And even though she'll be alright
She'll never be the same again
Sometimes you've only got one road and it's a rocky ride
Sometimes there isn't time to think about the tears you've cried
You take it as it comes
When you've got no way to hide from the hurting inside
When there's nowhere you can really run
You take it as it comes
Rita's out on the street tonight
Midnight feels so strange
She's got her baby in the car seat
Her sleeping face flashing as the signals change
They roll up to the corner for the seventh time
As they circle around the square
The movie crowd is spilling out across the street
Rita sits at that light and stares
And she wonders if there's any reason in the world to try
And she glances at her little girl and she remembers why
You take it as it comes
When you've got no way to hide from the hurting inside
When there's nowhere you can really run
You take it as it comes
And one foot goes in front of the other
And one day rolls into the next
Sometimes you've got to let your heart be numb
And take it as it comes
You take it as it comes
When you've got no way to hide from the hurting inside
When there's nowhere you can really run
Sometimes you wonder how much I care
I get so distracted running nowhere
And I take for granted our love is secure
I'd be down on my knees
I'd be begging you please
Don't take your love from me
I'd be down on my knees
I learned to be strong a long time ago
And I can face any wind no matter how hard it blows
But I'd have to be stronger than I want to be
If I had to live without you loving me
I'd be down on my knees
I'd be begging you please
Don't take your love from me
I'd be down on my knees
No one matters more in my life
Or makes me feel like you make me feel inside
And I've come far enough to know
Love's worth never letting go of
And love is not a matter of pride
I'd be down on my knees
I'd be begging you please
Don't take your love from me
I wasn't ready for the avalanche
When we let things slide
I'd always hoped that we would have the chance
At least to say we tried
So I went sifting though my old mistakes
And I decided to forgive myself
The heart can only take so much regret
You're all I'm aching for
I don't want this pain no more
My heart won't lock that door
I wasn't ready for the avalanche
I wasn't ready for the words you chose
When you said goodbye
Or just how suddenly the roads could close
Between your life and mine
So I went looking for the reasons why
And I decided I would have to try
To live without your love at any cost
You're all I'm aching for
I don't want this pain no more
My heart to lock that door
The curtains on my window dark and drawn
To hide my broken heart
Dances on my window ledge
When it's time to face the world again
In the desert of the afternoon
I like what you've done to your hair
That must be your little girl there
Some friendships grow distant with time
But a closeness between us remains
Best friends are made through smiles and tears
And sometimes that fades over miles and years
But I knew right away when I saw you again
I still sing now and then
Mostly at weddings for friends
And I just bet you still get
A yearning to paint now and then
They tore down our whole street
Now there's a bank where the house was we shared back in school
Remember we both have each other to thank
For all the boyfriends we're not married to
Best friends are made through smiles and tears
And sometimes that fades over miles and years
But I knew right away when I saw you again
You signed my yearbook
And they said not to let you get tired
We'll just be up the street
The number's right here by your side
Oh no it's no trouble
I don't want to hear how all this changes my plans
I'll see you tomorrow
Best friends are made through smiles and tears
And sometimes that fades over miles and years
But I knew right away when I saw you again
I went home for Christmas
To the house that I grew up in
Going back was something after all these years
I drove down Monterey Street
And felt a little sadness
When I turned left on Laurel and the house appeared
And I stared out past the shade tree
That my laughing daddy planted on the day that I was born
And I let time go by so slow
And I made every moment last
And I thought about years
How they take so long
Her two boys built a snowman by the backyard swings
And his Christmas decorations
And I thought of all the summers
That I paced that porch and swore I'd die of boredom there
And I thought of what I'd give to feel another summer linger
Where a day feels like a year
And I let time go by so slow
And I made every moment last
And I thought about years
How they take so long
With a thirst for love
This mirror in my soul
Like every other child I've been
Jaded from the outside in
All I've got is feelings
I came tumbling through my mother
To this world of different meanings
It comes down to believing
And I'm looking for someone
Who has a picture of the answer
Spending my existence
Trying to make it all make sense
All I've got is feelings
I came tumbling through my mother
To this world of different meanings
It comes down to believing
And I'm looking for someone
Who has a picture of the answer
All I got is feelings
I came tumbling through my mother
To this world of different meanings
It comes down to believing
And I'm looking for someone
One moment in the wink of an eye
There was nothing I could say
This strong feeling started up inside
I knew time would not erase away
I believe deep down in my soul
You hold the key to holding me
All I know is what I feel
I never play those games of mystery
Feelings come and feelings go
In a world where yes means yes and no
You hold the key to holding me
It's so easy to believe someone
When they tell you what you want to hear
I've trusted words that turned to clouds of smoke
As they faded in the atmosphere
Those words don't come so easily
I wonder if you even know
You hold the key to holding me
I believe deep down in my soul
You hold the key to holding me
You feel you can only trust yourself
I've come across that desert
So sure I was never gonna find your love
I believe deep down in my soul
While the band plays low
Till the night is through
The lights of the candles
Look like stars around the room
I'll try to be careful
But I know I'm not immune
How I'd ever come to harm
With this feeling that I'm feeling
As I'm drowning in your arms
Let that crowd rock and roll
While we share this groove
And float like two shadows
In and out and in between
Those faces around us
At the edges of this dream
And it won't even matter
If they stare as we go by
I'm aware of only your love
In this world of you and I
And love can be too kind
The truth may find you
Running from the way you feel inside
Everything your heart would say
If all the walls came down
Even if the truth tears us apart
I need to feel the closeness
Of knowing what's in your heart
Eyes are like windows
And stay a million miles away from me
Everything your heart would say
If all the walls came down
Even if the truth tears us apart
I need to feel the closeness
Doesn't matter what I say
There are no words good enough
My whole world is your love
Let's erase the doors and windows
There is nothing more I'll ever want outside this room...
You can find out anything about me
I know I could never be without you by my side
Let's erase the doors and windows
Slow these moments down
You're the only one I want around
Let's erase the doors and windows
You're the one my dreams are all about
This is the last time
First he starts drinking
He don't like her thinking
Turn back the page and see
All that was done to me
He brings her flowers
She hangs the pictures
The one of the wedding
There are only so many tears you can cry
Till your heart stops breaking
Only so many doors you can try
Till you finally find your way
The sun reappears in the blink of an eye
And there's only so many tears you can cry
There are only so many reasons to give up
You're not even close
You've got to believe in the power of love
That's all anyone knows
And what makes you strong
And as far as weather and woes
Buckets of rain can fall from the sky
But there's only so many tears you can cry
Forget about who's wrong or right
Come out and dance with me tonight
In the time it takes to tell you
In the time it takes to wonder
Everything inside my heart
Waiting for this dance to start
All you gotta do is let go...
In the time it takes to want me
And you'd never have to ask how much I care
Love for me is not some game
Any time you call my name
Like a star that's traveled years to shine
Like a song that wants to hear the rhyme
Like a spark that makes your soul ignite
Only love knows when the moments right
Nothing I wouldn't give
Knowing I couldn't live without you
Heavens gonna help me
You make me promises that you don't keep.
You tell me one thing then do something else.
I keep expecting you to change.
It's give and take a little that's the key.
There seems to be a pattern here.
How can I tell if you're sincere
I keep expecting you to change.
I remember thinking love was a fool's game
Break your heart you've got your own self to blame
From the moment you were mine
People fall in love and swear they are so sure
Then they turn around and say it's over
I never trusted love to come any closer
Till the moment you were mine
And I knew why I had waited so long
One look in your eyes
Meant forever from that moment on
I used to dream somebody's arms were around me
Wake up all alone and feel so empty
No I never dreamed how real love could be
Till the moment you were mine
And I knew why I had waited so long
One look in your eyes
Meant forever from that moment on
I used to dream somebody's arms were around me
Wake up all alone and feel so empty
No I never dreamed how real love could be
Till the moment you were mine
What more can one life ask
One hand to hold along life's path
Share with me this vow
Our souls will be entwined
No greater joy is mine
For each of us bequeath a faithful heart
No greater joy is mine
Fast asleep in the dawn of ages
The soul of every child
Has waited to be born a stranger
Underneath the drum of his mothers heart
Lying deep in a dream of darkness
Where fear has never gone
Each spark of a life is started
Blind and pure to the world we come
Blind and pure to the world we come
Each of us a dancer to the drum
Each of us a dancer to the drum
Blind and pure we come
One is born into a life of hunger
One will be a king or a rich man's son
One will kill out of greed or anger
One will give his life for another one
There are smiles in the lies of innocence
There are blooms in the walls of stone
And we will see ourselves
In the eyes of everyone we have ever known
Everyone we have ever known
Through the days that we have on earth
Each of us a dancer to the drum
Each of us a dancer to the drum
Blind and pure we come
Fast asleep in the dawn of ages
The soul of every child
Has waited to be born a stranger
I held you close to me
Once in a distant dream
Far from the shores of my fear
I sailed on this ocean
Where all I imagined could happen
It's so hard to touch what is out of our hands
To know and to trust what the heart understands
Only the ones who believe
Ever see what they dream
Ever dream what comes true
And life brings us tragedy
Everyone suffers some loss
Still we have faith in it
There's a reason that outweighs the cost
And gravity throws all these rules in our way
And sometimes the spirit refuses to play
Only the ones who believe
Ever see what they dream
Ever dream what comes true
Turn me around in your arms
And in this dream we share
Let us not miss one kiss
And add my regrets to the tears in the rain
That's what the color of roses contain
Only the ones who believe
Ever see what they dream
One star belongs to you
And every breath I take
I'm closer to that place
I'm gonna meet you there
On the outskirts of the sky
I'm gonna meet you there
One star belongs to you
This life is but a dream
Go gently down the stream...
There's a woman in a wool suit
Coming through the bank doors
Late for some appointment
Now she rushes to the front desk
And she talks to the receptionist
Who motions to the telephone
Over in the waiting room
She's calling someone
But I can't see much from where I sit
There goes the diaper bag
The baby's slipping on her hip
Before my car moves up an inch
They both have started crying
All the time in the world
It goes flying out the window
All the time in the world...
These precious days we live through
Thrown away like tissue
I wish that I could give you all the time in the world
Dresses on a clothesline
Dancing in a heat wave
Browning in the car fumes
Blowing off the interstate
Glancing down the cornrows
Dreaming in a straight line
And did I say I've got the right to want it all
Well if it's true I want it all
How could that do me any harm
I'll jump the ditches
All alone I didn't like the feeling
All alone I sat and cried
All alone I had to find some meaning
In the center of the pain I felt inside
All alone I came into this world
All alone I will someday die
I will see you in the light of a thousand suns
I will hear you in the sound of the waves
Through the doors beyond the grave
All alone I heal this heart of sorrow
All alone I raise this child
Bursting towards tomorrow
And his laughter fills my world and wears your smile
I will see you in the light of a thousand suns
I will hear you in the sound of the waves
Through the doors beyond the grave
All alone I came into this world
All alone I will someday die
There's nothing more to say
You closed the door today
You chose to walk away
You won't see the tears I cry
Let's keep this cut and dry
Words won't make you change your mind
I took a chance to love you
You broke my heart this time
This lesson I have learned
Someday the tides will turn
And if my love can't stop you
Words won't make you change your mind
I took a chance to love you
You broke my heart this time
Someone leaves someone stays
Someone lost but who's to say
You risk it all to walk away
The sun will shine again
Somehow my heart will mend
And if my love can't stop you
Words won't make you change your mind
I took a chance to love you
You broke my heart this time
I want to hold you now
And listen to you breathe
It's like the ocean sound
Whispering through the trees
In the hollow of your shoulder
There's a tide pool of my tears
Where the waves came crashing over
And the shoreline disappears
Fly back there with me
Where the phosphor shines
Green flashlights from the sea
Our nets were full of soft shells
Our hearts were free from toil
And we made love on the kitchen table
Till the water reached a boil
Like little knives upon our tongue
We can do no wrong when the lights come on
And we take the stage like we own the place
As if time were cheap and the night forever young
And with the ocean's roll
And the birds will sing my laughter
And the whales will steal my song
I used to live in a darkened room
Had a face of stone and a heart of gloom
Crying all my tears with the curtains drawn
I didn't know until my soul broke free
I've got these angels watching over me
That the sweetest thing that you've ever seen
In the whole wide world Is a happy girl
I used to hide in a party crowd
Standing in the corner wearing concrete shoes
With my frozen smile and my lighted fuse
Now every time I start to feel like that
I roll my heart out like a welcome mat
That the sweetest thing that you've ever seen
In the whole wide world Is a happy girl
Laugh when I feel like it
Cry when I feel like it
That's just how my life is
I'm the happy girl and I've come to know
Let the axis twirl I'm the happy girl
I can almost feel you smiling
From beyond those silver skies
As you watch me finding my way
Here without you in my life
I've come so close to believing
All the echoes in the wind
Brushing my hair off my shoulders
I feel you there once again
And if there is some magic
Some way around these stars
Some road that I can travel
To get to where you are
I'll cry this empty canyon
An ocean full of tears
And I won't stop believing
That your love is always near
Hey baby it's a mean old world
Gotta keep your feet on the ground
Gotta have a heart like Jesus
Trust what's inside you
And heads up for the wrecking ball
Hey baby it's a backseat ride
Nothing but your hope at the wheel
So you want to be a true believer
You can't pretend what your soul don't feel
Good luck will guide you
And heads up for the wrecking ball
High on a shelf inside myself I go
One day we'll all fly home...
Hey baby it's a mean old world
Gotta keep your feet on the ground
You gotta have a heart like Jesus
Trust what's inside you
And heads up for the wrecking ball
Heads up for the wrecking ball
You will never leave my heart behind
Like the path of a star
I'll be anywhere you are
In the spark that lies beneath the coals
In the secret place inside your soul
Keep my light in your eyes
Don't you fear when you dream
Waking up is never what it seems
Like a jewel buried deep
Like a promise meant to keep
You are everything you want to be
So just let your heart reach out to me
I'll be right by your side
You are everything you want to be
So just let your heart reach out to me
Keep my light in your eyes
Gave us all the wisdom of a new born child
But by the time we take our first step
We've already begun to forget
What the heart knows the heart sees
We're just as much the forest as we are the trees
Every little seed trying to find
Where the light comes from
And it's a world of hurt
It's a lonely little planet made of dust and dirt
Something as beautiful as love exists
And when I hold you and you hold me
Heaven doesn't seem like such a mystery
Darling in a world of hurt
You make me feel so good
Two heartbroken people scared to trust too much
What every lover swears will never end
We knew we'd never been her...
We've never done this
When you love someone
And it's a world of hurt
It's a lonely little planet made of dust and dirt
Something as beautiful as love exists
And when I hold you and you hold me
Heaven doesn't seem like such a mystery
Darling in a world of hurt
I dropped a coin in a wishing well
I turned the wild jack over
Listened to the devil tell
Cross my heart I hope to live
Tangled with my lover
Opening my sorrows gifts
Still the light will pierce the dark
Still the dark will steal the light
And everything will be all right
Though change won't be denied
All these ways god loves me so
In languages I've come to know
Bended trees with melting snow
And angels by my side
The troubles of this world release
And the promise of tomorrow keeps
Still the light will pierce the dark
And the dark will steal the light
And grace provides these
Must lose its faith in leaves
And dream of the spring inside the trees.
How light the heart that's full.
Sometimes I have to trust what I can't know
Sometimes I have to trust what I can't know
The angels lend us shoes.
And Heaven is not so far
Outside this womb of words.
With every rose that blooms
It's just like a song I've known
Melting in the arms of earth and snow.
You'd enter like a sigh.
You'd be the wind that blows
I had it all lined up
Then my future crashed
I heard the deadbolt lock
And there stood my past
But there are no signs for tomorrow
On the back roads of my sorrow
But the grace will have to come to me
I'm gonna shake my soul
And let the rest unfold
Take off the training wheels
Lift off the handle bars
I'll drive right through my fears
And resurrect my heart
And even in my darkest hour
I know it one way or another
Love is coming back around to me
I'm gonna shake my soul
And let the rest unfold
In the face that I wore as a child
And the rain comes I can hear it
Like a bass drum loud and clear it's
Ancient wisdom of the spirit
I'm gonna shake my soul
And let the rest unfold
All my traveling time
Running circles around my dreams
Our love's not what it seems
Now my soul keeps calling for a long lost day
And a love that I held so true
Well there's no use following the heartache
Through the valley of my shadow of doubt
Through the winter of my discontent
And when it seems like all my hope is spent
There's only one prayer I pray... wait for the way
Each small step of my life
There's a loneliness I've known
I take the road that's right
Even if I'm left alone
But I know that heaven holds amazing grace
When you trust what you feel inside
And a true heart opens at it's own pace
Through the valley of my shadow of doubt
Through the winter of my discontent
And when it seems like all my hope is spent
There's only one prayer I pray... wait for the way
Now my soul keeps calling for a long lost day
And a love that I held so true
Though there's no use falling for the heartache
Through the valley of my shadow of doubt
Through the winter of my discontent
And when it seems like all my hope is spent
Straight shot of misery
Some days make a mess of me
I touch the ground when I can find my feet
You know it all comes down to love
I tell myself I can do it all
Sometimes it feels my life's impossible
But then it all comes down to
I'd love to take you on a time machine
Fill those cracks things fall between
So we could find more days to fly away from the hurricane
But in the ebb and flow
It all comes down to love
I turn around and he's six feet high
And as I let him go and
I know it all comes down to love
I light the candles and I'll cut the cake
Make a wish for every heart that breaks
Sweet forgiveness never made a mistake
You know it all comes down to
I could love you till my heart's content
I know you must be Heaven sent
The way you sweep me up in your arms in the middle of an argument
It all comes down to love
Take you down to guts and the rubble
That it all comes down to
You know it all comes down to love
You know it all comes down to love
You know it all comes down to love
In the tears you gave to me
I found a river to an ocean
A concrete sky and a stone cold sea
I came to wear the emptiness
All my fears came crashing through
And met the fire of my sorrow
But I found my strength
How far my heart could go
To give my life beyond each death
From a deeper well of trust
To know when there's nothing left
You will always have what you gave to love
In this life the love you give
What you lose will be what you win
A well the echoes down to deep to measure
A silver coin rings down that well
You can never spend too much
A diamond echoes deeper still...
And you will always have
What you gave to love
And you will always have
And sleep I think to myself
Beating fiercely against the wind
Or lying there with broken hands
Wondrous wings and blinded eyes
That see even beyond seeing
The same unspeakable loveliness
How beautiful and sad
And peace I think to myself
Each and everyone alone
Reaching out form endless dreams
With open hearts and fragile souls
Like children always seeking home
Where love is as easy as breathing
And breath is as light
How frightening and sweet it is
The same unspeakable loveliness
How beautiful and sad it is
And sleep I think to myself
For all of us for all of us
Sleep I think at last
The sound of my heart is ancient and true
And it sings like a thousand bells
I try to believe wherever you are
There's a sky and a sea of blue
And someone you trust
Whose sheltering arms
Have finally comforted you
The touch of you hand still lives in my skin
Like a shadow I can't embrace
Wherever it ends is where it begins
Without ever leaving a trace
So you live in me and I live in you
And the rest is for love to tell
The wind blowing through
All for the love we want
All for the love we need
Deep in the lonely heart
Winter holds the seed
Reach till you know how far
Trust till you know how true
Give till you know how much
For this we shed our skin
Feel where each breath begins
Bleed as we pick the rose
Fall back with both eyes closed
All for the love we want
All for the love we want
For this we shed our skin
Feel where each breath begins
Bleed as we pick the rose
Fall back with both eyes closed
All for the love we want
All for the love we want
And the black of the night cannot harm us
We can trust not to fear for our comfort is near
It will rain it will rain in the desert
In the cracks of the plain there's a treasure
It will rain it will rain in the desert
We will fly we will fly we will let go
To this world we will die but our hearts know
We'll see more on that side when the door opens wide
We will fly we will fly we will fly we will fly
Draw through my heart
My soul keeps calling
Right here inside each
How worthy to possess my heart's devoted love
My heart has overflowed this joy within my breast
Deep in the sweet abyss of holy charity
O loveliness supreme and beauty shining bright
O ever flowing stream and ocean of delight
To thee alone I give my undivided love
For thou can't hear amid the wild
We slumbers safely tear the Mother
Though we be man outcast relived
The murky cavern's air so heavy
Shall breath of balm if thou hast smiled
I blew out all my plans
The world fell in my hands
The secrets I have kept
The nights I haven't slept
I've laughed until I've wept
Trying to love you... No one's come as close or gone so far
Trying to love you... I've lost and found myself in who you are
I've watched myself get stuck
Squandered all my luck
Trying to love you... I've crossed the great divide trying to love you
Trying to love you... I've worn a million miles across the floor
Trying to love you... Still I could not ignore trying to love you
It's pulled the best from me
For all the world to see
I've tried to keep my two feet on the ground
You've got my nights and days all turned around
Waited for it... sweet surrender
Waited for it... endless charm
Waited for it... every moment spent in your arms
Sends me right back into the feeling
When the world melts under your touch
And you toss my heart through the ceiling
No reason not to fall in love
Love I've lost came at so high a cost
Thought I'll be better off just on my own
Then we kissed and all the fun I'd missed
Felt like a thousand ships turning for home
Waited for it... I'd almost given up
Waited for it... believing you would come
Waited for it... every time I think I should run
You send me right back into the feeling
Where the world melts under your touch
And you toss my heart through the ceiling
No reason not to fall in love
I try to think about the consequences
Second guessing with a backward glance
But my brain doesn't stand a chance
Look at how your love has changed my life
Woke up all the dreams I've held inside
All the stars fell in place
When you first touched my face
And once again the world felt right
Look at how you knew you'd found my heart
Deep out of the blue and torn apart
Long before I could see you were so meant for me
You held me in your arms so tight
Through time and grace
How sweet to step into this dance
When I never thought my heart
Would get a second chance
Look at how your love has changed my life
Filled me with a hope that shines so bright
That the past closed the book
When I turned back to look
I had it tough when I was just a little kid
It didn't matter what I thought it didn't matter what I did
I felt the doubt for what I lacked right from the start
It did a number on my head but it could never touch my heart
Just enough to keep the faith
That somehow I would think of what to do
When I'd get lost in a momentary weakness of emotion
All the angels came around to help me through
Life pulls fast changes
Wind blows past pages
Ticking time bomb clocks
I'm free... Kicking out of that prison
I'm free... Singing those words of wisdom
Let it be... Nobody's gonna put the blues inside of me...
And in the stress to be the best I've done it all
I've slammed the doors I've jammed the locks
No one could tell me back then why joy eluded me
Kept bumping into that misery locked up deep down inside of me
Turned that page and I
And I've passed my graduation
I hold my Ph. D. in crash test blues
I'm free... Kicking out of that prison
I'm free... Singing those words of wisdom
Let it be... Nobody's gonna put the blues inside of me...
Time flies by in photographs
And paper scraps and songs
Here I stand in ruby slippers
There are songs I love that catch my breath
When the first chord starts to play
You would always touch my heart that way
And it hurts so much to let you go
And there are no words to say
But the corner of your smile says all I need to know
You could always touch my heart that way
Go on and show all those stars what it means to shine
Like a fire that spins inside a spark
You will always touch my heart that way
Go on and show all those stars what it means to shine
And I know your love is here with me
I can feel you every day
Even if the beauty of your face I cannot see
Only you could touch my heart that way
I can't believe that after all this time
You keep slipping back across my mind
Did we maybe leave a love behind
Afraid of what we felt
Other loves I've had have come and gone
I don't know why they just don't last too long
There are questions that go on and on
Time won't tell me how it might have been
Time won't make what's wrong alright
It can only take me back again
I watch us kiss goodbye that day
Here's where you turned around and walked away
What were the words that would have made you stay
Other loves I've had have come and gone
I don't know why they just don't last too long
There are questions that go on and on
You never see the road you didn't take
You never feel the love you fail to make
To never know may be the worst mistake
Cause time won't tell
She's used her pain to build a concrete wall
But that's not who she is
She's rolled her angry words into a fist
That's not who she is
I slammed the phone down hard and walked outside
I wrote her off that day as if she'd died
Lost behind the masks we wear
The barbed wire fences of our fear
We drag each other through these tears
And strike the wounds that scar
But that's not who we are
That's not who we are
That time and grace will roll the stone away
And we'll love each other with open hearts
A mother who gave all she could
A child who tried to just be good
We reach and fall so far
In father brother sisterhood
Like dust of ancient stars
That's just who we are
Dust of ancient stars
Some love makes you cry
Some loves say goodbye
Some love stays inside your heart for life
Once love takes you in
Gets beneath your skin it seems so right
Like a key that opens every door
You give me the love I've waited for
Some love makes you cry
Some loves say goodbye
Your love stays inside my heart for life
Like a key that opens every door
You give me the love I've waited for
Some love makes you cry
Some loves say goodbye
Your love stays inside my heart for life
True Love knows the way
Across the sea of time.
Straight to the place we long to find.
It paints those pretty blue and sunny skies.
Good souls lost at sea
Caught up in storms like these
Would never leave the land behind.
Maybe that's the reason Love is blind.
True Love knows the song
The wind is yet to play
Knows every word your heart would say.
Each breath rolls along
The trees begin to sway
The melody will carry us away.
Into that great unknown
To far to ever change my mind.
Maybe that's the reason Love is blind.
Into that great unknown
Too far to ever change my mind
Maybe that's the reason Love is blind.
I'll catch your smile on someone's face
Your whisper in the wind's embrace
Through diamond stars and songs and dreams
I find your love in everything
All conspire to comfort me
From sorrow's edge life's beauty seems
To find your love in everything
I've come to trust the hope it brings
To find your love in everything
Even through my shattered heart
I'll catch your smile on someone's face
God is in a place that's near... sometimes it's just not so clear
God is in the flowing Tao then and now and now and now
God is in the Atheist... and all the things that don't exist
God is in... God is in... God is in...
I don't know where you go
In between the lightning and the darkness
I just know I'm not alone
Beautiful Universe...
God is so inspired by those who fly and those who try
God's love with love so live
Live and love and that's enough
God is in sweet drops
Of the rain and snow and
God is in the silent nights of dreams and in the sweet by and by
Living peacefully where music is the only divinity
And find love to the end of my days
I'll reach a higher understanding coming out of confusion from
Chaos to cosmos the center it unfolds
The creation of a world of my own all alone
Transcending the mundane to a Spiritual plane where the revelation to make music first came
My words amplified across desert terrain to where You and yours reside to take blame
It's unorthodox the paradox of
For the love of music
I am consciously devoted
Practice over theory the philosophy in motion just a token
Over sequenced patterns of music prolific
Living peacefully where music is the only divinity
And find love to the end of my days
Love to the end of my days
If love could say God's Name
We'd hear a trillion sounds
Choirs from the balconies
Grass grow through the ground
The sound would ring so true
As every fist uncurled
The prayers of an atheist
Sent from the emptiness
Even they find the way back home...
If love could say God's name
And we would just be still
Silence would start to sing
And nature reveal God's will
If love could say God's name
How could we not behold
Well my heart don't care if my feet say no
All the way from Paris to the hills of Tennessee
Well my mouth says never but my soul says now
I got a portable devil and a sacred cow
Hare Krishna dances... Buddha smiles eternally
Holy Mother Mary... gently waving back to me
There's a quiet void of silence
In the stillness of the emptiness I've found
Louder than the jingle jangle clanging bang
Well my life is a rumor but my death rings clear
Like a bell in the ether of the atmosphere
As I watch my future turn the corner by degrees
I could miss forever like the forest for the trees
For the Beauty of the earth
For the glory of the skies
For the love which from our birth
Over and around us lies
Lord of all to thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise
For the wonder of each hour
Of the day and of the night
Hill and vale and tree and flower
Sun and moon and Stars of light
Lord of all to thee we raise
Here under heaven's eyes
Sometimes it seems like we're so small.
Here on the shores that reach into infinity.
Like sand on a mountain
A breeze in this tornado
Just do what you can.
And shine all your light in the sun
We live to learn to love.
We sing our hearts to you
Our song of gratitude
All our prayers will add up
Like sand on a mountain
A breeze in this tornado
Just do what you can.
And shine all your light in the sun
Like sand on a mountain
A breeze in this tornado
Just do what you can.
Be still my soul the Lord is by thy side
Stand tall within the of storm of grief and pain
Trust in thy God to order and provide
Through every change his faithful light remains
Through trying times leads to a joyful end
Be still my soul the wind and waves shall know
The voice who ruled them while he dwelt below
Torment and doubt have slipped into the past
All dark and mysteries shall shine at last
His burning sun shall melt the ice of fear
That trembling skies speak to the fear in thee
The face of God illuminates the night
Unending peace and trusting perfect light
Appointed by some higher up
No one wants to pay for love
Oh you beautiful fool
Dreams weren't meant to come true
Oh you beautiful fool
And all us kids were so upset
We thought that you were a trouble instigator
To fight a fight without a fist all human instinct puzzles this
How dare you threaten our existence
Consistently we are resistant to love
I saw you on the black and white
With Blacks and White's applauding you
I saw you on another time
Without a sign of life in you
Oh you beautiful fool
Dreams weren't meant to come true
Fear cannot scare you
Death cannot kill you
Hunger can't starve you
Guilt cannot blame you
When you're doubting your direction
And you feel like giving up
Beauty would tempt you
Thank you my Lord for a beautiful day
Thank you my Lord for the rivers that flow
There'd be nothing I know without you
For the music and the songs that I sing
For the laughter and the joy that you bring
For the mountains that you gave me to climb
Holding my hand all the time
Thank you my Lord for the birds and the trees
I'd be nothing at all without you.
For the music and the songs that I sing
For the laughter and the joy that you bring
For the mountains that you gave me to climb
Holding my hand all the time
Thank you my Lord for the birds and the trees
And the sky is endless blue
That this life was lent to you
Say goodbye to all the bad days
Silver lined those clouds roll through
May you find what makes you happy
In this life that's lent to you
In everyone's heart there will be sadness
For some of the choices that we make
But the river of time flows behind us
And softens the edge of our mistakes
So come outside and walk this garden
Drink the light like roses do
O come ye now unto the flame
Keep it through the night
Nourish it and share its warmth
And spend its precious light
The torch is passed among us all
To help us understand
A covenant of brotherhood
That joins our open hand
We are standing at the edge
Faced with just one choice
Teach each other to be kind
And let our hearts rejoice
As different as we seem to be
We are still the same
Divided by our separate walls
But joined before the flame
O come ye now unto the flame
Keep it through the night
Shelter and embrace it's warmth
And spend it's precious light
The darkness makes us all afraid
The beacon of our common love
The Mother of the Children of Fishes
Is the Owner of the River
The Owner of the River is
come with Thy grace and heavenly aid
to fill the hearts which Thou hast made
and sweet anointing from above
with patience firm and virtue high
the weakness of our flesh supply
henceforth by all in earth and heaven.
Let us be thankful to Jesus
Because He died for us
He was Merciful in His Death for us
Black and white must be grateful to Him
Let them raise their voices to the King
Sometimes I don't know where to roam
Sometimes I don't know where to roam
But I heard of a city called Heaven
None of these are eternally mine.
I do not know how to act righteously or find your abode
I am devoid of devotion and surrender
I am not strong enough to make any vow
And whomever I am with
In pleasure and distress
Powerless and without Inner wealth
Deluded by ignorance and unable to see the light of truth
In yonder valley there flows sweet union
Let us arise and drink our fill
The winter's passed and the spring appears
The turtle dove is in our land
In yonder valley there flows sweet union
Like a fruitful apple blossom
I was allowed to shelter beneath him
And a thousand times more pleasing than wine
On my lips were the fruits of his form
For while I can see Jesus Christ's fair face
At the same fork in the road
We're still carrying this long
Crashed through anger
Stormed the boundaries
If we could just remember kindness
And all I ever wanted
Was a love that I could say was mine
It could last a lifetime
At the entrance to the caves
If we stand and face our shadows
Maybe this love can be saved
But I can't wake up in your darkness
I've got darkness of my own
But there's sacred light between us
That's enough to guide us home
That's enough to get us home
And all I ever wanted
Was a love that I could say was mine
It could last a lifetime
Sweet love's coming back around this time
Sweet love finally found this heart of mine
Sweet love opened up my eyes
Love that I can see forever
I can see me loving you
There is nothing I won't do
We can start right now
I can see me loving you
When we're old and gray
Born into this world of darkness
Always reaching towards the light
Gently roll into that good night
I can see me loving you
Shining through all eternity
Take my hand and walk with me
Pass the point of no return
Might wake up some day
And wonder what life's coming to
All I know is from the moment
You're as far as I can see
I can see me loving you
You could spend your whole life
Wanting what you don't have
Tangled in the pain and strife
Dragging up the ghost of your past
You can curse the rain
But the river remains
Even as it all goes by
And there are dreams we hold
In the palm of our hand
How the story will end
Even as it all goes by
Flying through the hourglass
So love me like a slow dance
Kiss me while the world flies past
And the scenery is changed
And as time goes through
I will hold on to you
Even as it all goes by
Flying through the hourglass
As fleeting as the first light
Reaching through the darkest night
It can never be still
Like the earth that spins
Where it ends it begins
Even as it all goes by
Even as it all goes by
Life has taught me this
And if anything is true
Faced with what we lack
Some things fall apart
But from the ashes new dreams start
All that matters to the heart
From the smallest act of kindness
In spite of our mistakes
If we lose or if we win
All that matter in the end
I will not forget your kindness
When I needed it so much
Trying to be so strong
In this world of right and wrong
All that matters when we've gone
All that mattered all along
All we have that carries on
To the stacks and scraps of paper
Puppets hanging in the kitchen
In an avalanche of wind chimes
Welcome to my guesses
To the questions unremembered
In a myriad of choices
In the fragments of my sentences
Need you like an arrow needs
The center of a circle
Like sleep and light and oxygen
And your warm arms around me
Try to find a million ways
Welcome to the circus
And the days so swift unfolding
Where I have no flipping clue
Welcome to the lessons
And the dance of sweet forgiveness
To the gift of my intentions
And the depth of my commitment
Need you through the spirals
In the dark nights of my soul
The story that we share
And you'll never let me go
Evermore and ever after
After all that we have weathered
Weather anything else matters
Deep inside our single heart
All the roads to heaven start
Sun and moon shall fall and rise
Every day begins baptized
This is about more than love
Storm through life like clouds of rain
Hope and grace and peace above
Shining from the other side
Follow the song into the dance
It won't take long given the chance
Soon we'll find out what we're made of
This is about more than love
Happiness showed up today
And rang its bell above the din
Long enough to change the spin
And turn my wheels around
I had driven past my last regret
Down the side road of despair
Where the answers don't come off the rear
And grace just can't be found
All my fears disguised as truth
Danced the dark night of my soul
But the light of day revealed no proof
If God would let me down
Happiness showed up today
Drunk again and full of wit
And leave those tears to dry
The future cannot be controlled
And the only moment we can hold
All those lies I told myself
Makes the heart feel like a concrete slab
Happiness showed up today
A silver throated mockingbird
With the sweetest song I ever heard
When I hear the sound
For the rest of my life
Every turn on the way
Brings me close to the day
Everything remembering
Every wave surrenders
Time peels back the sky
Hurl shadows at the wind
Let's watch the sunset
Hurl shadows at the wind
A word held in my heart
A candle for the times
I don't know these steps
And there's a spot light
Screaming through my head
We'll dance until we're dead
Hurl shadows at the wind
A word held in my heart
My candle for the times
And it's the same haze
Hurl shadows at the wind
I have come from so far away
Down the road of my own mistakes
In the hope you could hear me pray
How I've longed through these wasted years
To outrun all the pain and fear
And now it's your grace I seek
Love won't compromise
It's a gift it's a sacrifice
My soul renewed and my heart released
In you I'll find my peace
Shining star make this love you bring
So bright that I may believe
That my way will not be lost
My soul renewed and my spirit free
In you I'll find my peace
My soul renewed and my spirit free
With a thousand twists and turns
There are promises to keep
There are endless things to learn
Through the laughter and the tears
Letting go is how you steer
And it always leads you home
It will never hold you back
Like the branches of a tree
And it opens wide each heart
Like the sea that breaks the stone
No matter where you stop
It will always lead you home
And it only wants what's best
There are doors it pulls us through
As it puts us to the test
And there's nothing to pretend
In our hearts somehow we've known
The path of love won't end
The path of love won't end
Godspeed your souls return
Deep from these waters
Straight to the angels arms
How sweet the days gone by
How sharp the corners
How blue the canvas sky
And oh somehow I know we're not apart
For I still hold your love inside my heart
How soft this light of grace
Shines through my sorrow
From some amazing place
And oh somehow I know we're not apart
For I still hold your love inside my heart
Godspeed your souls return
Deep from these waters
Straight to the angels arms
Ten thousand nights of darkness
In the ether underneath this garden
You are my heart's calling...
One star in a million
One voice in a thousand
I will know your love
I will know your love
I've sailed on this ocean
But I will know your love
I will know your love
I'll know... your voice
I'll know... your touch
I know I'll know your love
One chance that'll come by
One dance in your arms
And I will know your love
I will know your love
One star in a million
I will know your love
I will know your love
It's scary how you move me
There's a heartbreak in the air
And every time you hold me
Seems like the perfect love affair
I've got a real uneasy feeling
That I've been down this road before
Here's where I always start believing
Love can't hurt me anymore
I can't let you any closer
I need a little time to think this through
I better get away from you
Now you've heard that old expression
You gotta look before you leap
I've already learned that lesson
So until I know you love's for keeps
When the wind blows me back
And this world has hurt my feelings
Just a little light is all I'm needing
But you send me the sun
Send me the sun wrapped in a rainbow
And I'll wash my face in this rain
And brave this tornado
Who could send me the sun
When my world has pinned me down
So I can't see through the clouds
Darkness falling all around
But you send me the sun
Heaven knows this heart of mine
Is only waiting for a sign
I've got my face turned to the sky
Send me the sun wrapped in a rainbow
And I'll wash my face in this rain
And brave this tornado
Who could send me the sun
Through the sleepless nights
Oh these sleepless nights
Will break my heart in two
Somehow through the days
Oh but then through sleepless nights
I keep hoping you'll come back to me
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone
Sometimes I feel like a bird in the sky
Sometimes I feel like a bird in the sky
Sometimes I feel like a bird in the sky
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
In ways to write your name
Love letter scraps no strings attached
Just odds and ends and things
Wind blows through these photographs
Thanks to spring I changed my purse
Came upon this ancient curse
The ache and thirst to feel your touch
I wonder if I'll love that much again
Like cars these days go by
Like feelings locked inside
Thanks to spring I clean these drawers
Dump this stuff out on the floor
I wonder if I'll ever love that much again
Thanks to spring I wind these clocks
Empty out these cardboard boxes
Sweep across these closet shelves
The memories replay themselves
I open up my window wide
And smell the sweet new grass outside
I wonder if I'll ever love that much again
I heard the big city never sleeps
Hear they roll up the streets around 10 o'clock
On the other side of River Bridge
There's a spot on Powell Ridge where the asphalt stops
Sometimes when the sky is clear
We slip away and disappear
You got heaven on earth down here
Sometimes I hear from an old friend
I hadn't seen since I don't know when
We'll laugh and shed some tears
Catch up on the past few years in a minute or two
I know it's hard for you to believe
You got heaven on earth down here
No need to watch the clock
Time moves so slow down here you can almost feel it start
You got heaven on earth down here
I wanna be there when the sun goes down
I'm blessed to be born in this angel's town
I can't wait to see those brown hills come in view
Rolling down Sonora Avenue
I wanna be there when the sun goes down
I'm blessed to be born in this angel's town
I can't wait to see those brown hills come in view
Rolling down Sonora Avenue
I wanna be there when the sun goes down
I'm blessed to be born in this angel's town
I can't wait to see those brown hills come in view
Rolling down Sonora Avenue
Rolling down Sonora Avenue
I wanna be there when the suns goes down
I packed my suitcase full of pride
Said some words and said goodbye
Love started calling me back home
At the front door here I am
About to wake up my best friend
I know that she will understand and try and help me
But I know she'll she right through
See how much I'm missing you
It's really not the way I planned
I'll find someone who lets me run wide open
Who doesn't try to change me
From who I'm meant to be
I'm just a girl who laughs out loud when I'm nervous
Feel like the main attraction in the circus
When the lights go out I'm different
And all I want to see is
Whose heart will protect me
I'm just a girl who cries sometimes for no reason
Been known to wear the wrong clothes for the season
Who won't misdirect me
My life's not so ordinary
Sometimes sane and sometimes scary
Am I wrong for wanting someone so
Who won't misdirect me
Whose smile disconnects me
Whose heart will protect me
Let's not take one thing for granted
Life doesn't always go the way we plan it
We found each other somehow
So let's make a promise right now
We'll always be together
Even as the good times come and go
Let's dream like we're gonna live forever
To ask nothing in return
We'll always be together
Even as the good times come and go
Let's dream like we're gonna live forever
When soul mates are lovers and friends
You can't define where one begins and the other one ends
We'll always be together
We'll always be together
Even as the good times come and go
Let's dream like we're gonna live forever
This is the last place I should be
We both know where this will lead
I made myself a promise
I should have thought this through
I try to move on and you tried to move out
What kind of love is this we're in
That makes me want you again and again
Am I really lost or just finding my way
I try to move on and you tried to move out
It's the madness we choose to endure
It's the push and it's the pull
I try to move on and you tried to move out
So why am I standing just where I am
I need you to kiss me and make it all clear
And I'll carry them deep in my soul
With every choice you make in your life
You'll know when you know it's right
Sometimes I want to run and hide
And just deny that voice inside
Lord it's never ever wrong
When you're standing in the light of the truth
Nothing can get to you
With every choice you make in your life
You'll know when you know it's right
And I'll carry them deep in my soul
With every choice you make in your life
You'll know when you know it's right
Let's leave this behind
We've got the road and the radio
Ain't got time to punch that clock
Can't be something that I'm not
A girl's just got to rock
Can't wait till she gets off
There's more to life than this rodeo
Ain't got time to punch that clock
Can't be something that I'm not
A girl's just got to rock
Ain't got time to punch that clock
Can't be something that I'm not
A girl's just got to rock
Ain't got time to punch that clock
Living on the edge is all I've got
A girl's just got to rock
I never dreamed I'd find somebody
I'd been doing things my way so long
I thought I knew everything
Could show me a love so true
Love was in the stalks for me
I was the one who was always left hanging
And that's the way it would always be
Could show me a love so true
For the everything that I ever learned
Could show me a love so true
Could show me a love so true
I know it's way too soon
But I can't take another moon
No you didn't kiss me goodnight
But the night is so long with no end in sight
Here in my arms is where you belong
I can't remember why we ever said we were through
Lost somewhere missing me
Needing that kiss from me too
Here in my arms is where you belong
I can't remember why we ever said we were through
Lost somewhere missing me
Needing that kiss from me too
Baby those sweet memories make me their fool
Shadows they tease and the silence is so cruel
Nothing is left and nothing feels right
Have you ever met an angel
Whose smile is like the sun
Whose laugh is like a melody
That reaches everyone
Have you ever hugged an angel
Swept up in their embrace
I swear there's nothing
In this world that makes you feel that safe
Have you ever really loved an angel
Once you have you'll never be the same again
Have you ever had to let go of an angel
Have you felt the strength of an angel
When you need it the most
Lifted by those gentle wings
You know you're not alone
Every now and then I feel the peace inside
Have you ever really loved an angel
Once you have you'll never be the same again
Have you ever had to let go of an angel
How could I ever be the same
All of my friends tell me that I am the good girl
They all see me as me being so perfect
Little miss goody two shoes
They all gasp and I just say
And let their wild side show
I try to be the good girl mama raised me up to be
Sometimes breaking all the rules sounds mighty good to me
Like going where I don't belong
And let their wild side show
Good girls wanna get crazy sometimes too
And let their wild side show
Before you open up to speak
Think of what your saying to me
My heart only deals in honesty
And tell me that forever I can hope
That we'll always be together
Aren't we all just looking to find true love
It doesn't really make much sense
And nothing feels as good as holding you close
Some do it for the rush
Some do it for the thrill of any touch
Aren't we all just looking to find true love
It's the kind that don't come easy
If we give ourselves completely
Aren't we all just looking to find true love
Aren't we all just looking to find
Fast asleep and dreaming
Why bad things happen to good people
I've got memories of a smiling face
Why bad things happen to good people
Every night I say the same soft prayer
Watch over the ones that I love
Why bad things happen to good people
And you ain't lonely yet
You don't know how it feels
To have a broken heart
One that ain't never gonna heal
And I hope you never will
Try to be happy some how
I tried to call you about a hundred times
You don't know how it feels
To have a broken heart
One that ain't never gonna heal
I hope you never will
But you ain't lonely yet
You ain't as lonely as it gets
You ain't as lonely as it gets
You don't know how it feels
To have a broken heart
One that ain't never gonna heal
And I hope you never will
Try to be happy somehow
Sure looks warm inside through the window pane
So slide the chain off this old door
Or I can say I'm sorry for the rest of my life
You could open the door and let me see what's wrong
Well don't you know you can't be right all the time
And head on out that door
Like too many nights before
Then she tells me baby there ain't no need
I'll say it again if I thought it would
Make you treat me baby like you know you should
Now we both know this ain't the first time around
You go out loud and come back in without a sound
And head on out that door
Like too many nights before
Then she tells me baby there ain't no need
I'll say it again if I thought it would
Make you treat me baby like you know you should
Then she tells me baby now ain't no need
I'll say it again if I thought it would
Make you treat me baby like you know you should
Say it again if I thought it would
Make you treat me baby like you know you could
Sunday in Memphis it's hallelujah dawn
Such a beautiful song
I can hear the church bells ringing
Here on these sidewalks
It's Sunday in Memphis
And I'm down to my last prayer
And I'm wishing you were here
With every step that's taken
And every tear that's shed
Fell down on my knees
Said please forgive me lord won't you please
It's Sunday in Memphis
And I'm down to my last prayer
And I'm wishing you were here
We all make mistakes sometimes
That's just the way it goes
But we can change and make it right I know
It's Sunday in Memphis
And I'm down to my last prayer
Sometimes it seems like I'm going nowhere
And I can't seem to stay in one place too long
Same old town with a different name
Now if I had a dollar every mile I drove
You know I would be rich beyond words
Money ain't the only thing I'd want
And I can't seem to stay in one place too long
Think of me when you hear the wind blow
I stick around but not too long
Restless wind keeps me moving on
And I can't seem to stay in one place too long
On the banks of the river by the railroad track
We kept chickens in a pen in the back
My daddy was a farmer but all he ever raised was us
Salvation Army give us clothes to wear
A man from the county came to cut our hair
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
That was ten dollar less than the landlord wanted for rent
The landlord's letters got nasty indeed
He wrote get out but pa couldn't read
And we was too broke to even pay heed
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
But we had something in our house money can't buy
Kept us warm in the winter cool when the sun was high
For whenever we didn't have food enough
We patched the cracks and set the table with love
The bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights.
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights.
The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
Did the God who put those stars above make those city lights
Did he make a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
Are we just supposed to run and hide behind those city lights.
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
As long as I live if it be one hour or if it be one hundred years
I'll keep remembering forever and ever I'll love you dear as long as I live
It was easy said the night we parted that we'd forget we'd ever met
I haven't forgotten I wonder if you have or if your heart is full of regret
I never thought the night we parted that life without you could be so bad
I know it sounds funny but I can't forget you the only happiness I've ever had
In the twilight glow I see her blue eyes crying in the rain
As we kissed goodbye and parted I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dying ember only memories remain
Through the ages I'll remember blue eyes crying in the rain
Now my hair has turned to silver all my life I've loved in vain
I can see her star in heaven blue eyes crying in the rain
Some day when we meet up yonder we'll stroll hand in hand again
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long.
The one I love she's on that train and gone.
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long.
I went across the river to lay me down to sleep
I went across the river to lay me down to sleep
I went across the river gonna me down to sleep
I woke up and I had shackles on my feet.
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long.
I asked the judge what's gonna be my fine
I asked the judge what's gonna be my fine
I said old judge what's gonna be my fine
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I get to thinking lots of times about back when I was a lad
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
And come morning Rock of Ages would wake me gently once again
And when daddy would reach up and he'd take the Bible down
And he'd read it read it loud and long
And I always felt that maybe our house was blessed
When daddy would say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess and then Bob and then Tommy and then Dan
By then dad's hair was turning white and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that as daddy's back grew weak my mother's faith just grew strong
And those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
I guess the house is still standing I don't get to go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls and no steps to grace the floor
For you see my mother sings in heaven now around God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this world is a better place
I'd rather live a life of lies and fantasy
Than face the truth and realize you're leaving me
You built me up so high my heart can't stand the fall
And life without you love just isn't life at all.
So walk out backwards if you must go
And please don't wave goodbye
Just wave one last hello
The truth won't hurt so much
If I can't just pretend
So walk out backwards and
I'll think you're walking in.
You walked into my heart in search of sympathy
From that day down to this you've walked all over me
And now you're walking out to love somebody new
But you're not by yourself cause my heart's leaving too.
So walk out backwards if you must go
And please don't wave goodbye
Just wave one last hello
The truth won't hurt so much
If I can't just pretend
So walk out backwards and
I have the invitation that you sent me
You wanted me to see you change your name
I couldn't stand to see you wed another
I hope that you'll be happy just the same.
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
That should be ringing now for you and me
And down the aisle with someone else you're walking
Those wedding bells will never ring for me.
I planned a little cottage in the valley
I even bought a little band of gold
I hope someday to place it on your finger
But now the future looks so dark and cold.
I fancy that I see a bunch of roses
A blossom from an orange tree in your hair
And as the organ plays I'll love you truly
Just let me pretend that I am there.
As the angel chorus sweetly sings
But as long as I am on this earth dear
Wanna be back in Tennessee
Way down in Columbus Stockade
Friends have turned their backs on me.
Never let me cross your mind
In your heart you love another
Last night as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I woke I was mistaken
I was peeping through the bars.
Never let me cross your mind
In your heart you love another
My mama always told me better
Than to play with a loaded gun
Never had a prisoner for a son.
The picture's still in front of my eyes
When the jury said he's guilty
The sunrise over that some old sea
An empty cell for company.
Yet there's not very much that stands between
Me and the freedom I hold dear
I kissed my darling on her tender lips
And they took me by the hand
I had a nice little ride on a ferry boat
To the rock where the prison stands.
The warden said as he locked the door
I hope you'll like it here
Just make yourself a home
I've almost forgotten what my real name is
Been a number for so long
Making little bitty rocks out of great big rocks
Gets old as the days wear on.
Just try to stay alive
The sunrise over that some old sea
An empty cell for company.
Yet there's not very much that stands between
Me and the freedom I hold dear
I reached out my arms and I touched you with soft words I whispered your name
I held you right on the tip of my fingers but that was as close as I came
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands but I let it slip right through my hands
Somebody took you when I wasn't looking and I should have known from the start
It's a long long way from the tip of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart to the love hidden deep in your heart
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
And she's gone gone gone and she's gone gone gone and I'll bid her my last farewell
I fell in love with a pretty little thing I thought that wedding bells would ring
She was as sweet as she could be till I found out what she did to me
Railroad steamboat...
Now I won't cry my life away some other sucker will have to pay
And when he finds that she is gone I bet I'll hear him sing this song
I've lost count of the hours
And I've lost track of the days
And that's one thing that no one can mar
I don't know who you're with
I don't even know where you've gone
My only hope is that some day you might hear this song
And you'll know that I wrote it especially for you
This flame in my heart is like an eternal fire
For every day it burns hotter
And every day it burns higher
And I haven't been able to put out one little flicker
Not even with all of these tears
My friends think I'm crazy and maybe I am
But I'll carry this torch just as long as I can
And I want you to know
There you were standing there smiling as you made your plans
You were going to leave me and go with him
You said you loved him so and your love would always be
And that's the very same thing you once told to me
And you still had my little golden band on your hand
Does my little band of gold mean nothing to you
To me it means the world but you've torn my world apart
You're leaving me alone with my broken heart
There you were standing there...
So take my little golden band from your hand
My little band of gold means nothing to you
To me it meant the world but you've torn my world apart
You're leaving me alone with my broken heart
You told me that you'd love me until the end of time
But you are only human and humans change their minds
You left me without warning and the storm brought me pain
And down down down came the rain
All your love would bring a man so much happiness
That the heavens had to send the rain to divide it up I guess
I stumble through the darkness still calling your name
And down down down came the rain
From a jack to a king from loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an ace and I won a queen and walked away with your heart
The Lady Luck played her hand just right to make me king of your heart
For just a little while I thought that I might lose again
Then just in time I saw the twinkle in your eye
From a jack to a king from loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an ace and I won a queen you make me King of your heart
And Henry left his farm
Left his darling Molly
With a baby in her arms.
And their life could begin
Molly saw her darling
Standing at the door again.
Your voice again Molly
Your arms around me Molly.
Maybe I should have written
To let you know ahead of time
But I was afraid that you'd worry Molly
If you knew that I'd gone blind.
Do I hear you crying Molly
You've even brought a tear into my eyes.
What does he look like Molly
That he took after me
Golly I wish I could see.
Don't be afraid I'm your daddy
I guess he'll get used to me
Your voice again Molly
Your arms around me Molly.
When I was a little boy my daddy used to say to me son
Come with your pappy to the cotton patch and get a little dirt on your hands
Get a little dirt on your hands boy get a little dirt on your hands
If you're gonna grow up to be a big big man
Well I got to be twenty and I thought I was a pretty big wheel
Left the country for the city met a slicker with a shady deal
If you're gonna get along in this big bad world
You gotta get a little dirt on your hands
Get a little dirt on your hands boy...
Well it's four in the morning and the warden is a calling my name
Says he's teaching me a lesson gonna send me out to work in the rain
Dig that ditch boy chop that corn I gotta make you understand
Only way to straighten out a guy like you is to get a little dirt on your hands
Tonight I walk the streets of Baltimore
Ain't no telling where I'll be tomorrow
My baby don't care and I don't anymore.
I'm running from the one I'm longing for
My baby don't care and I don't anymore.
My baby fell in love with a man in Frisco
Left me standing in the midnight freezing cold
I took a train back east to West Virginia
But there ain't no taking this aching out of my soul.
I'm running from the one I'm longing for
My baby don't care and I don't anymore.
Scares me scares me through and through
And if I lived to be a hundred years old I never will forget that day
Although I never mentioned it I cried that whole day long
I feel like I've been gone forever but now I'm coming home
Oh it's been such a long time darling but it won't be long now
And I want you to know that while I've been gone I've kept every single vow
I just hope you're still gonna love me
As much as you did when you told me goodbye
It's been such a long time darling please don't blame me if I cry
He carried a Bible in a canvas sack
And folks just called him The Reverend Mr. Black.
I gotta walk that lonesome valley.
I got to walk it by myself.
Oh nobody else can walk it for me.
I got to walk it by myself.
If ever I could have thought this man in black
I gave that notion up the day
A lumberjack came in and it wasn't to pray.
He hit that Reverend like a kick of a mule
You gotta walk that lonesome valley
You gotta walk it by yourself
You gotta walk it by yourself.
It's been many years since we had to part
And I guess I learned his ways by heart.
Down in the valley where he used to sing.
And I hope I will always be a credit
You gotta walk that lonesome valley
You gotta walk it by yourself
You gotta walk that lonesome valley
You gotta walk it by yourself
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
You've grown cold and no longer care for me
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these tears from my eyes and let me see
Just a spark of the love that used to be
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Give my heart just a word of sympathy
Be as fair to my heart as you can be
Then if you no longer care
For the love that's beating there
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
The greatest gift that I posses
With more than my share of happiness.
To me this old world is a wonderful place
And I'm just about the luckiest human in the whole human race
I've got no silver and I've got no gold
Just a whole lot of happiness in my soul.
The greatest gift that I posses
With more than my share of happiness.
Happiness to me is an ocean tide
Or a sunset fading on a mountain side
Or maybe a big old heaven full of stars up above
When I'm in the arms of the one I love.
Happiness is a field of grain
Lifting its face to the falling rain
I can see it in the sunshine
The greatest gift that I posses
With more than my share of happiness.
A wise old man told me one time
That happiness is nothing but a frame of mind
I hope when you go to measuring my success
The greatest gift that I posses
With more than my share of happiness.
The greatest gift that I posses
Somewhere a telephone is ringing right now
Someone's old sweetheart is on the line
She's calling to patch up an old love affair
Somebody's writing a letter right now
Somebody's darling longs to come home
But you never write me and you never phone
There's somebody else on your mind
And somebody's heart is glad you don't love me
You never write me and you never phone
There's somebody else on your mind
And somebody's heart is glad that you left me
The one I love found another
She ran away with my best friend
Came home last night for just an hour
Daylight came she's gone again.
She never loved me anyway
She only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was love to stay.
There's only one thing you can do
Just dig a hole crawl right in it
And pull the ground in after you.
She never loved me anyway
She only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was love to stay.
Life without love is mighty empty
When you've got no one that you can hold
I'd rather have love I can cling to
Than have the world and all of it's gold.
She never loved me anyway
She only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was love to stay.
She never loved me anyway
She only wanted someone to play with
In the misty moonlight by the flickering firelight
Anyplace is all right long as I'm with you
In a faraway land by the trophic sea sand if your hand's in my hand I won't be blue
Way up on the mountain a way down in the valley
I know I'll be happy anyplace anywhere I don't care
In the misty moonlight by the flickering firelight
Anyplace is all right long as you are there
I could be happy in one little room with only a table and a chair
As happy as I'd be in a kingdom by the sea darling if you were there
And I could be rich or I could be poor in fact if you were by my side
I could be anything in the whole wide world and I know I'd be satisfied
Way up on the mountain...
In the misty moonlight by the flickering firelight
If there's water in the desert
If you were not an angel
You could turn the night to day
Make all my dreams come true
Say how far it is to heaven
Then I'll stop loving you.
If the earth is up above us
If there are daisies in the desert
If today can be tomorrow
If old things can be new
If you can live without a heartbeat
Then I'll stop loving you.
There's no daisies in the desert
The earth is not above us
The stars are not below.
Today can't be tomorrow
Old things can't be new
I can't live without a heartbeat
I've got lots of golden memories
Of a million things I've said and done
But when I separate them
Darling you're my memory No. 1.
I've called lots of others sweetheart
And I admit I've had some fun
But when I stop and think of true love
You're my memory No. 1.
Even fools sometimes get lonesome
And I guess that's what this fool has gone and done
For tonight I'm thinking of old memories
And you're my memory No. 1.
Even fools sometimes get lonesome
And I guess that's what this fool has gone and done
For tonight I'm thinking of old memories
When he holds you I'll be somewhere
When he kisses you I'll be somewhere
And then when he takes you in his arms
And you go where the music's soft and the lights are dim
I'll be somewhere wishing I were him.
Wishing that I have my arms around you
Wishing you still cared for me the way it used to be
And then when you hold him tight and you tell him
That you'll never ever love another again
I'll be somewhere wishing I were him.
And then when you hold him tight and tell him
That you'll never ever love another again
And you're saying what a crazy fool I am
But the one I love is out tonight with him
I need a drink but all the bars are locked up tight
A lonely man gets mighty thirsty late at night
There's the river here's the bridge it's too late now
I've got nothing left to live for anyhow
In the news they'll say he couldn't even swim
Worry the nights away
Worry all through the day
I worry what's come over you
Worry somehow you've changed
Worry you seem so strange
I worry what am I gonna do.
Your lips keep saying that you care
But your heart just isn't there
And your eyes reveal the lies your lips have told
Guess I've known it all along
I'm slowly losing you and all that I can do is.
Worry the nights away
Worry all through the day
He came down from the mansion on the mountain
He kissed you and he handed you a line
I begged you not to go I said darling don't forget me
In case you ever change your mind.
And the berries grow redder on the vine
But the candle still glows in the window in the valley
In case you ever change your mind.
Just in case you ever change your mind
And long to hold the love you left behind
I'll be waiting till the end of time
In case you ever change your mind.
Are the stars any bigger on the mountain
Is the sun any brighter when it shines
In case you ever change your mind.
Just in case you ever change your mind
And long to hold the love you left behind
I'll be waiting till the end of time
In case you ever change your mind.
They said our love was just emotion that time would slowly fade away
But time just deepen my devotion I love you more and more every day
The day you made those tender vows beside me
My joy was more than words could ever say
And darling still it grows and grows inside me
I love you more and more every day
The day you made those tender vows beside me...
One more hour and I'll be home
Close my eyes and rest my bones
Can't be more than a mile or so
Cincinnati where the river winds
Heaven waits for me I know
I guess perhaps the memories got too strong
Grabbed me by the heart strings and pulled me home
Now there she lies at the foot of the hill
Shining like a jewel in the valley
Cincinnati where the river winds
Heaven waits for me I know
In your haste you left and said you'd be returning
In my sorrow I forgot to ask you when
In my lonely room I sit and count the hours
For then and only then will I stop crying
And this aching breaking heart of mind will mend
Not until I feel your arms around me
Will I be happy and I live for then and only then
All that's left inside my heart is just an echo
And the tiny thread of hope to which I cling
But if I keep holding on maybe some day
You'll remember where you left me and come back for me again
For then and only then...
If it's true what you say in your letter
If your sweet love for me is really gone
If there's somebody else that you love better
Ain't no future in the past. broken hearts and all that jazz
So you took my photograph from your locket
And replaced it with the one you love the best
Give me back my ring and I'll go hock it
What's one little diamond more or less.
Ain't no future in the past. broken hearts and all that jazz
Ain't no future in the past. broken hearts and all that jazz
I sit alone most every night
Watch those trains pull out of sight
Don't I wish they were carrying me
Nothing in this old town for me
Wish to the Lord that I could be
Now do you want my love or are we through
I've got my heart in my hand but there's so much that I don't understand
And baby I don't know what I've done wrong
You know I worship the ground you walked on
Don't you cry when you see I'm gone
There ain't no woman gonna settle me down
There ain't nobody in this whole wide world
Gonna tell me how to spend my time
I don't care when the sun goes down
Where I lay my weary head
I came home last night to a dark and lonely cottage
I took the wreath off the door and somehow I stumbled inside
I just can't I just can't I said live without her
Give me one reason to live now that my darling has died.
And then five little fingers
Too young to understand.
And there was a softness in my little girl's touch
That seemed to say daddy I need you so
And in five little seconds her five little fingers
Told me all that I wanted to know.
I could tell her little eyes were full of questions
I tried to answer but all I could do was hold her tight
Forgive me forgive me I said for crying
But darling your daddy has got such a load on his shoulders tonight.
And then five little fingers
Touched me on the cheek
And gently brushed away a tear.
And I knew that in her own little way
My baby was saying daddy I love you so
It only took five little seconds for her five little fingers
To tell me all that I needed to know.
Seen Boulder Dam and Frisco Bay
I been to New York City and Washington
And I've worked in three
All night service stations and drove a truck
I had the mumps and the measles and the seven years itch
Not to mention all the times
Tat I've cut my fingers on a sardine can.
Seen Boulder Dam and Frisco Bay
I been to New York City and Washington
Mama's supper table as the sun goes down
And my dear old daddy when the blessing is said
And a great big hunk of my dear sweet mama's
Hot buttered cornbread.
Seen Boulder Dam and Frisco Bay
I been to New York City and Washington
Seen Boulder Dam and Frisco Bay
I been to New York City and Washington
All that's left of all our love now
My lonely world is only eight by ten eight by ten eight by ten
I remember the night that you gave me that picture I ought to
I've relived it so many times I remember how I couldn't wait to get home
Put it in a frame and tell everybody that you were mine.
Because you were mine at least until someone else came along
And took you off out of my sight
It's a good thing that you did leave me your picture to hold
Because now I can cry on your shoulder every night.
My lonely world is only eight by ten.
It's awful to be jealous of an old picture frame
But I'm jealous of anything that's close to you
And that picture frame seems to be holding you pretty tight
That looks like more than I'll ever do.
I wish that I could just be the glass in that frame
And be so close to the lips that I love
I am glad that I've at least got your picture to hold
But sometimes it's just not enough
I'm five hundred miles away from home
Teardrops fell on mama's note when I read the things she wrote
She said we miss you son we love you come on home
I didn't even have to pack I had it all right on my back
Now I'm five hundred miles away from home
Away from home away from home cold and tired and all alone
Yes I'm five hundred miles away from home
I know this is the same road I took the day I left home
Cause time changes everything
I wonder what they'll say when they see their boy looking this way
Oh I wonder what they'll say when I get home
Can't remember when I ate it's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm five hundred miles away from home
If my luck had been just right I'd be with them all tonight
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home
You don't have to be a baby to cry
All you need is for love to go wrong
You don't have to be a baby to cry
Or to lay awake the whole night long
When you leave me my golden rainbow disappears
And you leave me a broken heart full of tears
These ain't raindrops in my eyes what should I lie
You don't have to be a baby to cry
When you leave me my golden rainbow disappears
And you leave me a broken heart full of tears
These ain't raindrops in my eyes what should I lie
He came speeding through the town each day at sundown
And his car was painted candy apple red
He was coming there to see the sheriff's daughter
And the sheriff didn't know it so they said.
Time and time again the sheriff tried to catch him
That old county jail stood patiently a waiting
And the sheriff vowed he'd put him there some day.
If he doesn't slow it down a bit he's gonna end up dead
And the sheriff's daughter said she'd rather end up dead
Than to live without her candy apple red.
So the sheriff built a barricade to catch him
And he sat there at the limits of the town
But the sheriff's daughter had already met him
And she married him before the sun went down.
He saw they couldn't stop and quickly caught his breath
As they crashed the barricade the car exploded
And the boy and girl went to a flaming death.
If he doesn't slow it down a bit he's gonna end up dead
And the sheriff's daughter said she'd rather end up dead
Love is full of happiness
But love is full of dangers
The very best of sweethearts
And became the best of strangers.
I only knew that your two lips
Could kiss and whisper sweet
I never stopped to think
That those two lips could also cheat.
Your precious love was mine
At least that's what I told myself
In the arms of someone else.
I only saw the happiness
I overlooked the dangers
Until the best of sweethearts
Became the best of strangers.
And now they see us in the crowd
And think we've never met
Each time they introduce us
Makes it harder to forget.
But you keep on pretending
I'm somebody you don't know
But the one who loves you so.
Love is full of happiness
But love is full of dangers
The very best of sweethearts
One mile over and two miles back
My heart's been crushed like a paper sack
She loves another it's a natural fact
One mile over and two miles back.
She called me up and told me
She was lonely and she needed my company
But she lived pretty far and my brother had a car
And I had to walk all the way and I got to her house.
I could see through the windows
And I knew she hadn't played fair
For after we had talked and after I had walked
Someone was already there.
And it was one mile over and two miles back
My heart's been crushed like a paper sack
She loves another it's a natural fact
One mile over and two miles back.
My heart fell into little bitty pieces
And it must've weighed eight thousand pounds.
Road back to my house was dark and lonely
And I thought it was never gonna end
I called her name and I cried in vain
And I counted every step I went.
And it was one mile over and two miles back
My heart's been crushed like a paper sack
She loves another it's a natural fact
I love those bright lights and country music
I won't stay home and cry tonight like all the nights before
I've just learned that I don't really need you anymore
I found a little place downtown where guys like me can go
And they've got bright lights and country music
Bright lights and country music a bottle and a glass
Soon I'll be forgetting that there ever was a past
And when everybody asks me what helped me forget so fast
I'll say bright lights and country music
A table by the bandstand a bottle filled with wine
Honky tonks were made for men with women on their minds
Nothing else can take away this loneliness of mine
Quite like bright lights and country music
Bright lights and country music...
You wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
But there's something I'm wanting to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song
I didn't know God made honky tonk angels
I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one who'll ever love you
And went back to the wild side of life
The glamor of the gay night life has lured you
To the places where the wine and liquor flow
I happened to walk into a honky tonk
One night down in New Orleans
Up above the bar hung a big guitar
Like none I'd ever seen.
The neck was set with diamonds
And though the strings were old
Like Kings of sound they wound around
Six keys of solid gold.
A man stepped up beside me
His breath was strong with wine
He said you know that guitar once belonged
To a mighty close pal of mine.
He used to play it right here
If you'd care to buy me a drink.
That takes a man a fool
And then he rocked back on his stool.
He just returned from the Great War
His buddies gave him that guitar
At the time it was simple and plain
He added the gold and the diamonds
As he played his way to fame.
He was doing a show in Shreveport
The night he received a call
The greatest show at all.
I was driving him to Nashville
It was cold and misting rain
The signals flashed and the whistle screamed
I swear Mister I never saw that train.
I heard the doctor tell him
Just after he used his knife
You're lucky son it was just your arm
It could have been your life.
More than he could give
He just lost his will to live.
But this world's loss is heaven's gain
And tonight he's still a star
He plays with a band of angels
Gave me a dark dirty street to roam
Cold anywhere when you sleep on the ground
I'll just sit back and watch you leave it seems you want more that I can give
You don't care how much my heart will grieve
You've got to see how the other half lives
Dim lights and smoke filled crowded bars loud music that plays until all hours
My today's and tomorrows I would give if you'd give up the way the other half lives
Dim lights and smoke...
I'll hush up my mug if you'll just fill up my jug
There's an old holler tree down the road away from me
Where you lay down a dollar or two
Go around the bend then you come back again
And them that refuse it are few
I'll hush up my mug if you'll just fill up my jug
My uncle Mort was sawed off and short
He measured about four foot two
But he thinks he's a giant when you give him a pint
And them that refuse it are few
I'll hush up my mug if you'll just fill up my jug
My brother Bill ran a still on the hill
He'd run off a gallon or two
And them that refuse it are few
I'll hush up my mug if you'll just fill up my jug
Said his wife had been down with the flu
And them that refuse it are few
I'll hush up my mug if you'll just fill up my jug
I stopped at a road house in Texas
A little place called Hamburger Dan's
The waitress then brought me up some coffee
I thanked her then called her back again
I said that old song sure does fit me
Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
Put a nickel in the jukebox
I climbed back aboard my old semi
And then like a flash I was gone
I got them old truck wheels a rolling
Now I'm on my way to San Antone.
When I get my call up to glory
They'll take me away from this land
I'll head this old truck up to heaven
Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
Put a nickel in the jukebox
The one I love don't want me hanging round
All she does is put me on and put me down
Tonight she's with a stranger at a party in her home
Where there's lights and laughter
I'll sober up tomorrow and cry all day I know
I'll dance with all the girls and buy the wine
Play the jukebox till I'm down to my last dime
She thinks she made a fool of me by loving someone else
She should see me make a fool out of myself.
Where there's lights and laughter
I'll sober up tomorrow and cry all day I know
Of a woman who meant everything
So proud he once owned her but he has her no longer
For she wears another man's ring.
He talked of the good time they'd had in the springtime
Before she was stolen away
He blamed her oh no none he said she was too young
And that's why she wanted to stray.
We drank to her new love that it might be true love
Her future both happy and bright
With his eyes growing misty he drank down the whiskey
That was telling his story that night.
And though he didn't even know me he told me all of his story
And not one single word did he say without pride
And then he asked me if I blamed her but oh when he named her
I wanted to run out and hide.
How could I tell him the man that had dealt him
His sadness and sorrow was me
I ran from the table while I was still able
To hold back my own misery.
And now a wonder comes to me that maybe he knew me
And he told me just so I'd cry
But without his knowing my teardrops were flowing
Making paper wads from napkins throwing toothpicks on the floor
Got a problem I can't solve it gonna sit here till I figure out
The reason why my baby doesn't love me anymore
Not since I've been knowing her and that's a long long time
Drank so many cups of coffee bet you that I'll get an ulcer
Overhead the waitress saying I wonder why he don't go home
Guess my baby's out with someone laughing dancing and romancing
Well it can't be another woman...
One to wake me up every morning
One with a buddy at noon.
One for the road every evening
Till I found out pretty soon
It took two to wake me up every morning
Two with my buddy at noon.
Two for the road every evening
Till I guess what happened pretty soon
I had a house on a hillside
The car I was driving was new
I had money in my pockets
Look what liquor led me to.
I started running round with a woman
Turned my back on my wife and my kids
The awful thing that daddy did.
One to wake me up every morning
One with a buddy at noon.
One to wake me up every morning
Such an easy life I never knew since the day that I left you
I'm a carefree lad and I've seen the light
Hi friends this is Bill Anderson
To most of you this is an album of twelve songs
Twelve dreams that all came true.
Because this album contains twelve of the songs
That I've written over the past few years.
States and even around the world have recorded.
And which you'd accepted and turned into hits.
I realize that there's no way for me to capture
The sound and the feeling of these great original recordings
And I won't even attempt to but I would like to present
These songs to you in this album.
From this pen and from me as the only way that I have of
I grew up in a house on Saginaw bay
My daddy was a poor hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many nights he came home with too little pay.
But he called me that son of a Saginaw fisherman
And he said I wasn't good enough to claim his daughter's hand.
But with each new day I pray I'll strike it rich and then
You can tell your dad I'm coming back a richer man
He gave me a great big party and we drank champagne
It serves him right and no one here is missing him
The bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights.
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights.
The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
Did the God who put those stars above make those city lights
Did he make a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
Are we just supposed to run and hide behind those city lights.
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
When you found somebody new I thought I never would
Forget you for I thought then I never could
Once a day all day long and once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish you weren't gone is once a day every day all day long
I'm so glad that I'm not like a man I knew one time
He lost the one he loved then slowly lost his mind
He sat around and cried his life away lucky me I'm only crying once a day
Once a day all day long...
Last night was the worst night of my life no doubt
Cause while I stayed at home someone else took you out
I missed holding hands walking out on your lawn
I missed the sweet kiss that was mine for so long
Were you happy with new arms wrapped around you so tight
Did the neighbors say they noticed anything strange
Like a different car parked in your drive for a change
Did they watch as he kissed you beneath the porch light
I missed holding hands walking out on your lawn
I missed the sweet kiss that was mine for so long
Were you happy with new arms wrapped around you so tight
I get to thinking lots of times about back when I was a lad
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
And come morning Rock of Ages would wake me gently once again
And when daddy would reach up and he'd take the Bible down
And he'd read it read it loud and long
And I always felt that maybe our house was blessed
When daddy would say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess and then Bob and then Tommy and then Dan
By then dad's hair was turning white and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that as daddy's back grew weak my mother's faith just grew strong
And those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
I guess the house is still standing I don't get to go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls and no steps to grace the floor
For you see my mother sings in heaven now around God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this world is a better place
You think about your love affair and wonder what went wrong
You go to bed each night and pray you'll never see the dawn
Afraid of each tomorrow with its heartless cold unknown
And that's what it's like to be lonesome with a heart a broken love taught to cry
You search to find a tavern where the music is playing loud
You try to lose your heartaches in the laughter of the crowd
But the happy couples make you think of things that might have been
And you have to fight the teardrops till you're by yourself again
My life on a Mississippi riverboat
I used to be known from coast to coast
I've dealt the cards from Minnesota
To the harbor at New Orleans
Our last time in St. Paul
And the riverboat won it all.
He said I dealt from the bottom of the deck
And he pulled a shiny knife
But before that gambler lunged at me
Took me to jail when we got to Tennessee
Guess nobody cared for me.
But if I ever get out
I'm gonna head straight for that levee
I reached out my arms and I touched you with soft words I whispered your name
I held you right on the tip of my fingers but that was as close as I came
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands but I let it slip right through my hands
Somebody took you when I wasn't looking and I should have known from the start
It's a long long way from the tip of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart to the love hidden deep in your heart
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
I've enjoyed as much of this as I can stand
You look lovelier tonight than I remember
I'm so glad I got to see you once again
I've enjoyed just sitting down and reminiscing
But I've enjoyed as much of this as I can stand.
So you say you're happy now you've got a new love
Tell him I said he's a lucky lucky man
I've enjoyed as much of this as I can stand.
There's so much more between us than this table
All those years all those dreams all those plans
Guess you know without me saying I still love you
But I've enjoyed as much of this as I can stand.
All those years all those dreams all those plans
Guess you know without me saying I still love you
But I've enjoyed as much of this as I can stand.
On the banks of the river by the railroad track
We kept chickens in a pen in the back
My daddy was a farmer but all he ever raised was us
Salvation Army give us clothes to wear
A man from the county came to cut our hair
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
That was ten dollar less than the landlord wanted for rent
The landlord's letters got nasty indeed
He wrote get out but pa couldn't read
And we was too broke to even pay heed
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
But we had something in our house money can't buy
Kept us warm in the winter cool when the sun was high
For whenever we didn't have food enough
We patched the cracks and set the table with love
I don't love you anymore not the way I did before
And since you've found someone new I think it's best
I don't cry and walk the floor I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore for I've got no more love to give
You drained my heart of all its love with every sweet caress
I keep saying o'er and o'er I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less.
I held you close to me one time kissed your lips and called you mine
Then another came and thrilled you more I guess
I cried as you walked out the door I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less.
I don't love you anymore for I've got no more love to give
You drained my heart of all its love with every sweet caress
I keep saying o'er and o'er I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less.
I've lost count of the hours
And I've lost track of the days
And that's one thing that no one can mar
I don't know who you're with
I don't even know where you've gone
My only hope is that some day you might hear this song
And you'll know that I wrote it especially for you
This flame in my heart is like an eternal fire
For every day it burns hotter
And every day it burns higher
And I haven't been able to put out one little flicker
Not even with all of these tears
My friends think I'm crazy and maybe I am
But I'll carry this torch just as long as I can
And I want you to know
They're not teardrops
They're I love you drops
They were on my pillow when I woke up this morning
They were on the letter I tried all day to write
And just a little while ago I saw them
Falling on your picture as I kissed it goodnight.
You've been gone so long drops.
They're not teardrops
That say I'm lonesome
Never knew this heart could hurt the way it hurts for you
Never lived so many lifetimes in a week
Why don't you come back to me the way you said you would
And kiss these little crystals off my cheek.
You've been gone so long drops.
They're not teardrops
That say I'm lonesome
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep.
I just kissed the one I love for the last time
Never have her soft lips been so sweet
She's gone away and won't be back forever
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep.
I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
I can't stand the thought of life alone without her
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep.
Just before she said goodbye she called me darling
And slowly ran her fingers down my cheek
I thought I'd die when she said she still love me
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep.
I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
I can't stand the thought of life alone without her
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep.
Oh I might as well be talking to the wall
I've known so long with me you've been unsatisfied
So I finally found the strength to set you free
Why already I forgot a million memories and leaving you was easy as could be
But I might as well be talking to the wall when I tell myself I'm not missing you at all
Cause every time you come around I fall and I might as well be talking to the wall
It seems there's not a day that some friend of mine
But I smile and say you know it's been a long long time
And I hardly remember her at all
But I might as well be talking...
I hold her hand much tighter now stars are shining brighter now
And throughout the day I find she's always on my mind
What a wonderful wonderful feeling when liking turns to loving
The tender smiles I used to know now I cherish so
What a wonderful wonderful feeling when liking turns to loving
To me she was always just a little girl and now she's my whole world
Music fills the starlit night when I kiss and hold her tight
And one day just the way we planned she'll wear my wedding band
What a wonderful wonderful feeling when liking turns to loving
What a wonderful wonderful feeling when liking turns to loving
A sense of freedom fills my veins I get the fever
Every time I sparrow flies up into the endless skies
Something down inside me cries I get the fever
I get the fever to pack up and leave here wander wild like the wind
Every time I hear a buddy say he's put lots of dust and clay
Between him and yesterday I get the fever
I get the fever to pack and leave here and I think maybe I'll do just that tomorrow
Everywhere I turn there's pain and sorrow
Every time I hear a buddy say he's put lots of dust and clay
Between him and yesterday I get the fever
People tell me I don't look as good as I used to
And they say I don't act as nice as I used to
But they don't know the heartbreak and the pain I've gone through
I'm not loved by the woman who used to.
Somebody else lives in the same house I used to
And he kisses the same lips I used to
My ex calls him darling and all I can do
Is pretend but there's really no used to
I used to think life was a song
If it is I've been singing it wrong
World please forgive anything I might do
But it's more than my heart can get used to.
In the summertime when all
That's what you say when I want you
Then you laugh at me and make me cry
You don't seem to care a thing
Than to have my arms around you
When the nights are cold and you're so all alone.
In the summertime when all
The trees and leaves are green
Once upon a time you used to
You don't have time for me
You don't seem to care a thing
Than to have my arms around you
When the nights are cold and you're so all alone.
In the summertime when all
The trees and leaves are green
In a barroom in Chicago somewhere after midnight
I'm sitting on a barstool drinking like a fish
And although I just met you I can tell by looking
You're wondering what my problem really is
Next time you're in Tulsa go see Mrs Johnson
And you'll be looking my problem right between the eyes
Loves her still and will until he dies
Walk up to her front door ask to see the children
Take them all some candy and a big kiss from their dad
Tell them how I miss them and I'll be down next winter
But not till then cause now I hurt too bad
I will never be the same
I have fallen in love in the sunshine
Fallen in love in the rain
Love can burn but I'll never learn
I'm falling in love again.
I will never be the same
A promise her sweet lips whispered my name
She leaned in close and gave me one last kiss
And left on the midnight train.
I will never be the same
Fallen in love in the rain
Love can burn but I'll never learn
I'm falling in love again.
I will never be the same
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry.
I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind a cloud
Did you ever hear a robin weep
When leaves began to die
That mean he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry.
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
Nail my shoes to the floor glue my coat to the door
Take my hat throw it far far away
Hide the keys to my car and if I ask you where they are
Don't say a word just nail my shoes to the floor
I've spent the better part of my life walking in and out of doors
I've been a restless reckless run around
Now something tells me you won't let me leave but one time more
So before my feet start walking tie me down
Nail my shoes to the floor...
I guess I really love you and I'd die if we should part
But I'm so weak and so incline to roam
And don't let me go anywhere but home
I was certain you'd always love me
I was certain you'd never change
I gave my love to you completely
I felt so certain of everything.
Seems that's all I know for certain anymore.
Life won't ever be the way it was before
For loving you my life is so much richer
You've given so much to live for
And for loving you my faith is a little stronger
For a world that could give you to me
Couldn't be as bad as it's made out to be
And for needing you I feel a whole lot stronger
For there's a strength that comes
From knowing you need to give up yourself
And now I'm losing you and I'm a sadder lonelier man
Than I ever thought any man could be
The hunting trail of memory.
Even for all the pain that I'm feeling right now
Never once will I ever regret
Having had the chance of loving you.
That's above and beyond
That money can't buy.
For a pretty girl's glances
Are sometimes very few
But if you'll be my honey
Here's what I'll offer you.
That's above and beyond
And I'll never ever make you cry
I'm gonna give you love
That's above and beyond
And love's something that money can't buy.
And I knew at a glance
That I'd found my happiness
So if you wanna carry me off
Then I'll answer yes.
And I'll give you love
That's above and beyond
And I'll never ever make you cry
I'm gonna give you love
That's above and beyond
And love's something that money can't buy.
But for what I am when I'm with you
I love you not only for what you've made of yourself
But for what you're making of me.
And for laying firm hold on the possibilities of a good in me
I love you because you've done more
Than any creed to make me happy
And you've done it without a word.
And you've done it without a touch
Without even a sign you've done it just by being yourself
I don't care what anybody thinks of me
My pride is gone and here I am on bended knee
I only know I need you and I love you so
And I'd fight the world before I'd ever let go go
I'd gladly beg I'd steal I'd borrow I'd turn my back on everyone I know
I'd do these things with no fear of tomorrow
I'd fight the world before I'd ever let go go
But I don't care if the world stops and the sun explodes or the moon turns to ashes
I'd gladly stand and fight the world before I'd let you go
I'd gladly beg I'd steal...
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds because you're mine I walk the line
I find it very very easy to be true I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes I'll admit that I'm a fool for you because you're mine I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right because you're mine I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side you give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide because you're mine I walk the line
I keep a close watch...
Forsaking all others till death do us part
Wherever you go I'll follow and whatever you do
I want to be part of it
Because you're so much a part of me
That I just couldn't live without you.
Forsaking all others for better or worse
I don't even have to think about it
Because no matter how rough it gets along the way
Every step that I take with you is over a mountain of happiness
Or through a valley of golden sunshine
For richer or poorer I'll never be poor
As long as I own your love
Because it's the most priceless possession that I have.
You made me the richest girl in the world
When you gave your heart to me
Every day with you is a heaven on earth
That neither money can buy not poverty take away
I'm yours to hold to keep and to love forever
With every beat of my heart I live only for you.
I shudder to think what might have happened to me if I hadn't met you when I did
My life was just one big mangled mess of mistakes no purpose and no future ahead
And I was as lost as a leaf on a river and as wild as a straw in the wind
But you came along and just by being you made me feel like a woman again
I'll thank God for you
Is to know that there's no one who cares
And then you look up and have you come along
Somebody somewhere surely heard my prayers
Give me your hand now and I want you to hold on real tight
Cause the road might just get a little rough
But we've gonna make it on faith and on love
Have I told you lately that I love you
Could I tell you once again somehow
Have I told with all my heart and soul how I adore you
This world would end today if you refuse me
I'm no good without you anyhow
Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping
Every dream I dream is you somehow
Have I told how all the nights are long when you're not with me
My heart would break in two if I should lose you
I'm no good without you anyhow
Have I told you lately that I love you
By your side satisfied through and through
Wondrously love can see
So I knew that I was born to be with you
Do you find peace of mind
Packed my things and went away a thousand years ago today
For I had places to go and things to see
I had a girl who loved me so and she begged me not to go
But I left and took her pleading words with me.
I love you and I'll miss you while you're gone
I know you have to do what your heart tells you to
So I'll be waiting till it tells you to come home.
All the things I'd hoped to find I soon learned I'd left behind
So I told myself oh boy let's us go home
And the echo of her promise leads me on.
I'll be waiting till your heart tells you come home
For I left here with a smile and now I weep
Still waiting neath the ground where she's asleep
Should you go first and I remain to walk the road alone
I'll live in memory's garden dear with happy days we've known
In spring I'll watch for roses red and shades of lilac blue
In early fall when the brown leaves fall then I'll catch a glimpse of you
Should you go first and I remain to finish with the scroll
We've known so much of happiness yes we've had our cup of joy
And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy
Should you go first and I remain there's one thing I'd have you do
Walk slowly down that long path for soon I'll follow you
I want you to know each step I take so that you may walk the same
For someday down that lonely road you'll hear me call your name
Beyond the sunset oh glad reunion with our dear loved ones who've gone before
Out of your life into a life where I'll be understood
I need a lots of tender love and your heart's made out of wood
You told me that love is one big bubble we played the game by your rules and you won
And just today I figured out the trouble I learned to crawl before I learned to run
But I'm gonna get while...
I noticed I've quit singing in the shower I rarely ever laugh and I can tell
And there's nothing left to say now but farewell
You're gonna know what it means to be lonely
You're gonna know how it feels to feel your heart breaking in two
When the wheel of hurt comes wheeling round to you
You're gonna cry little tears someday maybe
I'll hear you say you're sorry we're through
But I'll be the first one to help you cause you need someone that's true
When the wheel of hurt comes wheeling round to you
You're gonna learn the truth the hard way and when you do you'll always know
It's bad luck to hurt somebody when that somebody loves you so
It may be today or it may be tomorrow you'll have to pay when you're payment is due
And maybe then you'll realize how much pain you've put me through
When the wheel of hurt comes wheeling round to you
How many times have you heard someone say
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
Everything that I dreamed for turned to start in life's game
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind
Money won't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person's a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind
When my life has ended my time has run out
But one thing for certain when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind
Her real first name was Betty
But I'd rather just forget it
So I'll call her the first Mrs. Jones
We were married in September
And it lasted till November
When one day she just took out on her own.
I followed her to Savannah
Then Mobile and then Atlanta
Every day I begged her please come home
Pretty soon I started drinking
Just how much I loved the first Mrs. Jones.
It was cold and dark one morning
Just before the day was dawning
When I staggered from a tavern to a phone
When she picked up her receiver
I said you're gonna come back or either
They're gonna be calling you the late Mrs. Jones.
I put a pistol in my jacket
Stumbled out and hailed a taxi
And everybody said that I yelled out loudly
Come on out or I'm gonna come in Mrs. Jones.
Then next thing I recall
Was walking through the forest
I dug and dug for hours
And then I planted flowers
Right on top of the first Mrs. Jones.
Did my little story scare you
Aren't you sorry now that you left me
Ain't been in Little Rock
But two weeks and here I am now
Packing up and disappearing into thin air
Girls in Little Rock are cute
But I can't make my heart take roots
I need a lots of sunshine
I need a lots of raindrops
I need to breath the open air
I hope to beg your pardon
Your town just ain't my garden
Bad seed won't grow just anywhere.
So honey kiss goodbye to your bad seed
My love is not the kind of love that you need
I could stay here with you but I wouldn't play fair
And you're looking at the baddest of the bad seed.
Next stop Jacksonville now I don't know but I got the feeling
I might just kinda like it somewhere round there
Hear tell there's fertile land white pearly silver sand
And bad seed won't grow just anywhere.
I need a lots of sunshine
I need a lots of raindrops
I need to breath the open air
I hope to beg your pardon
Your town just ain't my garden
Bad seed won't grow just anywhere.
So honey kiss goodbye to your bad seed
My love is not the kind of love that you need
I could stay here with you but I wouldn't play fair
I need a post I can lean on without it falling a rock I can stand on without it rolling
I need a road I can walk down without it turning
A fire I can feel the glow but not the burning
I don't need love just something to believe in
Where are the lips that told me they'd love me forever
The arms that promised me eternal shelter
Where is the wind that lied to me you'll never be empty
For love is a cherry tree in the land of plenty
But I don't want love just something to believe in
I believed in the sunshine and I saw it turned to rain
I believed in the one I loved but I loved her in vain
Is there no post I can lean on without it falling
No rock I can stand on without it rolling
Is there no road I can walk down without it turning
No fire I can feel the glow but not the burning
I don't want love just something to believe in
If you ain't satisfied
If you don't care get on your horse
Since you got on your high horse
New fancy friends you've found
You don't even notice me
You don't look that far down.
If you ain't satisfied
If you don't care get on your horse
You tried to tear me down
If you ain't satisfied
If you don't care get on your horse
I'll have your second fiddle
Returned to you today
I never learned to play.
If you ain't satisfied
If you don't care get on your horse
If you ain't satisfied
If you don't care get on your horse
Then we can buy something to eat before another day is done
The harvest has sure been slow the drought hit us hard this year
But daddy said we'd have to go winter mustn't find us here
So my daddy and my mama and me packed everything we owned
Put it in this old suitcase and left the place that we called home
But we've always been a family with lots of pride
And thankful for everything that we've had
So I know that somehow we're gonna make it
It's gonna take me than this old drought to stop us you'll see
I've got a feeling the grass is gonna be greener for my daddy and my mama and me
My daddy and my mama and me...
Open up your heart and let my love come in
Open up your heart and let my life begin
The sun's gonna shine there'll be blue skies again
When you open up your heart and let my love come in.
I know you've been hurt by an old love affair
But darling don't blame me I wasn't even there
Your long lonely nights I will bring to an end
If you'll open up your heart and let my love come in.
Open up your heart and let my love come in
Open up your heart and let my life begin
The sun's gonna shine there'll be blue skies again
When you open up your heart and let my love come in.
Someone before me has treated you like dirt
Your long lonely nights I will bring to an end
When you open up your heart and let my love come in.
Open up your heart and let my love come in
Open up your heart and let my life begin
The sun's gonna shine there'll be blue skies again
All I do is roam the street
Homesick to be with you.
And I don't know what to do
I'm homesick to be with you.
Little by little I guess
Haven't been home in too long a time.
But I'm gonna be home soon
I'll be home if I have to come in a box
Just plain homesick for you.
I'm so homesick I'm going crazy
And I don't know what to do
Homesick to be with you.
They say I was born with a silver tear in my eye
Must have been I felt the wind that cold November morn
And I knew it would blow me no good from the day I was born.
I was born at an early age and that's when I'll die
You've seen to that by loving then saying goodbye
You held me near then left me here forsaken and forlorn
Some loves come up roses but my love came up thorns
Some loves come up roses but my love came up thorns
Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
I want to know you still remember me
The sweetest songs belong to lovers in the gloaming
The sweetest days are the days that used to be
The saddest words I've ever heard were words of parting
When you said sweetheart remember me.
Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
It would be so sweet when all alone
I'm dreaming just to know you still remember me.
You told me once that you'd be mine alone forever
And I was yours till the end of eternity
But all those vows are broken now
And we will never be the same except in memory.
Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
It would be so sweet when all alone
I'm dreaming just to know you still remember me.
A sense of freedom fills my veins I get the fever
Every time I sparrow flies up into the endless skies
Something down inside me cries I get the fever
I get the fever to pack up and leave here wander wild like the wind
Every time I hear a buddy say he's put lots of dust and clay
Between him and yesterday I get the fever
I get the fever to pack and leave here and I think maybe I'll do just that tomorrow
Everywhere I turn there's pain and sorrow
Every time I hear a buddy say he's put lots of dust and clay
Between him and yesterday I get the fever
I reached out my arms and I touched you with soft words I whispered your name
I held you right on the tip of my fingers but that was as close as I came
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands but I let it slip right through my hands
Somebody took you when I wasn't looking and I should have known from the start
It's a long long way from the tip of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart to the love hidden deep in your heart
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
I love those bright lights and country music
I won't stay home and cry tonight like all the nights before
I've just learned that I don't really need you anymore
I found a little place downtown where guys like me can go
And they've got bright lights and country music
Bright lights and country music a bottle and a glass
Soon I'll be forgetting that there ever was a past
And when everybody asks me what helped me forget so fast
I'll say bright lights and country music
A table by the bandstand a bottle filled with wine
Honky tonks were made for men with women on their minds
Nothing else can take away this loneliness of mine
Quite like bright lights and country music
Bright lights and country music...
I get to thinking lots of times about back when I was a lad
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
And come morning Rock of Ages would wake me gently once again
And when daddy would reach up and he'd take the Bible down
And he'd read it read it loud and long
And I always felt that maybe our house was blessed
When daddy would say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess and then Bob and then Tommy and then Dan
By then dad's hair was turning white and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that as daddy's back grew weak my mother's faith just grew strong
And those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
I guess the house is still standing I don't get to go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls and no steps to grace the floor
For you see my mother sings in heaven now around God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this world is a better place
If it's true what you say in your letter
If your sweet love for me is really gone
If there's somebody else that you love better
Ain't no future in the past. broken hearts and all that jazz
So you took my photograph from your locket
And replaced it with the one you love the best
Give me back my ring and I'll go hock it
What's one little diamond more or less.
Ain't no future in the past. broken hearts and all that jazz
Ain't no future in the past. broken hearts and all that jazz
I've lost count of the hours
And I've lost track of the days
And that's one thing that no one can mar
I don't know who you're with
I don't even know where you've gone
My only hope is that some day you might hear this song
And you'll know that I wrote it especially for you
This flame in my heart is like an eternal fire
For every day it burns hotter
And every day it burns higher
And I haven't been able to put out one little flicker
Not even with all of these tears
My friends think I'm crazy and maybe I am
But I'll carry this torch just as long as I can
And I want you to know
They're not teardrops
They're I love you drops
They were on my pillow when I woke up this morning
They were on the letter I tried all day to write
And just a little while ago I saw them
Falling on your picture as I kissed it goodnight.
You've been gone so long drops.
They're not teardrops
That say I'm lonesome
Never knew this heart could hurt the way it hurts for you
Never lived so many lifetimes in a week
Why don't you come back to me the way you said you would
And kiss these little crystals off my cheek.
You've been gone so long drops.
They're not teardrops
That say I'm lonesome
All that's left of all our love now
My lonely world is only eight by ten eight by ten eight by ten
I remember the night that you gave me that picture I ought to
I've relived it so many times I remember how I couldn't wait to get home
Put it in a frame and tell everybody that you were mine.
Because you were mine at least until someone else came along
And took you off out of my sight
It's a good thing that you did leave me your picture to hold
Because now I can cry on your shoulder every night.
My lonely world is only eight by ten.
It's awful to be jealous of an old picture frame
But I'm jealous of anything that's close to you
And that picture frame seems to be holding you pretty tight
That looks like more than I'll ever do.
I wish that I could just be the glass in that frame
And be so close to the lips that I love
I am glad that I've at least got your picture to hold
But sometimes it's just not enough
On the banks of the river by the railroad track
We kept chickens in a pen in the back
My daddy was a farmer but all he ever raised was us
Salvation Army give us clothes to wear
A man from the county came to cut our hair
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
That was ten dollar less than the landlord wanted for rent
The landlord's letters got nasty indeed
He wrote get out but pa couldn't read
And we was too broke to even pay heed
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
But we had something in our house money can't buy
Kept us warm in the winter cool when the sun was high
For whenever we didn't have food enough
We patched the cracks and set the table with love
I came home last night to a dark and lonely cottage
I took the wreath off the door and somehow I stumbled inside
I just can't I just can't I said live without her
Give me one reason to live now that my darling has died.
And then five little fingers
Too young to understand.
And there was a softness in my little girl's touch
That seemed to say daddy I need you so
And in five little seconds her five little fingers
Told me all that I wanted to know.
I could tell her little eyes were full of questions
I tried to answer but all I could do was hold her tight
Forgive me forgive me I said for crying
But darling your daddy has got such a load on his shoulders tonight.
And then five little fingers
Touched me on the cheek
And gently brushed away a tear.
And I knew that in her own little way
My baby was saying daddy I love you so
It only took five little seconds for her five little fingers
To tell me all that I needed to know.
And you're saying what a crazy fool I am
But the one I love is out tonight with him
I need a drink but all the bars are locked up tight
A lonely man gets mighty thirsty late at night
There's the river here's the bridge it's too late now
I've got nothing left to live for anyhow
In the news they'll say he couldn't even swim
I happened to walk into a honky tonk
One night down in New Orleans
Up above the bar hung a big guitar
Like none I'd ever seen.
The neck was set with diamonds
And though the strings were old
Like Kings of sound they wound around
Six keys of solid gold.
A man stepped up beside me
His breath was strong with wine
He said you know that guitar once belonged
To a mighty close pal of mine.
He used to play it right here
If you'd care to buy me a drink.
That takes a man a fool
And then he rocked back on his stool.
He just returned from the Great War
His buddies gave him that guitar
At the time it was simple and plain
He added the gold and the diamonds
As he played his way to fame.
He was doing a show in Shreveport
The night he received a call
The greatest show at all.
I was driving him to Nashville
It was cold and misting rain
The signals flashed and the whistle screamed
I swear Mister I never saw that train.
I heard the doctor tell him
Just after he used his knife
You're lucky son it was just your arm
It could have been your life.
More than he could give
He just lost his will to live.
But this world's loss is heaven's gain
And tonight he's still a star
He plays with a band of angels
I plowed the fields and I planted the seed
I worked my hands to the bone
But the ground laid barren till He sent the sunshine
For I can do nothing alone.
I raised the corn and I rode to the mill
With the best crop I ever had grown
But the wheel wouldn't grind till He stirred the waters
For I can do nothing alone.
I can do nothing alone
I'm weak and my Master is strong
I held the pencil but He wrote this song
For I can do nothing alone.
And now as my years lead me into the valley
I've asked Him to please come home
For I walk in search of the good life hereafter
And I can do nothing alone.
I can do nothing alone
I'm weak and my Master is strong
I held the pencil but He wrote this song
Standing on the promises of Christ my King
Through eternal ages let His praises ring
Standing on the promises of God my Saviour
Standing standing I'm standing on the promises of God
Standing on the promises that cannot fail
Though the howling storm of doubt and fear assail
By the living word of God I shall prevail standing on the promises of God
Standing on the promises I cannot fall listening every moment to the spirits call
Resting in my Saviour as my all in all standing on the promises of God
My latest sun is sinking fast
My race is nearly run
My strongest trials now are past
Come and around me stand
Bear me away on your snowy wings
I've almost gained my heavenly home
My spirit loudly sing
The holy ones behold they come
I hear the noise of wings.
Come and around me stand
Bear me away on your snowy wings
Papa was a simple man
Papa loved his farming land
Guess I didn't understand
Please forgive me papa.
You can't paint a picture of a man like papa
With something as empty as words
The toughness of timber
And compare it to the softness of birds.
Papa was both and yet he was neither
Just a hard working God fearing soul
He gave what he had to the ones that he loved
And I guess he loved me best of all.
For I was the oldest and we were the closest
We worked that old farm side by side
I guess that's the reason it hit me the hardest
The morning that my papa died.
All I could think of was how hard he'd worked
And what little comfort he'd found
I guess that's the reason I hitched up the mule
And drove the old buggy to town.
I picked out a lot in the big cemetery
In the shade of a tall maple tree
Figured it's the least I could do for my papa
After all the things that he's done for me.
We gave him a funeral fit for a king
And then we laid him to rest in the sod
Somehow I thought that in that big pretty place
He just might feel closer to God.
The women were crying as they passed by papa
The men stopped and all shook my hand
Most of the mourners had gone when I looked up
And noticed this white haired old man.
He was dressed kinda shabby and he walked with a cane
His voice was shaky and low
He used to work for us a long time ago.
They told me this morning that the big boss had died
And I thought that I should come around
They told me that you done brought him to town.
I remember your papa used to say that when he died
He didn't have but one request
He wanted to be buried out dare on that farm
Found me an old paper sack
I scooped up some dirt from up near the farmhouse
And thought that I'd just bring it back.
I hope you don't mind if I just sorta scatter these
Few little pieces of clay
It ain't gonna mess up your pretty green grass
He just might sleep better this way.
Let me be a little kinder let me be a little blinder
To the faults of those about me let me praise a little more
Let me be when I am weary just a little bit more cheery
Think a little more of others and a little less of me
Let me be a little braver when temptation bits me waver
Let me strive a little harder to be all that I should be
Let me be a little meeker with the brother who is weaker
Think a little more of others and a little less of me
Let me be when I am weary just a little bit more cheery
Let me serve a little better those that I am striving for
Let me be a little meeker with the brother who is weaker
Think a little more of others and a little less of me
I can hear my Saviour calling
I can hear my Saviour calling
I can hear my Saviour calling
Where He leads me I will follow
Where He leads me I will follow
Where He leads me I will follow
I'll go with Him with Him all the way.
I'll go with Him through the garden
I'll go with Him through the garden
I'll go with Him through the garden
I'll go with Him with Him all the way.
Where He leads me I will follow
Where He leads me I will follow
Where He leads me I will follow
Just as I am without one plea but that Thy blood was shed for me
Just as I am and waiting not to rid my soul of one dark blot
To Thee who's blood can cleanse each spot oh lamb of God I come I come
Just as I am Thou tossed about with many a conflict and many a doubt
Fightings within and fears without oh lamb of God I come I come
Just as I am Thou wilt receive will dwell come pardon cleanse relieve
It's as dark as the night but my eyes see a light just down by the river side
There's a light at the river a light at the river a light at the river I can see
My Lord will stand and hold in his hand a light at the river for me
To this deep silent river I have come on my knees I'm afraid for I know I've sinned
But the beckoning light leads me on through the night
To the waters where my soul may be cleansed
There's a light at the river...
Then we'll pass o'er deep and you'll never more weep in your home on the other side
There's a light at the river...
Sometimes I wonder when things go so wrong
And then I remember through trials of distress
I asked for strength that I might achieve
I was given weakness that I might learn humbly to obey
I asked for health that I might do great things
I was given informality that I might do better things.
I asked for riches that I might be happy
I was given poverty that I might be wise
I asked for power that I might have the praise of men
I was made weak that I might feel the need of God.
I asked for all things that I might enjoy life
I was given life that I might enjoy all things
I got nothing that I asked for but everything that I hoped for
And then I remember through trials and distress
I walked one day along a country road
And there a stranger journeyed too
Bent low beneath the burden of his load
Take up Thy cross and follow me
I hear the blessed Saviour call
How can I make a lesser sacrifice
When Jesus gave his all.
I saw His hands all bruised and torn
I stooped to kiss away the marks of shame
The shame for me that He had born.
Take up Thy cross and follow me
I hear the blessed Saviour call
How can I make a lesser sacrifice
I've just been to heaven with someone so true
I dreamed about mama last night
She read me her Bible like she used to do
I dreamed about mama last night.
Mama used to never go to sleep at night
Until all of us were in bed
On party nights till we come home
She often sat up and read.
We little thought about it then
For we were young and gay
Just how much mama worried when
We only knew that she never slept
When we were out at night
That she waited just to know that we
Were all gonna come home alright.
Why sometimes we'd stayed away
Till one or two or three
And I used to think that mama could hear
The turning of the key.
For we'd step inside and she'd cal
But we were all too young back then
To understand just why.
But up until the last one had returned
Mama always kept a light
She couldn't go to sleep until
She kissed us all goodnight.
I think mama just had to know that we were safe
Before she went to rest
She seemed to fear that the world might harm
The ones that she loved the best.
One time she told me when you're grown
I'll sleep the whole night through
I bet I'll be different then.
And so it seemed that night and day
We knew a mother's care
Then always when we got back home
We'd find her waiting there.
And then came the night that we
Were called together round her bed
The kindly doctor said.
And in her eyes there gleamed again
That old time tender light
To know that we were all alright.
She smiled that old familiar smile
And prayed to God to keep
Her children safe from harm throughout the years
Then mama went to sleep.
My dream is a treasure that I'll always keep
Praising my Saviour all the day long
Praising my Saviour all the day long.
Praising my Saviour all the day long
Praising my Saviour all the day long.
I in my Saviour am happy and blessed
Praising my Saviour all the day long
Wanna be back in Tennessee
Way down in Columbus Stockade
Friends have turned their backs on me.
Never let me cross your mind
In your heart you love another
Last night as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I woke I was mistaken
I was peeping through the bars.
Never let me cross your mind
In your heart you love another
As long as I live if it be one hour or if it be one hundred years
I'll keep remembering forever and ever I'll love you dear as long as I live
It was easy said the night we parted that we'd forget we'd ever met
I haven't forgotten I wonder if you have or if your heart is full of regret
I never thought the night we parted that life without you could be so bad
I know it sounds funny but I can't forget you the only happiness I've ever had
My mama always told me better
Than to play with a loaded gun
Never had a prisoner for a son.
The picture's still in front of my eyes
When the jury said he's guilty
The sunrise over that some old sea
An empty cell for company.
Yet there's not very much that stands between
Me and the freedom I hold dear
I kissed my darling on her tender lips
And they took me by the hand
I had a nice little ride on a ferry boat
To the rock where the prison stands.
The warden said as he locked the door
I hope you'll like it here
Just make yourself a home
I've almost forgotten what my real name is
Been a number for so long
Making little bitty rocks out of great big rocks
Gets old as the days wear on.
Just try to stay alive
The sunrise over that some old sea
An empty cell for company.
Yet there's not very much that stands between
Me and the freedom I hold dear
I'd rather live a life of lies and fantasy
Than face the truth and realize you're leaving me
You built me up so high my heart can't stand the fall
And life without you love just isn't life at all.
So walk out backwards if you must go
And please don't wave goodbye
Just wave one last hello
The truth won't hurt so much
If I can't just pretend
So walk out backwards and
I'll think you're walking in.
You walked into my heart in search of sympathy
From that day down to this you've walked all over me
And now you're walking out to love somebody new
But you're not by yourself cause my heart's leaving too.
So walk out backwards if you must go
And please don't wave goodbye
Just wave one last hello
The truth won't hurt so much
If I can't just pretend
So walk out backwards and
And she's gone gone gone and she's gone gone gone and I'll bid her my last farewell
I fell in love with a pretty little thing I thought that wedding bells would ring
She was as sweet as she could be till I found out what she did to me
Railroad steamboat...
Now I won't cry my life away some other sucker will have to pay
And when he finds that she is gone I bet I'll hear him sing this song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long.
The one I love she's on that train and gone.
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long.
I went across the river to lay me down to sleep
I went across the river to lay me down to sleep
I went across the river gonna me down to sleep
I woke up and I had shackles on my feet.
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long.
I asked the judge what's gonna be my fine
I asked the judge what's gonna be my fine
I said old judge what's gonna be my fine
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
When I stood on the top of a high high mountain
And watched the sun rise in the dawn
I walked by aside a cold cold river and heard the nightingale song
I once saw the king of a mighty nation the princess and I had a conversation
But the great big thrill of my whole life was falling in love with you
Spent a night just a looking at a high high heaven and marvel that God's mighty hand
I tremble like a baby when I see a snowfall
But the great big thrill of my whole life was falling in love with you
Through the small port window of a big main whiner I watched the cities rush by
Well I walked by myself in the low low valley that every man could do
But the great big thrill of my whole life was falling in love with you
Well I walked by myself in the low low valley that every man could do
In the twilight glow I see her blue eyes crying in the rain
As we kissed goodbye and parted I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dying ember only memories remain
Through the ages I'll remember blue eyes crying in the rain
Now my hair has turned to silver all my life I've loved in vain
I can see her star in heaven blue eyes crying in the rain
Some day when we meet up yonder we'll stroll hand in hand again
Just because my love has gone
Don't think my life would still go on
Because she wanted to have her fling
It's not the end of everything
The world still turns the sun still shines
There's plenty of girls for hearts like mine
One never knows what tomorrow might bring
It's not the end of everything
Just look at the things I still possess
Like a heart that's filled with emptiness
A life of pure unhappiness
Two arms that hold just loneliness
My rooms overflow with blue blue songs
I think of the nights I can spend all alone
And all of the days I can just sit and dream
I have the invitation that you sent me
You wanted me to see you change your name
I couldn't stand to see you wed another
I hope that you'll be happy just the same.
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
That should be ringing now for you and me
And down the aisle with someone else you're walking
Those wedding bells will never ring for me.
I planned a little cottage in the valley
I even bought a little band of gold
I hope someday to place it on your finger
But now the future looks so dark and cold.
I fancy that I see a bunch of roses
A blossom from an orange tree in your hair
And as the organ plays I'll love you truly
Just let me pretend that I am there.
As the angel chorus sweetly sings
But as long as I am on this earth dear
Maybe I don't love you quite as much as I believe I love you baby
Maybe I don't need you quite as much as I profess to need you baby
And who's to say anyway that love is not a game we play
As long as I feel warm inside wanted filled and satisfied
Maybe I just gotta have somebody and you're close and you're somebody
But don't leave me you've put me in a happy state of mind
And who's to say anyway...
I've been walked on looked through laughed at lied to
But I still believe in love believe it or not
I've been pushed aside unsatisfied I've tried and I've cried
I've given and I've taken and I've hurt an awful lot
But I still believe in love believe it or not
I still believe that somewhere there's a woman I can gently put my arms around
And kiss her lips and thrill her
When I tell her she's the greatest thing I've ever found
I still believe that I can offer some girl something she has never known before
But she's been searching for
I've been walked on looked through laughed at lied to
I've given and I've taken and I've hurt an awful lot
But I still believe in love believe it or not
I've been walked on...
Just for you just for you that's why I say the things I say and I do the things I do
No one else can make my arms feel like they're wrapped around the world
Each day I wake up with a kiss just for you
And I count my many blessings and I thank the Lord for you
And each minute of the day I live a dream that has come true
Yes I live my life just for you
Just for you just for you...
Cause your love takes good care of me yes your love takes good care of me
And when the rain falls and the wind blows and the storm is on the sea
I'll be safe your love takes care of me
When life for me gets weary and the sun refuses to shine
I run to the arms of the one I love and there I hide
You know just what to do and say you make my life worthwhile
And when I look into your face I see heaven in your smile
And your love takes...
Time's been good to me time took your memory
Erased it slow but well now I can almost tell
The fire that used to burn is gone and won't return
I'm close to victory time's been good to me
They all told me that time would only fan the flame
Each minute without you I'd love you more
And for a while I dreaded each new day that came
Afraid of what the future held in store
But time's been good to me...
It's so nice to meet an old friend
And pass the time of day
And talk about the hometown
A million miles away.
Is the ice still on the river
Are the old folks still the same
And when the morning came
Do they still win all their games
Is the landlord still a loser
Do his signs hang in the hall
Are the young girls still as pretty
Does the laughter on their faces
Still put the sun to shame
Did she mention my name just in passing
And when the talk ran high
Aid the look in her eyes seem far away
Won't you say hello for someone
There'll be no need to explain
A long time ago when the earth was green
Why there was more kinda animals than you've ever seen
And loveliest of them all was the unicorn.
There was green alligators and long neck geese
Some cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born
The loveliest of all was the unicorn
He said hey brother Noah I'll tell you what to do
And take some green alligators and long neck geese
Some cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born
Don't you forget my unicorn.
He marched in the animals two by two
And he called out as they went through.
Some cats and rats and elephants
And then Noah looked out through the driving rain
Green alligators and long neck geese
The unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried
And that's why you've never seen a unicorn to this very day.
You'll see green alligators and long neck geese
Some cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I've cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And that crying time for me had just begun.
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
All day long there's been water on my face
All day long the phone ain't rung the door ain't knocked
And the mail ain't come
And I'm the biggest bum is the human race.
But tomorrow's gonna be better than today
Winds of love gonna blow the lonely clouds away
I'm gonna find me someone new
I'm gonna wash my brain of you.
Tomorrow's gonna be better than today.
Ain't no man ever missed a woman quite so strong
Flipped his lid the way I did and carried on
Beat my fist on the bedroom wall
Shook the plaster loose in the hall
And the reason for it all my baby's gone.
But tomorrow's gonna be better than today
Winds of love gonna blow the lonely clouds away
I'm gonna find me someone new
I'm gonna wash my brain of you.
Tomorrow's gonna be better than today.
Swear to the world I ain't gonna catch me no more blues
I'm gonna sing like a mockingbird happy love in every word
Forget I ever heard your bad bad news.
And tomorrow's gonna be better than today
Winds of love gonna blow the lonely clouds away
I'm gonna find me someone new
I'm gonna wash my brain of you.
Tomorrow's gonna be better than today.
Yes tomorrow's gonna be better than today
Winds of love gonna blow the lonely clouds away
I'm gonna find me someone new
I'm gonna wash my brain of you.
I've tried to forget you by running and hiding
Burning down bridges and closing off doors
I guess it just took me a long time deciding
Part of my heart will always be yours.
My footsteps have wandered over mountains and valleys
My eyes have awakened on far distant shores
But nowhere on earth am I happy without you
Part of my heart will always be yours.
I know now I'll never erase you completely
I feel like a soldier returned from the wars
I fought a good fight but I loved you too deeply
And part of my heart will always be yours.
Our love was a flame once but now it's an ember
My heart has no strength left for you were its source
Wherever you wake up tomorrow remember
It just don't take me long to say goodbye
I told you when I met you not to put your chain of love on me too tight
Or you'd look up and find me slipping out into the freedom of the night
I didn't mean to hurt you babe I think you know I ain't that kinda guy
But it just don't take me long to say goodbye
It just don't take me long to change my shirt and call a cab and catch a train
There ain't nothing we can talk about and baby I've got nothing to explain
All I'm taking is my body so don't ever say I left you high and dry
And I know I'm going home.
And I know I'm going home.
For the folks at home
Hollies in the window
Home where the wind blows
And I know I'm going home.
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing dear if you're not here with me.
I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
I'll have a blue Christmas I know dear
I hope your white Christmas bring you cheer
And when you kneel to say your prayers on this Christmas Eve
I wonder if you'll feel the same as when you prayed with me.
And when those blue snowflakes start falling
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
Who's naughty and nice
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake.
With a little tin horn
And a little toy drum
All around the Christmas tree.
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear.
It's Christmas time in the city
Soon it will be Christmas Day.
Strings of street lights even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you hear.
It's Christmas time in the city
Soon it will be Christmas Day.
I guess I learned to take it for most of the year
But every December when Christmas drew near
Little toy trains and little toy boats
We all sat down and wrote Santa a note
We never heard the jingle of the jingle bells
And if we had Christmas well we just made it ourselves.
Daddy took a hatchet and daddy chopped a pine tree down
The only decorations were the ones we made or found
Brother saw some holly in the rich man's yard
He picked it up fast and ran home hard
And mama knew he stole it but bless her heart
I remember one Christmas it was blowing
Some ladies from the church brought a basket of food
Mama kinda smiled and she said that's good
But why don't you all just take it to the folks
That live down the road
She only kept a chicken and enough
To make some homemade bread
From the blessings that my daddy said
And later when kids was tucked in tight
He made a passel of us
My Christmas list grows shorter every year
Things just aren't the way they were before
My Christmas list grows shorter every year
It's almost not like Christmas anymore.
Christmas was always a big happy time
Course most of the presents just came from the five and dime.
Everybody at my house used to laugh and said that I was born
With a little too much of the spirit of Christmas in me.
And it seemed then that things started to change
Christmases seem sorta strange.
Sister ran off with some weird kinda guy
I never did understand him too much
My kid brother's off somewhere in the service
And he never was the kind to stay in touch.
Course I started my own family a few years ago
My wife and I had two of the cutest little girls
I bought them just about everything in the whole wide world.
And I remember on the Christmas Eve night
And I told them the story of Jesus
And the Santa Claus and the eight tiny reindeer
All I wish now is the spirit of Christmas
Could have lingered throughout the whole year.
You see my wife left me back in September
The kids are with her I don't know where
I'd love to just send them a small Christmas card
To let them know that daddy does care.
And your heart with the ones that you love the best
I don't even have one single address.
My Christmas list grows shorter every year
My Christmas list grows shorter every year
O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
And it came to pass in those days that there went out
And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth
To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child
And so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished
And she brought forth her firstborn son
And wrapped him in swaddling clothes
And laid him in a manger because there
Was no room for them in the inn.
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.
And there were in the same country
Shepherds abiding in the field
Keeping watch over their flock by night
And to the angel of the Lord came upon them
And the glory of the Lord shone round about them
And they were sore afraid
And the angel said unto them fear not for behold
I bring you good tidings of great joy
Which shall be to all people
For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour
Which is Christ the Lord and this shall be a sign unto you
Ye shell find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger
And suddenly there was with the angel
A multitude of the heavenly host
Praising God and saying glory to God
Joy to the world the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing.
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God in sinners reconcile.
Join the trail of the skies
Christ is born in Bethlehem.
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
O come all ye faithful
Born to King of angels
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
The son of a simple pleasant woman
He grew up in another small town
And worked with his father in a carpenter shop
And then for three years he was
What we would call a traveling preacher
He never did any of the things
That one usually associates with greatness
He had no credentials but himself
When he was only thirty three
The tide of public opinion turned against him
Some of his friends deserted him
And turned him over to his enemies
He went through the mockery of a trial
He was nailed to a cross between two thieves
While he was dying his executioners gambled
When he was dead he was taken from the cross
And laid in a borrowed grave
Provided through the compassion of a friend
Nineteen wide centuries have since come and gone
And today this man is the centerpiece of the human race
I think that I am well within the mark when I say
All the armies that ever marched
All the navies that ever sailed the seven seas
All the legislative bodies that ever met
Have not effected the life of man on this earth
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
You don't understand the pattern of my life
Because my life has got no pattern
You don't see and you can't feel the wind
That's blowing at my back and saying move boy
You think this burning fever in my heart is just a folly
I've tried my best to plant my feet and stay with you
But all I feel is roots grow
And what man wants a woman who won't satisfy his heart
I sleep all day and run all night
And you tell me that that ain't right
That ain't what the husbands of your friends do
You try to make me think my nonconforming life
Has colored me some evil shade
You delight and filling up my mind
Well I'm tired of feeling guilty and I'm tired of having nothing
I've tried my best to plant my feet and stay with you
But all I feel is roots grow
And what man wants a woman who won't satisfy his heart
I sleep all day and run all night
And you tell me that that ain't right
That ain't what the husbands of your friends do
This is my destiny to be alone
I know you meant for me to be alone.
You left me to be alone
But there's one thing that you didn't count on
Something far beyond your imagination
And I received a much
Much deeper consolation.
And now I share a greater love
You see it's not so bad for me to be alone
With my head bowed down on my knees
And He dried my tears
That He'd forever be at my side.
He'll be my friend beyond eternity
So they wile away the hours
In their ivory towers
Till they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine.
And the games people play.
Break a heart then we say goodbye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die
That the other one's to blame.
But neither one will ever give in
So we gaze at an eight by ten
And it's a dirty rotten shame.
And the games people play.
Singing glory hallelujah
In the name of the Lord.
They're gonna teach you how to meditate
Read your horoscope and cheat your fate
And furthermore to hell with hate
Come on and get on board.
And the games people play.
Look around and tell me what you see
What's happened to you and me
God grant me the serenity
To just remember who I am.
For your pride and your vanity
Turn your back on humanity
And the games people play.
With the candle light
Besides I don't want to touch that part of life
The days the world belonged to us just us
And I'd telephone at three in the morning
And all sleepy eyed you breathed and sighed
And sometimes we just talked for hours
Dreaming dreams and building towers
All the world was filled with flowers for us
And I'm gonna miss you for a long long time
I can't ever go back to the cabin there
Where I built a fire and held you close
While it snowed outside
And remember you let me sleep all day
So we could love the night away
Oh it just find yesterday and us
I've tried making new friends
Walking new streets and finding new thrills
But nothing new replaces you and it never will
I'll just live my life in memory grateful you once loved me
Thankful that there used to be an us
In the fury of the moment
When my mind was filled with questions
And my head was filled with doubt
I can still see all the sadness
And the sorrow in your eyes
How can flowers live in darkness
For the blackness I've created
In the world that used to shine
I've wilted all the roses
And I've spoiled all the wine.
Get out your magic pencil
And erase the cloudy skies
Give me back the words
See the sunlight reappearing
Through the shrouds of darkened gloom
As I hear your words forgiving me
And watch the flowers bloom.
Have your arms refused to open
Have you served all your ties
I'd still be on my knees
Give me back the words
A canvas covered cabin in a crowded labor camp
And tried to feed my mama's hungry eyes.
He dreamed of something better and my mama's faith was strong
And us kids were just too young to realize
That another class of people put us somewhere just below
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes.
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted
She only wanted things she really needed
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes.
I remember daddy praying for a better way of life
But I don't recall a change of any size
Just a little loss of courage as their age began to show
And one more sadness in my mama's hungry eyes.
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted
She only wanted things she really needed
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes.
Now the morning sun streaks across my room
And I'm wakened up from another dream of you
All I've left behind is a chain of broken dreams.
How I wish this love was all we'd need to live
And it seems so wrong deep inside my heart
That the dollar sign should be keeping us apart.
If only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life had not yet crossed our minds
For the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you.
But you know we can't live on dreams alone
Got to pay the rent got to leave you all alone
But you know I made my choice many years ago
Now this traveling life is the only life I know.
There hang pictures of love and of passion and there's pictures of sorrow and strife
There hang pictures of youth and of beauty of old age and a blushing young bride
But the saddest of all that hang on the wall are the pictures from life's other side
Just a picture from life's other side someone has fell by the way
A life has gone out with the tide that might have been happy some day
There's a poor old mother at home who's watching and waiting alone
Just longing to hear from a loved one so dear it's a picture from life's other side
Now the first scene is that of a gambler who's lost all his money at play
And he reaches down and takes his dead mother's ring from her finger
The one that she wore long ago on her wedding day
It's his last earthly treasure but he stakes it
Then bows his head that his shame he might hide
When they lifted his head they found he was dead
It's just a picture from life's other side
Now the last scene is that by the river of a heartbroken mother and babe
As the harbor lights shine and they shiver on an outcast whom that no one can save
And yet she was once a true woman she was somebody's darling and pride
Every time it rains Lord I run to my window
All I do is ring my hands and moan
Listen to that thunder roll
And hear that lonesome wind blow.
Tell me baby why you been gone so long
Tell me baby why you been gone so long
You been gone so long now
Wolf is scratching at my door
And I can hear that lonesome wind moan
Tell me baby why you been gone so long.
Someone said they thought they saw
With a big oil man from San Antone
They tell me I'm a fool to pine for you
But what do they know
Tell me baby why you been gone so long.
Tell me baby why you been gone so long
Tell me baby why you been gone so long
You been gone so long now
Tell me baby why you been gone so long
Tell me baby why you been gone so long
You been gone so long now
May the fruit of my toil be yours love
May the food from my soil be yours love
And from this moment on may a love true and strong
That lives on and on be yours love.
May the sons that I raise be yours love
May the comforts I praise be yours love
If I ever get weak may the love words I speak
And the arms that I seek be yours love.
May the Lord's shining grace be yours love
May the happiest face be yours love
May the last fingertips that touch these two lips
I am a soldier I'm a slave of power
Power so great that it can destroy
God's world with one mighty blast
Programed to reap destruction wherever I go
I'm a bad risk for my credit is only backed
Up by the United States Government
I'm a killer paid and trained
To hit first before being hit and I do
I'm a soldier so who cares how dirty the job is
If it has to be done then it's done
Right but I'm also a human being
I am myself good or bad
I smell the flowers in the spring
I hear the birds sing in the early morning
I feel the warmth of a fire in the winter
And I feel the rain as it moistens my brow
I'm a part of family with God as my father
I have wants and needs and I have the strength
And the faith to fulfill them
That brings forth a love so great
Or no other being could ever destroy
I'm a human being and I feel
I feel the things all around me
I'm also an American and I'm proud
I'm proud because I have the right
To worship God as my Master
Without the fear of political reprisal
To listen to the Star Spangled Banner
The right to feel a chill throughout my entire body
I have the right to defend
To the great ones who've come
Because I'm an American
And because I'm an American I can also cry
I can cry for my lost brother
Who died defending our way of life
I am an American and I'm proud
I love those bright lights and country music
I won't stay home and cry tonight like all the nights before
I've just learned that I don't really need you anymore
I found a little place downtown where guys like me can go
And they've got bright lights and country music
Bright lights and country music a bottle and a glass
Soon I'll be forgetting that there ever was a past
And when everybody asks me what helped me forget so fast
I'll say bright lights and country music
A table by the bandstand a bottle filled with wine
Honky tonks were made for men with women on their minds
Nothing else can take away this loneliness of mine
Quite like bright lights and country music
Bright lights and country music...
You've cried the last tear you're gonna cry
You've kissed your last lips that cheat and lie
Your heartache's over it's all gone
I'll make you happy from now on
And no one's gonna hurt you anymore.
But give me a while and I'll make you smile
For the times he's made you sad
You've cried the last tear you're gonna cry
You've kissed your last lips that cheat and lie.
Cling to me and I'll kiss away all of your tears.
Here in my arms you'll be safe from harm
Now and for all the coming years
Your heartache's over it's all gone
I'll make you happy from now on.
No one's gonna hurt you anymore.
A sense of freedom fills my veins I get the fever
Every time I sparrow flies up into the endless skies
Something down inside me cries I get the fever
I get the fever to pack up and leave here wander wild like the wind
Every time I hear a buddy say he's put lots of dust and clay
Between him and yesterday I get the fever
I get the fever to pack and leave here and I think maybe I'll do just that tomorrow
Everywhere I turn there's pain and sorrow
Every time I hear a buddy say he's put lots of dust and clay
Between him and yesterday I get the fever
I get to thinking lots of times about back when I was a lad
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
And come morning Rock of Ages would wake me gently once again
And when daddy would reach up and he'd take the Bible down
And he'd read it read it loud and long
And I always felt that maybe our house was blessed
When daddy would say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess and then Bob and then Tommy and then Dan
By then dad's hair was turning white and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that as daddy's back grew weak my mother's faith just grew strong
And those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
I guess the house is still standing I don't get to go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls and no steps to grace the floor
For you see my mother sings in heaven now around God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this world is a better place
They're not teardrops
They're I love you drops
They were on my pillow when I woke up this morning
They were on the letter I tried all day to write
And just a little while ago I saw them
Falling on your picture as I kissed it goodnight.
You've been gone so long drops.
They're not teardrops
That say I'm lonesome
Never knew this heart could hurt the way it hurts for you
Never lived so many lifetimes in a week
Why don't you come back to me the way you said you would
And kiss these little crystals off my cheek.
You've been gone so long drops.
They're not teardrops
That say I'm lonesome
I reached out my arms and I touched you with soft words I whispered your name
I held you right on the tip of my fingers but that was as close as I came
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands but I let it slip right through my hands
Somebody took you when I wasn't looking and I should have known from the start
It's a long long way from the tip of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart to the love hidden deep in your heart
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
On the banks of the river by the railroad track
We kept chickens in a pen in the back
My daddy was a farmer but all he ever raised was us
Salvation Army give us clothes to wear
A man from the county came to cut our hair
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
That was ten dollar less than the landlord wanted for rent
The landlord's letters got nasty indeed
He wrote get out but pa couldn't read
And we was too broke to even pay heed
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
But we had something in our house money can't buy
Kept us warm in the winter cool when the sun was high
For whenever we didn't have food enough
We patched the cracks and set the table with love
The bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights.
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights.
The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
Did the God who put those stars above make those city lights
Did he make a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
Are we just supposed to run and hide behind those city lights.
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
Out of your life into a life where I'll be understood
I need a lots of tender love and your heart's made out of wood
You told me that love is one big bubble we played the game by your rules and you won
And just today I figured out the trouble I learned to crawl before I learned to run
But I'm gonna get while...
I noticed I've quit singing in the shower I rarely ever laugh and I can tell
And there's nothing left to say now but farewell
All that's left of all our love now
My lonely world is only eight by ten eight by ten eight by ten
I remember the night that you gave me that picture I ought to
I've relived it so many times I remember how I couldn't wait to get home
Put it in a frame and tell everybody that you were mine.
Because you were mine at least until someone else came along
And took you off out of my sight
It's a good thing that you did leave me your picture to hold
Because now I can cry on your shoulder every night.
My lonely world is only eight by ten.
It's awful to be jealous of an old picture frame
But I'm jealous of anything that's close to you
And that picture frame seems to be holding you pretty tight
That looks like more than I'll ever do.
I wish that I could just be the glass in that frame
And be so close to the lips that I love
I am glad that I've at least got your picture to hold
But sometimes it's just not enough
You think about your love affair and wonder what went wrong
You go to bed each night and pray you'll never see the dawn
Afraid of each tomorrow with its heartless cold unknown
And that's what it's like to be lonesome with a heart a broken love taught to cry
You search to find a tavern where the music is playing loud
You try to lose your heartaches in the laughter of the crowd
But the happy couples make you think of things that might have been
And you have to fight the teardrops till you're by yourself again
For loving you my life is so much richer
You've given so much to live for
And for loving you my faith is a little stronger
For a world that could give you to me
Couldn't be as bad as it's made out to be
And for needing you I feel a whole lot stronger
For there's a strength that comes
From knowing you need to give up yourself
And now I'm losing you and I'm a sadder lonelier man
Than I ever thought any man could be
The hunting trail of memory.
Even for all the pain that I'm feeling right now
Never once will I ever regret
Having had the chance of loving you.
I've lost count of the hours
And I've lost track of the days
And that's one thing that no one can mar
I don't know who you're with
I don't even know where you've gone
My only hope is that some day you might hear this song
And you'll know that I wrote it especially for you
This flame in my heart is like an eternal fire
For every day it burns hotter
And every day it burns higher
And I haven't been able to put out one little flicker
Not even with all of these tears
My friends think I'm crazy and maybe I am
But I'll carry this torch just as long as I can
And I want you to know
If it's true what you say in your letter
If your sweet love for me is really gone
If there's somebody else that you love better
Ain't no future in the past. broken hearts and all that jazz
So you took my photograph from your locket
And replaced it with the one you love the best
Give me back my ring and I'll go hock it
What's one little diamond more or less.
Ain't no future in the past. broken hearts and all that jazz
Ain't no future in the past. broken hearts and all that jazz
When you found somebody new I thought I never would
Forget you for I thought then I never could
Once a day all day long and once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish you weren't gone is once a day every day all day long
I'm so glad that I'm not like a man I knew one time
He lost the one he loved then slowly lost his mind
He sat around and cried his life away lucky me I'm only crying once a day
Once a day all day long...
I plowed the fields and I planted the seed
I worked my hands to the bone
But the ground laid barren till He sent the sunshine
For I can do nothing alone.
I raised the corn and I rode to the mill
With the best crop I ever had grown
But the wheel wouldn't grind till He stirred the waters
For I can do nothing alone.
I can do nothing alone
I'm weak and my Master is strong
I held the pencil but He wrote this song
For I can do nothing alone.
And now as my years lead me into the valley
I've asked Him to please come home
For I walk in search of the good life hereafter
And I can do nothing alone.
I can do nothing alone
I'm weak and my Master is strong
I held the pencil but He wrote this song
One more hour and I'll be home
Close my eyes and rest my bones
Can't be more than a mile or so
Cincinnati where the river winds
Heaven waits for me I know
I guess perhaps the memories got too strong
Grabbed me by the heart strings and pulled me home
Now there she lies at the foot of the hill
Shining like a jewel in the valley
Cincinnati where the river winds
Heaven waits for me I know
I happened to walk into a honky tonk
One night down in New Orleans
Up above the bar hung a big guitar
Like none I'd ever seen.
The neck was set with diamonds
And though the strings were old
Like Kings of sound they wound around
Six keys of solid gold.
A man stepped up beside me
His breath was strong with wine
He said you know that guitar once belonged
To a mighty close pal of mine.
He used to play it right here
If you'd care to buy me a drink.
That takes a man a fool
And then he rocked back on his stool.
He just returned from the Great War
His buddies gave him that guitar
At the time it was simple and plain
He added the gold and the diamonds
As he played his way to fame.
He was doing a show in Shreveport
The night he received a call
The greatest show at all.
I was driving him to Nashville
It was cold and misting rain
The signals flashed and the whistle screamed
I swear Mister I never saw that train.
I heard the doctor tell him
Just after he used his knife
You're lucky son it was just your arm
It could have been your life.
More than he could give
He just lost his will to live.
But this world's loss is heaven's gain
And tonight he's still a star
He plays with a band of angels
Got the alarm clock set for seven
Got the taxi called for nine
Plane takes off at eleven
And I gotta be there on time.
Told the boss I was going to my mother's
Told mama I was gonna see a friend
Out of town on a wild weekend.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little blond haired blue eyed darling
Gonna have a wild weekend.
We might go down to the sea
Somewhere off from the big wide world
Baby's gonna cook me breakfast
Baby's gonna tuck me in
With kisses on a wild weekend.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little blond haired blue eyed darling
Gonna have a wild weekend.
I guess we'll talk about the future
Mostly though we're just gonna sit by the fire
Least one time in his life
Just get away on a wild weekend
Like I'm gonna do with my wife.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little mother of my two children
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep.
I just kissed the one I love for the last time
Never have her soft lips been so sweet
She's gone away and won't be back forever
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep.
I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
I can't stand the thought of life alone without her
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep.
Just before she said goodbye she called me darling
And slowly ran her fingers down my cheek
I thought I'd die when she said she still love me
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep.
I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
I can't stand the thought of life alone without her
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep.
My mama always told me better
Than to play with a loaded gun
Never had a prisoner for a son.
The picture's still in front of my eyes
When the jury said he's guilty
The sunrise over that some old sea
An empty cell for company.
Yet there's not very much that stands between
Me and the freedom I hold dear
I kissed my darling on her tender lips
And they took me by the hand
I had a nice little ride on a ferry boat
To the rock where the prison stands.
The warden said as he locked the door
I hope you'll like it here
Just make yourself a home
I've almost forgotten what my real name is
Been a number for so long
Making little bitty rocks out of great big rocks
Gets old as the days wear on.
Just try to stay alive
The sunrise over that some old sea
An empty cell for company.
Yet there's not very much that stands between
Me and the freedom I hold dear
Papa was a simple man
Papa loved his farming land
Guess I didn't understand
Please forgive me papa.
You can't paint a picture of a man like papa
With something as empty as words
The toughness of timber
And compare it to the softness of birds.
Papa was both and yet he was neither
Just a hard working God fearing soul
He gave what he had to the ones that he loved
And I guess he loved me best of all.
For I was the oldest and we were the closest
We worked that old farm side by side
I guess that's the reason it hit me the hardest
The morning that my papa died.
All I could think of was how hard he'd worked
And what little comfort he'd found
I guess that's the reason I hitched up the mule
And drove the old buggy to town.
I picked out a lot in the big cemetery
In the shade of a tall maple tree
Figured it's the least I could do for my papa
After all the things that he's done for me.
We gave him a funeral fit for a king
And then we laid him to rest in the sod
Somehow I thought that in that big pretty place
He just might feel closer to God.
The women were crying as they passed by papa
The men stopped and all shook my hand
Most of the mourners had gone when I looked up
And noticed this white haired old man.
He was dressed kinda shabby and he walked with a cane
His voice was shaky and low
He used to work for us a long time ago.
They told me this morning that the big boss had died
And I thought that I should come around
They told me that you done brought him to town.
I remember your papa used to say that when he died
He didn't have but one request
He wanted to be buried out dare on that farm
Found me an old paper sack
I scooped up some dirt from up near the farmhouse
And thought that I'd just bring it back.
I hope you don't mind if I just sorta scatter these
Few little pieces of clay
It ain't gonna mess up your pretty green grass
He just might sleep better this way.
The greatest gift that I posses
With more than my share of happiness.
To me this old world is a wonderful place
And I'm just about the luckiest human in the whole human race
I've got no silver and I've got no gold
Just a whole lot of happiness in my soul.
The greatest gift that I posses
With more than my share of happiness.
Happiness to me is an ocean tide
Or a sunset fading on a mountain side
Or maybe a big old heaven full of stars up above
When I'm in the arms of the one I love.
Happiness is a field of grain
Lifting its face to the falling rain
I can see it in the sunshine
The greatest gift that I posses
With more than my share of happiness.
A wise old man told me one time
That happiness is nothing but a frame of mind
I hope when you go to measuring my success
The greatest gift that I posses
With more than my share of happiness.
The greatest gift that I posses
I came home last night to a dark and lonely cottage
I took the wreath off the door and somehow I stumbled inside
I just can't I just can't I said live without her
Give me one reason to live now that my darling has died.
And then five little fingers
Too young to understand.
And there was a softness in my little girl's touch
That seemed to say daddy I need you so
And in five little seconds her five little fingers
Told me all that I wanted to know.
I could tell her little eyes were full of questions
I tried to answer but all I could do was hold her tight
Forgive me forgive me I said for crying
But darling your daddy has got such a load on his shoulders tonight.
And then five little fingers
Touched me on the cheek
And gently brushed away a tear.
And I knew that in her own little way
My baby was saying daddy I love you so
It only took five little seconds for her five little fingers
To tell me all that I needed to know.
Got the alarm clock set for seven
Got the taxi called for nine
Plane takes off at eleven
And I gotta be there on time.
Told the boss I was going to my mother's
Told mama I was gonna see a friend
Out of town on a wild weekend.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little blond haired blue eyed darling
Gonna have a wild weekend.
We might go down to the sea
Somewhere off from the big wide world
Baby's gonna cook me breakfast
Baby's gonna tuck me in
With kisses on a wild weekend.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little blond haired blue eyed darling
Gonna have a wild weekend.
I guess we'll talk about the future
Mostly though we're just gonna sit by the fire
Least one time in his life
Just get away on a wild weekend
Like I'm gonna do with my wife.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little mother of my two children
With my hair down in my eyes
And I stumble to the breakfast table
And she reaches out and takes my hand
That warm my heart and see my morning sun.
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
Disneyland and Mother Goose is no nursery rhyme
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime.
I think about her face aglow
And I'll ask her if she'd get away
And come downtown and meet me.
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat
And she hurries down to meet me
And smiles when she first sees me
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't snow in Minneapolis
When the winter comes
There's no such thing as make believe
Puppy dogs and autumn leaves
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis
I think about her face aglow
Won't it ever be morning
Won't the dawn ever break
In the shape that I'm in
I love you and miss you so much
It's barely twelve o'clock
But I've already spent a lifetime
Was any time but nighttime.
And I just heard it thunder
Your picture on the wall just laughed at me
Won't it ever be morning
Won't the dawn ever break
In the shape that I'm in
I love you and miss you so much
I love you and miss you so much
A lesson too late for a learning
In the wink of an eye my soul was turning
Are you going away with no words of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
You know that was the last thing on my mind.
Underneath my feet a subway rumbling
Are you going away with no words of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
You know that was the last thing on my mind.
You've got reasons of plenty for going
The weeds have been steadily growing
Are you going away with no words of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
You know that was the last thing on my mind.
Remember the story I read to you when I tucked you in last night
About the pretty princess who loved the party life
Well that's the way that mommy is but she'll be home after while
So dry your tears my little ones and give your daddy a smile
Mommy's away at the castle now where party people go
She's likely dancing with the king her pretty eyes aglow
But she'll be home on Sunday dears to go to church with us
Lost in long and warm ago
A smile of sadness curved my lips my thoughts rushed back in time
To when you loved me long and warm ago
The breeze that cooled our faces is now an icy wind
It chills me to the bone and makes me know
That nothing is forever and everything must end
And be just a part of long and warm ago
We tasted of the rain we trusted in the sun
We talked of holding hands when we grew old
But you left and now tomorrow like yesterday is gone lost in long and warm ago
You've cried the last tear you're gonna cry
You've kissed your last lips that cheat and lie
Your heartache's over it's all gone
I'll make you happy from now on
And no one's gonna hurt you anymore.
But give me a while and I'll make you smile
For the times he's made you sad
You've cried the last tear you're gonna cry
You've kissed your last lips that cheat and lie.
Cling to me and I'll kiss away all of your tears.
Here in my arms you'll be safe from harm
Now and for all the coming years
Your heartache's over it's all gone
I'll make you happy from now on.
No one's gonna hurt you anymore.
Wish that I was on old Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bills.
Once I had a girl on Rocky Top
Part bear the other part cat
Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop
I still dream about that.
Home sweet home to me
Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top
Reckon they never will
Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top
Ground's too rocky by far
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar
Home sweet home to me
I've had years of cramped up city life
Trapped like a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a pity life
Can't be simple again.
Home sweet home to me
The birthday party was over toys were scattered here and there
Seven candles laid by the last piece of cake in front of an empty chair
A mother said son I know you're disappointed but please
So you go on to sleep now she kissed him and turned out the light
Moments later a window opened and the young boy slipped out
He was on his way to the depot the express wasn't due till ten
The whirl of the wheels and the clang of the steel
Jarred the country side
The southbound freight was running late desperate to make up time
When a giant of a man with a sack in his hand
Leaped off like a mountain lion
He hit and rolled like an old pro and he got up off the ground
He brushed the snow from off his grimy clothes and said
Hey kid what's the name of this town
The man said well what do ya know
Ha I used to live in this little one horse town
I guess about six or maybe it was seven years ago
I told my wife when I left here that I'd be coming back in style
Ha oh well anyway it looks like I'm back I guess
I just might as well visit awhile
So if you'll be so kind as to point the way to the Joneses
Why I'll go now and leave you be
The young boy said sir the only Joneses that live around here
Is my mama and my daddy and me
Course dad he's been gone a long time now
Course now he don't want to be ye understand
It's just that daddy's got lots of important things to do
You see he's a big railroad man
He sends me birthday presents and mama reads me what he writes
In his last letter daddy promised that he was gonna
Try and make it home tonight
The old man scratched the side of his head and he said
Oh well I guess that's natural mistake
Now if you'll just point the way to the depot
Why I'll be checking on the next fast freight
Tell you what you run on home now and you tell your mom
To go ahead and fix up your daddy's room
It's knowing that your door is always open and your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be planted on their columns now that binds me
Or something that somebody said because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
For hours you're just gentle on my mind
And the junk yards and the highways come between us
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And a summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walking on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
My beard a roughen coal pile and a dirty hat that pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands around a tin can I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
Close my eyes with a smile
Let me rest and dream awhile.
Two young lovers holding hands
I used to dream way back when.
Before the eternal sadness set in
Let me rest and dream awhile.
Let me dream of the sunlight shining in her hair
Of the days with laughter in the air
Take me back to my world of happiness again
Before the eternal sadness set in.
Sleep sweet and deep let me rest and dream awhile
If it's all the same to you if you don't love me like before
I don't think I'll hang around and let you hurt me anymore
If it's all the same to you if your love has really gone
Pardon me while I walk out pick up my heart and move along
I'll bet you somewhere I'll find someone I can thrill with my kiss
If it's all the same to you...
Yes it's true honey I sadly think it is
Think of your fellow man lend him a helping hand put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place and the world will be a better place
For you for you and me and me you just wait you just wait and see and see
Another day goes by and still the children cry put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know we won't let hatred grow put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place...
Take a good look around and if you're looking down put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide on just who'll be your guide put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place...
Put a little love in your heart each and every day
Put a little love in your heart everybody
Who always kept her distance
The wall of solid resistance.
Who would have thought it would lead to this
Love has touched the untouchables
What am I gonna tell him
How will I explain to her
Falling for you this way.
Married and both untouchables
And that's what makes things worse
For love has touched the untouchables
Right where it hurts.
What am I gonna tell him
How will I explain to her
Falling for you this way.
Married and both untouchables
And that's what makes things worse
For love has touched the untouchables
Are built around you.
I'd be like Miami without any sun
Without you I'm nothing
Without you I'm nothing
Without you I'm nothing
Without you I'm nothing
And you don't come back
Without a railroad track.
With a no place to run
Without you I'm nothing
Without you I'm nothing
You emptied all my pockets
You took away my gold
You stripped me of my innocence
And left me in the cold.
You robbed me of my patience
And you messed up my mind
But we're gonna stick together babe
You set my very soul on fire
And burned it to the ground
You took my lovely little world
And turned it upside down.
You robbed me of my patience
And you messed up my mind
But we're gonna stick together babe
But we're gonna stick together babe
Who is the biggest fool of the two you for loving me or me for loving you
We were both just out on the town both of us just killing time
When almost before I knew it your lips found their way up to mine
And now here we are doing things we both know we shouldn't do
And darling I wonder just which one of us is the biggest fool of the two
Who is the biggest fool of the two you for loving me or me for loving you
Tomorrow we know we've got to forget this somehow
But in your arms tomorrow seems almost forever from now
But baby you've got another the same as I do
And it all just makes me stop and wonder
Which one of us is the biggest fool of the two
Who is the biggest fool of the two you for loving me or me for loving you
I come home every night and she meets me with a great big kiss
And she says I love you and how was your day
And vows her love for me won't ever fade away.
I told her once I was born with a restless streak in me
But she laughed it off and said honey you're just a man
Go where you have to go do what you have to do
I love you and I'll wait for you and I'll understand.
I called her up last night from down in Mexico
She said baby it's cold tonight and I'm alone
I'm not gonna hold anybody I'm not gonna kiss anybody
I'm saving me for you till you get home.
Everybody tells me that I'm not the same
I don't need nobody to tell my troubles to
I don't need nobody to tell my troubles to
I know you're married
But I love you still.
I knew you weren't free
But I knew I'd love you
And though I knew you
Would never leave your side.
I know you're married
But I love you still.
There's room for only you
I know you're married
But I love you still.
I know you're married
Now do you want my love or are we through
I've got my heart in my hand but there's so much that I don't understand
And baby I don't know what I've done wrong
You know I worship the ground you walked on
Let's take time out to get acquainted again
We're man and wife we might as well be friends.
You don't kiss me like you used to kiss me
Sometimes I take that there must be somebody new
And when I come home at night
You act like you didn't even miss me
Lately honey I've even had my doubts about you.
We used to face the world and life together
We used to talk of our ambitions and our dreams
We have time for everything except each other it seems.
Let's take time out to get acquainted again
We're man and wife we might as well be friends.
Let's go away and spend some time together
And see if that old spark of love's still burning bright
I want us to be close you know like we used to be
And not just two ships that pass each other in the night.
Let's take time out to get acquainted again
Love is a sometimes thing your love is a sometimes thing
It comes and goes like winter and spring yes your love is a sometimes thing
You told me you would always care in time of need you'd always be there
But lately I've seen so little of you makes me wonder what you been up to
Love is a sometimes thing...
I said I'd never say it again
I guess I shouldn't say anything at all
Since you're supposed to belong to him
But I just can't let you go
So that is why I'm gonna say it one more time.
Each lonely day's a little bit longer
And the last time I held you
Seems like a hundred years ago
Back to his arms and never know
The joy of love that used to taste like
I'm just gonna take my bags now I'm gonna walk
But if you ever want somebody to just love you
And some day you just may you just give me a call
You know where I am and here's what I'll say.
Honey come back I just can't stand it
Each lonely day's a little bit longer
And the last time I held you
Seems like a hundred years ago
Back to his arms and never know
The joy of love that used to taste like
I can see the dark clouds over head
Now I see raindrops falling from the sky
Seems every living thing is dead now
Ever since the day you said goodbye.
I can hear the winter winds a blowing
They chill my body to the bone
I can feel my life's slowly going
By changing your mind
Drive away the clouds
So the sun can shine.
You can change it all by saying
You're coming back and staying
You can change my world
By changing your mind.
Mine is a world of desolation
Everything I cared about is gone
Only you can change the situation
And all you got to do is come back home.
By changing your mind
Drive away the clouds
So the sun can shine.
You're coming back and staying
You can change my world
You told me late last night you wished I'd leave you
Your love for me is gone and we both know
I'll do anything I can to make you happy but I don't have anyplace to go
To stay in town would be like dying slow
The fault is mine for loving you so deeply no man should ever love one woman so
For there you stand telling me to leave you and I don't have anyplace to go
Why you'd be so surprised
You'd stare up at the heavens
With those big blue eyes.
And the wind would carry
All of your light up to the skies
Then the land would be dry
And your boat wouldn't sail
And your kite wouldn't fly.
And the grass would see
All of your troubles and she'd tell the wind
Why you'd probably cry
And the ground would be weathered
By the tears from your eyes.
And then like your love for me
The grass would grow so high
I wish you only knew all the days I've made it through
Because of you and your sweet love
I wish that I could count the times peace and comfort filled my mind
Because of you and your sweet love
You're what keeps me going the sun that lights my sky
The rose that blooms in winter the rain that cools July
Never try to tell me it wasn't God above that sent me you and your sweet love
Almost every night it seems you come walking through my dreams
Precious you and your sweet love
And tonight though we're apart there's a fullness in my heart
Thanks to you and your sweet love
You're the rock I cling to the star I wish upon
The water in my desert the anchor in my storm
Never try to tell me it wasn't God above that sent me you and your sweet love
What is my reason for going on living when I'm not really living at all
I come home in the evening there's no laughter there to fill the air
A cool lonely room to meet me nobody here to greed me where has our love gone
And then my thoughts begin to stray back to a happy yesterday
When love was here beside me your love was here to guide me where did I go wrong
What is my reason for going on living when I'm not really living at all
I reach down for the paper and I see a toy our little boy
I guess I never took the time to fix a hurt or make a rhyme
Or carry him on my shoulder will he forgive me when he's older
Or will he remember my name
What is my reason for going on living when I'm not really living at all
I found a puppy down the street with big sad eyes and muddy feet
There's nobody here to claim him no wonder round here to name him
Or take him for a walk
I keep him here for company and he looks up so sad at me
Each time he sees me crying he knows inside I'm dying if only he could talk
What is my reason for going on living when I'm not really living at all
Last night I was preparing to go to a party
And on the rack with my suits
I found the shirt that I'd worn
When I held her in my arms
For the very last time
The shirt that I vowed I'd never wear again.
As I took it from the rack
The faint perfume of sweet love filled the night
I could see her face again
She kissed my lips as then
And I almost felt my arms around her tight.
A shirt that even the Gods must envy
For its arms once encircled
The dream that only heavens could bring.
Against this shirt once beat
The most wonderful heart in the whole wide world
And forever each thread shall remind me of her
For I found a strand of her soft golden hair
I slowly took it down like a star from an angel's crown
I closed my eyes and softly said a prayer.
Then I walked to the window sill
My eyes began to fill
I thought I heard the soft wind call her name
And the shirt across my arm
Grew strangely soft and warm
As if I'd reached and held it to a flame.
Of my own aching heart
Lost in the dreams of what might have been
And the shirt seemed as sorrowful as I
I can't settle down and marry you we both know that
But I dedicate my life to you each minute that I live
And if you'll only try and take me like I am
I'll give you what there is of me to give
I can't live with you but I'll live for you
Every minute every hour every day
I can't live with you but I'll live for you
And I'll try to make you happy in my own way
I'll ache for you each morning when the sun comes up
I'll dream of you at midnight when I lay me down to sleep
I'll be true to you with every single breath I take
All that's mine but me is yours to keep
You followed me to Texas
You followed me to Utah
We didn't find it there so we moved on
Things look good in Birmingham
We didn't find it there so we moved on.
I know you're tired of following
My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things
You had my child in Memphis
I heard of work in Nashville
We didn't find it there so we moved on
To a small farm in Nebraska
To a gold mine in Alaska
We didn't find it there so we moved on.
And now we've left Alaska
Because there was no gold mine
But this time only two of us move on
And now all we have is each other
And a little memory to cling to
And still you won't let me go all alone.
I know you're tired of following
My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things
For they're only fleeting things
People laugh and love and cry
And I'm still missing you
The paper boy still comes around
Just like he used to do
But he's a little taller now
And I'm still missing you.
There's talk about an early snow
And I'm still missing you
And I'm still missing you
But with me they only blow
Across the surface of my heart
And they can't cool this memory
Of you that burns so deep inside me.
Dick and Jane came by today
Their baby's almost due
People laugh and love and cry
And I'm still missing you.
Always remember I love you
Always remember your whole life through
I'd give anything in this world if I could be with you right now
And hold you real tight in my arms
But since I can't I thought maybe if you knew
How much I missed you.
It might help you feel peaceful and warm
Always remember I love you I love you you just you
Always remember your whole life through I love you just you
And I ever thought I won't be there to lay down beside you tonight.
It's not because I don't care
Every dream and every prayer
The boss needs me to come to work in the morning he told me so
My landlord needs me to pay my rent or out I go
The parakeet needs me to teach him a song
The puppy dog needs me to bring him a bone
I need love your kind of love tender warm and sweet
I need your lips to kiss me and tell me I'm your man
Talk to me in the language of love that's all I understand
My next door neighbor needs me to help him paint his fence
The sailboat needs me to find some wind sail it up and down the water again
And you need me just to be your friend
She didn't look so pretty as some other I have known
And she wasn't good at conversation when we were alone.
But she had a way of making me believe that I belong
And it felt like coming home when I found her.
She seemed to be so proud of me just walking holding hands
And she didn't think that money was the measure of a man.
And we seemed to fit together when I held her in my arms
And it left me feeling warm when I loved her.
She brightened up the day like the early morning sun
And she made what I was doing seem worthwhile
It's the closest thing to living that I guess I've ever done
And it made me want to smile when I loved her.
Some of us were born to cast our fortunes to the wind
And I guess I'm bound to travel down a road that never ends
But I know I'll never look upon the likes of her again
And I'll never understand why I lost her.
She brightened up the day like the early morning sun
And she made what I was doing seem worthwhile
It's the closest thing to living that I guess I've ever done
And it made me want to smile when I loved her.
I see the town where we were born I see the place we were raised
I see all the things you wanted that I never gave
I see sadness I see sorrow I see pain on your face
But I just can't see a stranger in my place
I can see now where we quarreled I can see now I was wrong
I can see where you might weaken and I wasn't strong
But I just can't see a stranger in my place
No one seems to know you quite like I do no one knows the things that make you cry
And looking back it seems I never showed you and now I lay alone and wonder why
I can see now where you might grow tired of dreams that don't come true
I can see where I have fallen short of the things I promised you
I can see now through my tear filled eyes no love on your face
To find that you had not yet made it home
And I sat up too many midnights crying
Till now the time for tears has come and gone.
One too many mornings
One too many midnights without you
Left me no choice but to say goodbye to you.
And now you found I'm gonna leave you
You think it's time to say how much you care
You say you just can't live without my loving
Love you never seemed to need when it was there.
One too many mornings
One too many midnights without you
Left me no choice but to say goodbye to you.
One too many mornings
One too many midnights without you
Time has passed and things have changed you've gone your way I've gone mine
On the surface it's all over but beneath the surface you're still on my mind
Your lips are still the lips I'm dreaming of and you're still the only one I'll ever love
All my thoughts of you are good ones happy hours that just flew by
You were always someone special and you'll be my someone special till I die
I'm a little bit red in the eyes
A little bit hurt in the heart
A little bit weary in the soul
You mean I'm worth the dime it took
To call me on the phone
Since when are you concerned
About the way things are at home.
I'm doing fine without you
I don't care what you're doing
And I careless where you're at.
I'm a little bit red in the eyes
A little bit hurt in the heart
A little bit weary in the soul
There's groceries on the shelf
You're not here to take care of me
So I found somebody else.
But I date the girl who does
She comes over here and loves me
I'm a little bit red in the eyes
A little bit hurt in the heart
A little bit weary in the soul
I heard the front door closing softly
As I wakened from my sleep
With the last touch of her lips Lord
Like a whisper on my cheek.
And I cursed the sun for rising
But come sundown she'll be gone.
See the lipstick on the pillow
That I placed beneath her head
And the soft sheets still feel warm Lord
Where she lay upon my bed.
And it hurts to know it's over
Day after day and for hour upon precious hour
I've held you and marveled at love that stayed fresh as a flower
From daylights to nightfall through sunlight and rainfall
Our spark hasn't once lost its glow
My arms have entwined you but never confined you
I'd die if you left but I want you to feel free to go
Feel free to go if my love ever feels like a chain around your heart
Stay cause you want me not cause you feel like you're tied
I love you I need you a love that so few people know
I want you to stay but I want you to feel free to go
If we should ever come to the forks in the road you go your way
And never look back in regret that you hurt me in some way
For right now if the sun stopped and all of the fond stop
My cup would still overflow
For you've been a treasure beyond any measure
I'd die if you left but I want you to feel free to go
Take the ribbon from your hair shake it loose and let it fall
Laying soft against my skin like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side till the early morning light
All I'm taking is your time help me make it through the night
I don't care who's right or wrong I won't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow Lord tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone and tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone help me make it through the night
They say I sing my songs with lots of blue eyed soul
What they mean is Lord I sing it sad
But feeling like I feel I can't sing no other way
She left me Lord and oh I hurt so bad
And lonesome is the mother of soul and lonesome gave birth to my blues
I'm the orphan child of emptiness the son of heartache untold
And lonesome is the mother of soul
I thought that hurts like this were saved for those who are dying
Lord I must be dying and not know
The soulful sound you hear from me is only my heart crying
I'm lonesome and I miss my baby so
And lonesome is the mother of soul...
Someone you've loved so much before
We ran out of anything to call it so we called it quits.
The longer you live with someone you can't live with
We called it magic then we called it tragic
Finally we called it quits.
It's always been harder to fall out of love than fall in
But I doubt if I'll ever forget where I've been
We couldn't call it happy though it was for a while
The longer you live with someone you can't live with
We called it lovely then we called it lonely
Finally we called it quits.
We called it magic then we called it tragic
You've cried the last tear you're gonna cry
You've kissed your last lips that cheat and lie
Your heartache's over it's all gone
I'll make you happy from now on
And no one's gonna hurt you anymore.
But give me a while and I'll make you smile
For the times he's made you sad
You've cried the last tear you're gonna cry
You've kissed your last lips that cheat and lie.
Cling to me and I'll kiss away all of your tears.
Here in my arms you'll be safe from harm
Now and for all the coming years
Your heartache's over it's all gone
I'll make you happy from now on.
No one's gonna hurt you anymore.
You don't understand the pattern of my life
Because my life has got no pattern
You don't see and you can't feel the wind
That's blowing at my back and saying move boy
You think this burning fever in my heart is just a folly
I've tried my best to plant my feet and stay with you
But all I feel is roots grow
And what man wants a woman who won't satisfy his heart
I sleep all day and run all night
And you tell me that that ain't right
That ain't what the husbands of your friends do
You try to make me think my nonconforming life
Has colored me some evil shade
You delight and filling up my mind
Well I'm tired of feeling guilty and I'm tired of having nothing
I've tried my best to plant my feet and stay with you
But all I feel is roots grow
And what man wants a woman who won't satisfy his heart
I sleep all day and run all night
And you tell me that that ain't right
That ain't what the husbands of your friends do
Always remember I love you
Always remember your whole life through
I'd give anything in this world if I could be with you right now
And hold you real tight in my arms
But since I can't I thought maybe if you knew
How much I missed you.
It might help you feel peaceful and warm
Always remember I love you I love you you just you
Always remember your whole life through I love you just you
And I ever thought I won't be there to lay down beside you tonight.
It's not because I don't care
Every dream and every prayer
Got the alarm clock set for seven
Got the taxi called for nine
Plane takes off at eleven
And I gotta be there on time.
Told the boss I was going to my mother's
Told mama I was gonna see a friend
Out of town on a wild weekend.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little blond haired blue eyed darling
Gonna have a wild weekend.
We might go down to the sea
Somewhere off from the big wide world
Baby's gonna cook me breakfast
Baby's gonna tuck me in
With kisses on a wild weekend.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little blond haired blue eyed darling
Gonna have a wild weekend.
I guess we'll talk about the future
Mostly though we're just gonna sit by the fire
Least one time in his life
Just get away on a wild weekend
Like I'm gonna do with my wife.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little mother of my two children
Where have all our heroes gone
What's come over our great land
America is still my home sweet home
I saw a group of boys the other day
Standing in the corner of a playground
And I overheard one of the boys
Said man is he ever cool
And he pointed to the man
Who's picture was on the magazine cover
And everybody kinda said under their breath
And I got sick to my stomach
Because I'd seen the cover
And the man that they were talking about
Had instigated a riot in one of our major cities last summer
And the magazine was writing
About how the police were unkind to him
The judges were not fair with him
And how he talked back and slung
His long hair about and cussed
And did his things and they made him into a regular hero.
And inside this magazine was the story of a baseball player
Who got involved with the gamblers
Of the football player who said that football was not the end
And a story of a folk singer who proudly claims
These young boys read with open eyes and open minds
And I thought to myself my God
Are these the people that these young boys look up to
And our heroes did their thing too
Who returned like he said he would
Who chased the bad guys right off the screen
Like Lindberg who flew the ocean
And Jesse Owens who showed Hitler
And John Wayne and Gerry Cooper
After all didn't they really win the war
And General Ike bless your soul
We've killed some of our recent heroes
And even as great as their space feats are
How many of the astronauts can you name huh how many
My heroes were people like Joe DiMaggio
Who proved that nice guys can finish first
And Winston Churchill who's two fingers
Raised together meant victory.
But it doesn't need any one thing anymore
Than it needs some real heroes.
Men who know what it means
Men who wanna sign autograph books
And not deal under the table
Men who are willing to play the game
With the people who made them heroes
Men who don't mind putting on a white hat
And saying thank you and please
I wish I knew more men that I'd be proud of
For my son to look up to and say
Out of your life into a life where I'll be understood
I need a lots of tender love and your heart's made out of wood
You told me that love is one big bubble we played the game by your rules and you won
And just today I figured out the trouble I learned to crawl before I learned to run
But I'm gonna get while...
I noticed I've quit singing in the shower I rarely ever laugh and I can tell
And there's nothing left to say now but farewell
Now the morning sun streaks across my room
And I'm wakened up from another dream of you
All I've left behind is a chain of broken dreams.
How I wish this love was all we'd need to live
And it seems so wrong deep inside my heart
That the dollar sign should be keeping us apart.
If only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life had not yet crossed our minds
For the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you.
But you know we can't live on dreams alone
Got to pay the rent got to leave you all alone
But you know I made my choice many years ago
Now this traveling life is the only life I know.
Love is a sometimes thing your love is a sometimes thing
It comes and goes like winter and spring yes your love is a sometimes thing
You told me you would always care in time of need you'd always be there
But lately I've seen so little of you makes me wonder what you been up to
Love is a sometimes thing...
Maybe I don't love you quite as much as I believe I love you baby
Maybe I don't need you quite as much as I profess to need you baby
And who's to say anyway that love is not a game we play
As long as I feel warm inside wanted filled and satisfied
Maybe I just gotta have somebody and you're close and you're somebody
But don't leave me you've put me in a happy state of mind
And who's to say anyway...
Where have all our heroes gone
What's come over our great land
America is still my home sweet home
I saw a group of boys the other day

I wish I knew more men that I'd be proud of
For my son to look up to and say
Don't look so sad I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that were burning
Lay your head upon my pillow hold your warm tender body close to mine
And make believe you love me just one more time for the good times
I'll get along you'll find another and I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
Lay your head upon my pillow hold your warm tender body close to mine
I loved you more in just a few hours than most people love in all of their years
And now though you're gone I still have you with me
The sweetest reflections fill the loneliest tears
Oh what a mark you left on my body destroyed my heart and crippled my mind
And if I should live until I'm one hundred
I'll never forget you there's not enough time
And I'll spend my life...
Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans.
We sang up ever song that driver knew.
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee.
From the coal mines of Kentucky
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold.
I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For just one yesterday
Holding Bobby's body close to mine.
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee.
I remember how once upon a time
Before I could even phone you I had to borrow a dime
I had nothing to give you and still you said you'd be mine
Lord these were the good years
A big night on the town for us used to be
Just two glasses of wine on our first anniversary
Oh I know you could have more but you stuck by me those were the sweet years
But I wasn't happy though you were complained
I wanted to give you more than just my name
I wanted to buy you not wine but champagne and then came the hard years
Just to buy you all the things that you never even asked me for
And I never noticed but you changed more and more those were the sad years
And even when I had it all I didn't want to stop
Those were the selfish years
And then I stopped one minute of my busy day
I felt like something was missing and what I couldn't say
And when I realized that it was love that had died away and then came the bad years
Before you take another step there's something you should know
About the years ahead and how they'll be
You'll be living in a world where roses hardly ever grow
Cause all I have to offer you is me
There'll be no mansions waiting on the hill with crystal chandeliers
And there'll be no fancy clothes for you to wear
Everything I have is standing here in front of you to see all I have to offer you is me
Sweetheart I'll give you all my love in every way I can
But make sure that's what you want while you're still free
The only gold I have for you is in this wedding band all I have to offer you is me
There'll be no mansions...
You know I don't think much about her anymore
Seldom if ever does she cross my mind
Like the poison red berries to die on the vine.
Had some coffee and talked with some old friends of mine
Laughing at all the good times they remember
And then I remembered the time.
I can still see those bright lights back in Dallas
As yesterday moves like a dream through my mind
I really didn't suppose that I'd never forget her
And you know it took such a long time.
But I don't think much about her no more
Seldom if ever does she cross my mind
Yesterday's gone it's better forgotten
So kiss my lips goodnight and head on home
It can't go anywhere but wrong
And all the money in the world
Couldn't buy back these precious memories
In fact I'm counting on the warmth of your love
To live here in my heart forever like a beautiful song
But I'm afraid if we didn't say goodbye tonight
And part as friends we may never get the chance to
We've pushed our luck to make it as long as it has
You know that as well as I do.
Nobody anywhere even has
But if we're not careful
The one thing that's looked so beautiful to us
Is gonna look so ugly in the eyes of the world
I want you to get out of the car
Come here and stand with me by the side of the road
Look out there in the distance for a minute
But it's a mean old world out there baby.
And they don't understand people like me and you
Who just want to love and be left alone
I don't know where this old highway goes
But I'm gonna turn around right now.
So kiss my lips goodnight and head on home
We used to talk together remember
And we used to do things crazy things I guess
When we knew we couldn't buy anything
And sometimes when it rained you'd sit beside me
And we'd race raindrops down the window pane
You'd bring me coffee
And we'd work crossword puzzles together
We don't do anything together now.
And late at night remember we used to sit outside
Big dreams and plans and
You used to look at me and you'd say
You had faith in me and you always
Gave me the strength that I needed.
It was a stupid reason for an argument
But this time you just ran out.
And when the phone rang and they told me
While a walking down a street in Denver
I passed by a little dress shop
A sign on the door read Melinda's
And I asked myself if I should stop.
For I knew a girl named Melinda
When I lived here years ago
And I wondered if by chance it could be
The Melinda I used to know.
So I peeked in through the window
I saw my darling Melinda
And a tear came to my eyes.
For she looked lovely as always
As I watched her standing there
Her face was like an angel's
With a halo of golden hair.
Then I slowly remembered
How she suffered the shame
Of being left with a baby
And me never changing her name.
So ashamed I hung down my head
But the young girl said sir
I'm sorry but you see my mother is dead.
You know friends are never earned
They are a gift from the loving God
They're precious beyond human evaluation
You dare not take them for granted
Or they'll drift away like smoke
And the warmth of there caring
Will vanish into the chill of the endless night.
Most of my friends are unknowns
They probably won't even rate an obituary
Unless they live and die in a small town
But some of my friends are big people
Their names are household words
And yet they are no more precious
In God's eyes or in mine.
Then those wonderful nobodies
Who live and die in obscurity
He's someone who warns you with a nod
Or with an unspoken word in hard times
When you are hurting beyond words
She's someone who holds you to her breast
And sighs softly into your hair.
When no other medicine
Could possibly stop the pain
A friend is someone who clinks
A glass against yours
At three in the morning when you're lost
And with a few words of encouragement
And concern makes you realize
Your not really lost at all.
Friends come in both sexes
In all shapes and sizes
The most important thing
They have in common is
Their ability to share with you
Your most sky splitting joys
I think of all the things I have in this world
You like your new dress for a while
Then you say it went out of style
And you liked your new car for a mouth or so
The next day you dig baseball games
The way that you keep changing things
The only thing I know to say
If love can leave me feeling this way
I don't want it I don't need it never again
If this is what love's all about
I'm so much better off without it
If love's a thing we only borrow
Here today and gone tomorrow
If love can do this to someone
If this is the thanks for all I've done
If you came back again
Then it all depends on how I feel
If I can just get over you I think too much of me
Nobody knows what I go through
And still you're not happy here with me
And still you want me to set you free.
We've been through thick and thin together
Braved the fair and stormy weather
We've had all the hard times you and I
And now that I'm a big success
You called today and you confessed
And told me things that make me want to die.
You told me there's another man
Who can give more than I can
And I've given everything that cash will buy
You can buy me a peaceful night
With loving arms around me tight
And you're too busy to notice the hurt in my eyes.
And still you're not happy here with me
We walked the warm streets of Florida
With sand in our pockets lots of times
Walked the cold streets of New York
With two guitars and a tin cup just for dimes.
We spent one winter in Winnipeg
A summer in the Mississippi sun
Had some trouble once in Fargo
We made the papers once in Phoenix
When we stopped and tried to break up a fight
We hit keno in Reno and lost it all
In Vegas the very next night.
We hopped a train in Chicago
And skinny dipped in San Francisco bay
We checked it all in the big hotels
Then used the fire escape to get away.
And we wouldn't trade it all for the world and all of its gold
Mother Luck's been good to us and we will praise her in our songs
For the good times and the good love she has given.
We flew into Kansas City
Early April 24th without a plane
We got stranded in a snow storm
With some folks from Salt Lake City on a train.
We spent a week one night in LA
Looking for a doctor's daughter on the strip
Then we wound up in Nashville
And we wouldn't trade it all for the world and all of its gold
Mother Luck's been good to us and we will praise her in our songs
For the good times and the good love she has given.
And we wouldn't trade it all for the world and all of its gold
Mother Luck's been good to us and we will praise her in our songs
Is simply knowing you're mine
Wherever I go and whatever I do
Always knowing you're mine.
And when I close my eyes at night slumber comes easy
There's nothing to trouble my mind
The happiest way to greet each tomorrow is waking
And knowing you're mine.
I'm sure that's what happened this time
I thank the Lord for the peace and contentment
Of always knowing you're mine.
So hold to my hand and let's walk on together
Wherever the long road may wind
I'll feel secure and serene and so lucky
Always knowing you're mine.
You've just gotta be one of
The most beautiful people in the whole wide world
It's true and I love you.
You're so easy to make conversation with
And nobody else could please me that way
You've just gotta be one of
The most beautiful people in the whole wide world
It's true and I love you.
Every day of the week for me.
People turn around they know
We're the luckiest people today in this old town
It's no wonder that they kinda wonder
If we're not the happiest could around.
You've just gotta be one of
The most beautiful people in the whole wide world
It's true and I love you.
You've just gotta be one of
The most beautiful people in the whole wide world
It's true and I love you
More and more I'm forgetting the past more and more I'm living at last
I wish you knew how hard I'd tried to keep you by my side
And I wish you knew how many tears I cried the day we said goodbye
I tried everything in my power to keep you by my side
And the worst day of my life was the day that we said goodbye
I know you've gotta leave me for a few short days
I've heard about those city girls
I know you'll meet some pretty girls
Please wait till ya get back home
I'll phone you every evening if you'll stay at home
This town is full of guys who can put big stars in your eyes
Please wait till I get back home
Don't let it happen without me
Don't let it happen without me.
Don't let it happen without me.
Don't let it happen without me.
I just lost my darling who kissed me goodbye
And I don't care now if I live or die.
I wish I could take you and run off somewhere
But I can't forget him and how much I cared
I was looking back to see if you were looking back to see
If I was looking back to see if you were looking back at me
You were cute as you could be standing looking back at me
And it was plain to see that I'd enjoy your company
I met a cute little girl all dressed up so neat
I was looking back to see...
Now listen baby it don't matter to me
Even in your model T you're as cute as you can be
If you'll take me for a ride I will set close by your side
And I will guarantee that we'll have fun oh man alive
I was looking back to see...
Someday we'll be together
Someday we'll be together
But just as sure my baby
As there are stars above.
Someday we'll be together
You possess my very soul
Someday we'll be together
A long time ago I made a big mistake
Ever since that day all I wanna do
I long for you every night
And hold you so tight.
Someday we'll be together
Someday we'll be together
Someday we'll be together
This song's for all the lonely women in the world
This song's for all the lonely women in the world
To me there's nothing sadder than to see a lonely one
Neglected by the one she loves so much
Chances are she works all day and then goes home to night
Yet I've known girls with husbands in the house and still they're lonely
They've lost him to the TV and the beer
I guess somehow my heart goes out to all the lonely women
In love with all the men who just don't care
This song's for all the lonely women in the world
This song's for all the lonely women in the world
The alarm clock woke my sleeping but I lay there for a minute
With a million cobwebs clinging to my brain
I stopped the bell from ringing in the times it takes a heartbeat
Then I settled back and closed my eyes again.
I reached out for my baby for some early morning loving
Then the terrible truth came staggering through my head
There was nothing but the fragrance of her perfume on the pillow
Baby wasn't there beside me in the bed.
It's the daybreak and the heartbreak that I found
Only silence to torment me no soft hands to touch me gently
There was nothing to hold on to except the sheets that fell around me
How could that woman leave me she was more than just a lover
She was every bit a lady warm and sweet.
I hope a glass of bourbon can take the pain away
What a good for nothing way to start the day.
It's the daybreak and the heartbreak that I found
Only silence to torment me no soft hands to touch me gently
Lonely is everything you said it would be.
A cup of coffee by myself starts off my day
With eyes so red from crying I can't see
The minutes seem like hours since you went away
You said that I'd be sorry for the things I've done
That someday it would all come back to me
And lonely is everything you said it would be.
The telephone at my house doesn't ring anymore
And there's never any letters left for me
Old friends we knew don't come by like they did before
You said that I'd be sorry for the things I've done
That someday it would all come back to me
Just about the time I pull myself together
When the hurt in me gets better than it's been
Just about the time I feel life's still worth living
Honey comes and honey stays just long enough to tear my mind up
Then she leaves me just the way I knew she would
And I have to start all over start to picking up the pieces
Times like this I almost wish she'd go for good.
Just about the time I'd find myself a new love
When this broken heart she left me starts to mend
Then that's just about the time that I'll be saying
Just about the time I feel life's till worth living
It's funny here comes honey again.
In your letter you said please don't try to find me
Your love is like a chain that ties and binds me
I didn't mean to come on strong believe me
I've just always loved you in a hungry way
And now to think that's causing you to leave me
I'm so confused and hurt by what you say.
If I loved you too much I'm sorry
If I loved you too much and make you go
If I loved you too much forgive me
But I loved you in the only way I know.
If I loved you too much I'm sorry
If I loved you too much and made you sad
If I loved you too much forgive me
Like a bird that's lost it's mate in flight
Like a piece of driftwood on the sea
May you never be alone like me.
I believed the lies you told to me
Now here am I alone and blue
All because I loved no one but you.
When you promised you'd be mine alone
May you never be alone like me.
In the Bible God's own word to say
For every wrong someday you'll pay
I pray the Lord to set me free
May you never be alone like me.
Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set set me free
A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool is blind and just can't see
But I still love her so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms.
Forget about the past and find me somebody new
I thought of everything from A to Z
Once upon a time you and I were so in love
The whole wide world was gay and happy then
I don't know how or why our love began to die
Till it vanished like a straw in the wind.
We're side by side but we're lonely together
Clinging to the pieces of a vow
Everybody used to say we were perfect together
But we're lonely together now.
It's a mighty big roof that we've nailed upon our house
For it stretches from your world to mine
It keeps out the rain but it can't keep out the pain
And the tears that I see falling all the time.
We're side by side but we're lonely together
Clinging to the pieces of a vow
Everybody used to say we were perfect together
But we're lonely together now.
Though you never talked of all ways you were gentle
And life was simple just because you cared
I never thought too much about tomorrow
I just could not imagine you're not here
I wonder what the weather's like in Charleston
Someone said they heard that's where you've gone
I hope it doesn't rain today in Charleston
For I want you always walking in the sun
But I guess the urge to go got out of hand
So you left without a word of explanation
I hope somehow you know I understand
From Monday morning till Friday night
I'm as lonely as can be
Said you'd be good to me
Said our love would never die
Said you'd be good to me
But baby you didn't even try.
From Monday morning till Friday night
Said you'd be good to me
Said our love would never die
Said you'd be good to me
But baby you didn't even try.
When you told me you were leaving me today
You say you've found another you love better
Well it was time for me to move on anyway
All you've done is help to make it easy it was time for me to move on anyway
Thanks for the shelter and the coffee and the softest lips I've ever kissed
Which one will I miss the most I can't say
But that's okay it was time for me to move on anyway
We've had lots of fun just living life together fun but in a deeper kind of way
I guess it's really best that you'll be leaving
Cause it was time for me to move on anyway
I just never heard the door slam from the inside
It was time for me to move on anyway
With the candle light
Besides I don't want to touch that part of life
The days the world belonged to us just us
And I'd telephone at three in the morning
And all sleepy eyed you breathed and sighed
And sometimes we just talked for hours
Dreaming dreams and building towers
All the world was filled with flowers for us
And I'm gonna miss you for a long long time
I can't ever go back to the cabin there
Where I built a fire and held you close
While it snowed outside
And remember you let me sleep all day
So we could love the night away
Oh it just find yesterday and us
I've tried making new friends
Walking new streets and finding new thrills
But nothing new replaces you and it never will
I'll just live my life in memory grateful you once loved me
Thankful that there used to be an us
It just don't take me long to say goodbye
I told you when I met you not to put your chain of love on me too tight
Or you'd look up and find me slipping out into the freedom of the night
I didn't mean to hurt you babe I think you know I ain't that kinda guy
But it just don't take me long to say goodbye
It just don't take me long to change my shirt and call a cab and catch a train
There ain't nothing we can talk about and baby I've got nothing to explain
All I'm taking is my body so don't ever say I left you high and dry
A long time ago when the earth was green
Why there was more kinda animals than you've ever seen
And loveliest of them all was the unicorn.
There was green alligators and long neck geese
Some cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born
The loveliest of all was the unicorn
He said hey brother Noah I'll tell you what to do
And take some green alligators and long neck geese
Some cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born
Don't you forget my unicorn.
He marched in the animals two by two
And he called out as they went through.
Some cats and rats and elephants
And then Noah looked out through the driving rain
Green alligators and long neck geese
The unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried
And that's why you've never seen a unicorn to this very day.
You'll see green alligators and long neck geese
Some cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born
Won't it ever be morning
Won't the dawn ever break
In the shape that I'm in
I love you and miss you so much
It's barely twelve o'clock
But I've already spent a lifetime
Was any time but nighttime.
And I just heard it thunder
Your picture on the wall just laughed at me
Won't it ever be morning
Won't the dawn ever break
In the shape that I'm in
I love you and miss you so much
I love you and miss you so much
He came speeding through the town each day at sundown
And his car was painted candy apple red
He was coming there to see the sheriff's daughter
And the sheriff didn't know it so they said.
Time and time again the sheriff tried to catch him
That old county jail stood patiently a waiting
And the sheriff vowed he'd put him there some day.
If he doesn't slow it down a bit he's gonna end up dead
And the sheriff's daughter said she'd rather end up dead
Than to live without her candy apple red.
So the sheriff built a barricade to catch him
And he sat there at the limits of the town
But the sheriff's daughter had already met him
And she married him before the sun went down.
He saw they couldn't stop and quickly caught his breath
As they crashed the barricade the car exploded
And the boy and girl went to a flaming death.
If he doesn't slow it down a bit he's gonna end up dead
And the sheriff's daughter said she'd rather end up dead
The birthday party was over toys were scattered here and there
Seven candles laid by the last piece of cake in front of an empty chair
A mother said son I know you're disappointed but please
So you go on to sleep now she kissed him and turned out the light
Moments later a window opened and the young boy slipped out
He was on his way to the depot the express wasn't due till ten
The whirl of the wheels and the clang of the steel
Jarred the country side
The southbound freight was running late desperate to make up time
When a giant of a man with a sack in his hand
Leaped off like a mountain lion
He hit and rolled like an old pro and he got up off the ground
He brushed the snow from off his grimy clothes and said
Hey kid what's the name of this town
The man said well what do ya know
Ha I used to live in this little one horse town
I guess about six or maybe it was seven years ago
I told my wife when I left here that I'd be coming back in style
Ha oh well anyway it looks like I'm back I guess
I just might as well visit awhile
So if you'll be so kind as to point the way to the Joneses
Why I'll go now and leave you be
The young boy said sir the only Joneses that live around here
Is my mama and my daddy and me
Course dad he's been gone a long time now
Course now he don't want to be ye understand
It's just that daddy's got lots of important things to do
You see he's a big railroad man
He sends me birthday presents and mama reads me what he writes
In his last letter daddy promised that he was gonna
Try and make it home tonight
The old man scratched the side of his head and he said
Oh well I guess that's natural mistake
Now if you'll just point the way to the depot
Why I'll be checking on the next fast freight
Tell you what you run on home now and you tell your mom
To go ahead and fix up your daddy's room
Wish that I was on old Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bills.
Once I had a girl on Rocky Top
Part bear the other part cat
Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop
I still dream about that.
Home sweet home to me
Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top
Reckon they never will
Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top
Ground's too rocky by far
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar
Home sweet home to me
I've had years of cramped up city life
Trapped like a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a pity life
Can't be simple again.
Home sweet home to me
All day long there's been water on my face
All day long the phone ain't rung the door ain't knocked
And the mail ain't come
And I'm the biggest bum is the human race.
But tomorrow's gonna be better than today
Winds of love gonna blow the lonely clouds away
I'm gonna find me someone new
I'm gonna wash my brain of you.
Tomorrow's gonna be better than today.
Ain't no man ever missed a woman quite so strong
Flipped his lid the way I did and carried on
Beat my fist on the bedroom wall
Shook the plaster loose in the hall
And the reason for it all my baby's gone.
But tomorrow's gonna be better than today
Winds of love gonna blow the lonely clouds away
I'm gonna find me someone new
I'm gonna wash my brain of you.
Tomorrow's gonna be better than today.
Swear to the world I ain't gonna catch me no more blues
I'm gonna sing like a mockingbird happy love in every word
Forget I ever heard your bad bad news.
And tomorrow's gonna be better than today
Winds of love gonna blow the lonely clouds away
I'm gonna find me someone new
I'm gonna wash my brain of you.
Tomorrow's gonna be better than today.
Yes tomorrow's gonna be better than today
Winds of love gonna blow the lonely clouds away
I'm gonna find me someone new
I'm gonna wash my brain of you.
I need a post I can lean on without it falling a rock I can stand on without it rolling
I need a road I can walk down without it turning
A fire I can feel the glow but not the burning
I don't need love just something to believe in
Where are the lips that told me they'd love me forever
The arms that promised me eternal shelter
Where is the wind that lied to me you'll never be empty
For love is a cherry tree in the land of plenty
But I don't want love just something to believe in
I believed in the sunshine and I saw it turned to rain
I believed in the one I loved but I loved her in vain
Is there no post I can lean on without it falling
No rock I can stand on without it rolling
Is there no road I can walk down without it turning
No fire I can feel the glow but not the burning
I don't want love just something to believe in
It's so nice to meet an old friend
And pass the time of day
And talk about the hometown
A million miles away.
Is the ice still on the river
Are the old folks still the same
And when the morning came
Do they still win all their games
Is the landlord still a loser
Do his signs hang in the hall
Are the young girls still as pretty
Does the laughter on their faces
Still put the sun to shame
Did she mention my name just in passing
And when the talk ran high
Aid the look in her eyes seem far away
Won't you say hello for someone
There'll be no need to explain
In the fury of the moment
When my mind was filled with questions
And my head was filled with doubt
I can still see all the sadness
And the sorrow in your eyes
How can flowers live in darkness
For the blackness I've created
In the world that used to shine
I've wilted all the roses
And I've spoiled all the wine.
Get out your magic pencil
And erase the cloudy skies
Give me back the words
See the sunlight reappearing
Through the shrouds of darkened gloom
As I hear your words forgiving me
And watch the flowers bloom.
Have your arms refused to open
Have you served all your ties
I'd still be on my knees
Give me back the words
I looked over Jordan and what did I see
If you get there before I do
I remember well my brightest day
When Jesus washed my sins away
I'm sometimes up and I'm sometimes down
But still my soul feels heavenly bound
Precious Lord linger near
When my life is almost gone
Hold my hand lest I fall
Lead me on to the light
When the shadows appear
And the day is past and gone
Lead me on to the light
There's a place dear to me
Where I'm longing to be
With my friends at the old country church
Where with mother we went
And our Sundays were spent
With our friends at the old country church.
Precious years of memory
How I long once more to be
With my friends at the old country church.
My thoughts go back to the old country church
That I attended as a boy
You know it's kinda funny how we cling
To old bygone days and bygone places isn't it
Why it seems like only yesterday
That my mother took my childish hand in hers
And led me slowly down that long
Winding path to hear the word of God
And I seem to sense his presence
More strongly there than anyplace I've ever known
And the humming of the bees.
I knew that God was surely there
I knew it just as sure as if he'd laid his hand on my shoulder
And said welcome to my house son
Has brought many heartaches and many tears
I've seen my mother pass onto the
Great beyond and many loved ones have followed
Hearts and tear dimmed eyes
And now in later days as I stroll along
The grassy footpaths to the old country churchyard
And I view the final resting place of my departed kin
I'm consoled by the thought that their sleep is a happy one
There in the place where God and men are one
And once again I seem to hear
The voice of our gentle shepherd saying
Precious years with memory
How I long once more to be
Nearer my God to Thee nearer to Thee in though it be a cross that raises me
Still all my songs shall be nearer my God to Thee
Nearer my God to Thee nearer to Thee
Though like a wanderer the sun come down darkness be over me my rest a stone
Yet in my dreams I'd be nearer my God to Thee
Nearer my God to Thee nearer to Thee
Angels to beckon me nearer my God to Thee
I am weak but Thou art strong
Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long as I walk
Let me walk close to Thee.
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it Jesus is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee
When my feeble life is o'er
Time for me will be no more
Guide me gently safely o'er
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it Jesus is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee
Once I stood in the night with my head bowed down
In the darkness as black as the sea
And my heart felt alone and I cried
From here to the great unknown
Where no one stands alone.
I may live like a queen in a palace so tall
With great riches to call my own
But now there's not a thing in this whole wide world
That's worse than being alone.
From here to the great unknown
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger ever near me
As the sacred past unfolds.
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold.
Fly across the lonely years
And the old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appear.
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners were slain.
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown.
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share.
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
Should you go first and I remain to walk the road alone
I'll live in memory's garden dear with happy days we've known
In spring I'll watch for roses red and shades of lilac blue
In early fall when the brown leaves fall then I'll catch a glimpse of you
Should you go first and I remain to finish with the scroll
We've known so much of happiness yes we've had our cup of joy
And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy
Should you go first and I remain there's one thing I'd have you do
Walk slowly down that long path for soon I'll follow you
I want you to know each step I take so that you may walk the same
For someday down that lonely road you'll hear me call your name
Beyond the sunset oh glad reunion with our dear loved ones who've gone before
Where the morning's so bright and the lamb is the light
There will be peace in the valley for me some day
And the beast from the wild will be led by a child
Our father which art in heaven
There as it is in heaven
And forgive us our debts
As we forgive our debtors
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For Thine is the kingdom
You don't wanna hurt me but you've just gotta have him
Can you really take your rings off without feeling kinda dirty
Can you really kiss him while you're wearing my name
Can you run your fingers all across his body
Little drops of love falling from my eyes
Give you something to remember in your victory over me.
Look how I love you see it falling from my eyes.
I never was a lover like others you have known
But I'll be waiting for you when the great ones have all gone
Never thought I'd miss that little old shack where I was born
Never thought I'd miss that little hick town
But then I never thought I'd wander quite this far away
Or my dreams would get turned quite this upside down
Home and things are heavy on my mind tonight and I'd fly south if only I had wings
This big old world can make you miss the simple life you used to live
Oh what I'd give to just see home and things
Oh the sun was yellow and the grass was green
And the folks they were warm and friendly
And your soul could take a good deep breath of God's fresh air
Home and things are heavy...
Lord you know she's packing up her clothes
And telling me one more time it's the end
It's just that baby's blue again.
When the sky turns green and leaves tumble in the wind
But it's just that baby's blue again.
That took the lives of Mary Jo and little Dan
I don't wanna see no lips
Of all the lips you've ever kissed
I just wanna be your No. 1
I don't need no one to warm me
I don't care who came before me
I just wanna be your No. 1.
All that happened yesterday
Is now a part of history
Let me be your destiny
Let's do what's right for you and me.
I don't wanna try and undo
All the wrong somebody done you
I just wanna be your No. 1.
My whole world revolves around you
Life began the day I found you
I just wanna be your No. 1
I just wanna be your No. 1.
Turn out the light lock the door
And I won't even wonder
Of somebody had a key before.
I just wanna be your No. 1.
I just wanna be your No. 1
Lips are you ready to tremble
Hands are you ready to shake
Eyes get ready to cry
Heart get ready to break.
Is everyone ready to start
Altogether now let's fall apart.
Nerves you'll be going to pieces
Tears you'll stream down my face
Head you'll be spinning around
It's time every one take your place.
We're all in this thing together
Altogether now let's fall apart.
I couldn't keep her from leaving
But heart you let me cheat
Then lips you went and lied.
Does everyone remember his part
Altogether now let's fall apart.
I'm not looking for a sweetheart just a gentle lady friend
Someone I can softly turn to when I need to now and then
I reach over in the corner of my life and I find you waiting there
You're a number I can phone you're a letter I can write
You're my water when I'm thirsty in the middle of the night
You're a warm and tender body you're a woman not a wife
And just knowing you has brightened the corner of my life
There's a special kind of feeling when we're simply touching hands
There's a special kind of comfort knowing someone understands
I'm no knight in shining armor I'll never carry you away
But you're filling up the corner of my life in the nicest kind of way
You're a number I can phone...
There's just no way to tie a river down no way to hold back the wind
I start to hear the strains of a distant melody
And I'm off to sing that old highway song
There's just no way...
Once I met a girl in Colorado and I thought for a chance I'd settled down
Has its own special brand of charm
And it doesn't matter how much I'd like to I can't stay too long in one pair of arms
There's just no way...
I make believe I make believe that you're here with me yes I do
I make believe I make believe that you'll always be my very own yes I do
I guess I'm all wrapped up in a world of make believe
I make believe I make believe every time the phone rings that it's you yes I do
I make believe every time that there's a knock on the door
I make believe it's you yes I do baby
I guess I'm all wrapped up in a world of make believe
And yet faith can move mountains and behind even the darkest cloud the sun can shine
Then I'll be there with you and all of our dreams will come true
I can take a little cement
I can fill in all the rough spots
So they won't even show.
I can mend a roof of shingles
With a hammer and some nails
Your big heartbreak was my mistake
But I did not intend it
I lost my head and words were said
But that's no cause to end it.
I can hand a shaky table
And mend the legs with glue
I can send it down and paint it
So you'd think it was new.
I can mend a shattered window
That a storm has torn apart
But I don't know which way to go
To mend your broken heart.
I see her face everywhere I go on the street
Even at the picture show
And the sweet music on my radio
She left her kiss upon my lips
She left her break within my heart
Only she can set me free
She was on her way out of your life when I found her
Not knowing which way to turn
She's forgotten the feeling of two arms around her
But it didn't take her long to learn.
You had new worlds to conquer so you didn't want her
But don't she look great in the new dress I bought her
And don't she look good when she smiles.
Did you really think you were so all important
She couldn't get by on her own
Did you really think losing you would destroy her
She stuck to her promise and talked to her conscious
She did all she could for a while
Now don't she look good when she smiles.
Don't she look good in a new dress I bought her
And the new way that she wears her hair
She's in a new world and she's not the same girl
She knows now that somebody cares.
You can't believe that the same girl you let go
Could change so in this little while
But don't she look great in a new dress I bought her
And don't she look good when she smiles.
I never knew my mother and the closest that I came
Was a picture that my daddy showed to me
When he held it in two calloused hands and told me son don't cry
This is how the Lord intended things to be
Daddy told me mom grew weaker on the night that I was born
And when daddy told his Maker Lord if it be Thy will please take her
How the good Lord took his wife and gave a son
As a kid I watched my daddy carve a living from the land
Then when nighttime came he held me on his knee
And prayed the Lord would let him live till I became a man
My daddy loved this land the Lord and me
Now I've been through a war where many died and never got a scratch
And enough of dad rubbed off on me to know how I came back
I'm a living proof the man upstairs still lives and cares and answers
If only you'd of happened to me a long time ago
If only you'd of happened to me a long time ago
It's kinda late for me to think of what might have been
But I had so much love to offer you then
If only you'd of happened to me honey way back when
If only you'd of happened to me...
When I rolled into town it was raining
You met the bus but you brought along a friend
You introduced me to him
But I guess I looked right through him
I didn't come all the way to Calgary
Just to see you with another man.
It's a long way out here from Nova Scotia
And your new love wasn't part of my plan
But I knew from your smile you'd be with him for a while
I didn't come all the way to Calgary
Just to see you with another man.
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow for home
I'll try to forget you if I can
I don't stand a chance if I don't know to dance
I didn't come all the way to Calgary
Just to see you with another man.
I didn't come all the way to Calgary
What an urge to be free now
But I'm so used to my chains
I just want my life to change.
And I don't want to stay
In the comfort of my empty yesterdays
If I can't find some peace of mind
I gotta keep moving gotta keep moving.
But that's all I meant to say
No more than I meant a day.
Not possession of my soul
You want someone you can hold.
And I don't want to stay
In the comfort of my empty yesterdays
If I can't find some peace of mind
I gotta keep moving gotta keep moving.
Not after all that we've been through
I never will stop loving you.
I still can't believe it when
I wake up you're not here
I just wander through the house
Sit awhile and stare.
I can't say that I'd change everything
Because after all I'm still just a man
The only promise that I could make
Is just to be the best I can.
And I will do the best I can
If you just come home and stay.
Not after all that we've been through
I never will stop loving you.
A bell's not a bell till you ring it
A song's not a song till you sing it
I believe what the wise men say
Love's not love till you give it away.
And there's nothing like giving love to you
You're my only dream that's ever come true
Love's not love till you give it away.
A kite's not a kite till you fly it
I believe what the wise men say
Love's not love till you give it away.
And there's nothing like giving love to you
You're my only dream that's ever come true
Love's not love till you give it away.
I could count the miles between us now and say
But even after all the roads I've traveled on
We're as close as we were then I'm just gone.
Standing in the wind comparing then to now
And it seems to me I stand a little taller somehow
Though I'm in Portland Maine and you're in San Antone
We're as close as we were then I'm just gone.
It's snowing here where I am today
And it's freezing everything
This almost feels like spring.
Though I'm in Portland Maine
And you're in San Antone
We're as close as we were then
We're as close as we've ever been
I came downstairs and found the morning paper by my plate
I looked across the table and I saw the sweetest face
And she smiled at me and then I heard to say
Do you want sugar in your coffee honey on your toast
Or baby would you rather that I hold you close
Do you want sugar in your coffee or loving warm and sweet
I watched her as she moved and knew that she was heaven sent
I lived again sweet memories in my head
I never knew real happiness or what it really meant
Until my baby turned to me and said
Do you want sugar in your coffee honey on your toast
Or baby would you rather that I hold you close
Do you want fingertips to touch you and kisses on your cheek
Do you want sugar in your coffee or loving warm and sweet
Meantime I'm watching it go.
Clouds in my head they keep crowding my brain
Fair weather thoughts disappear with the rain
I'm chasing rainbows that never remain
Helplessly watching life go.
Poor Cinderella she's bowing her head
Glass slippers. fast asleep under the bed
Sadly I'm watching her go.
Prince charming dressed in disarming disguise
Morning will hear him say his sunshine goodbye
Just the way I used to go.
My Lord it seems I've tried so many things
Walking on crutches and calling them wings
I feel so confined I keep wanting to roam
Looking for a life that won't be so alone
Singing in my soul Lord I want to go home
Cause there's country music in my soul people music for the young and the old
I'll keep on singing a song keep on keeping on cause there's country music in my soul
Well I met a man in Illinois who came to see our show
He brought his wife and all his fourteen kids
Why he took the trouble Lord I guess I'll never know
All I know is I'm sure glad he did
Cause there's country music in my soul...
When the final curtain falls and I go to meet the Lord
And he asks me what I think I'd like to do
Cause there's country music in my soul...
There's country music in my soul
Honey if I'll be a good boy and always say please
If I promise to do all the right things like get down on my knees
Baby I know I acted ugly oh how dumb can I be
But I'm sorry really I'm sorry just look at me see
If I cross my heart and I hope to die to never never hurt you or tell you a lie
Do you want your man to be tender do you want your man to be wild
Do you wanna be treated like a woman or maybe baby like a child
Had you rather go for a day to the mountains or strolling by the rolling sea
Do you want to raise a house full of children or just live alone with me
Do you want your man to be gentle do you want your man to be rough
Do you want my arms all around you or just a quiet kinda love
I wanna spend the rest of my life...
Do you want your man to be tender...
I didn't know that losing her
Would be so hard to take
I never thought her memory
Would be so hard to shake.
Or that just one little flash of her
Could make my day go wrong
Kinda makes me wanna sing
With lots of crying in the beer
With lots of crying in the beer.
It's hard to know the story line
Of a book that's halfway read
And it's hard to leave a love undone
And things all left unsaid.
But it's not so hard to hate yourself
When you've been up all night long
Kinda makes you wanna sing
With lots of crying in the beer
With lots of crying in the beer.
With lots of crying in the beer
As much as I love you I don't understand you oh girl
It's almost as though you prefer me to them just on the fringe of your world
As much as I love you you're costing me part of my mind
What am I supposed to do with the part of me that you
Don't want but part of the time
As much as I love you why do you lock me outside
And only let me in every now and then what are you trying to hide
As much as I love you I don't understand how you think
As much as I love you it's cold on my side of the bed
As much as I love you I'm lying here wondering why
I don't take off my ring
Drink one for me won't ye Charlie
Live it up like we used to do
And plan on staying that way.
We've got a place in the country
I don't go out much anymore
Only place is back and forth to work every day
And plan on staying that way.
And plan on staying that way
And I ain't gonna let it get away.
And plan on staying that way.
Drop around some time Charlie
Give my best to all of the guys
They might laugh and call me square
But ain't a one of them that wouldn't trade places with me
And plan on staying that way.
And plan on staying that way
And I ain't gonna let it get away.
And plan on staying that way.
I know what you do and it drives me insane
No matter what I do you never will change
You just keep denying this thing that you do
I can't sleep at night but you don't seem to care
You won't even listen to what I've got to say
I've known for a long time now that I had to find me a way
To catch you in action so I schemed night and day.
I thought and I thought and I devised me a plan
I knew I had to confront you with the proof in my hand
So I took a recorder and I placed it under your bed
And then I placed the microphone right at your head.
And then I recorded every sound that you made that night
When you hear this there'll never be any doubt anymore
Your pillow don't get wet when I go to bed and weep
Your eyes don't turn red when I don't get my sleep
Your world don't fall apart when my phone don't ring
You say you feel for me but you don't feel a thing.
A little bit of understanding
And a little bit of sympathy
You don't like the clothes I wear and you don't like my friends
You don't like my mama and you don't like my dog
I bet if the truth was known you don't like this song.
A little bit of understanding
And a little bit of sympathy
We made love but where's the love we made
We made love but you couldn't prove it now
Suddenly I feel alone and so afraid
We've looked everywhere that we know
That's where I remember it last
But I don't even see it in your eyes anymore.
The hardest thing for me to believe
Is that you just wake up one day
And the future's part of the past
We made love but where's the love we made.
We went there and couldn't even find it in the wine
I thought we might find it up in the mountains
But it's just disappeared like it never was there
It's a little bit crazy and a little bit sad
But it's more than just a little bit gone.
We made love but where's the love we made
We made love but you couldn't prove it now
Suddenly I feel alone and so afraid
It's not that I can't get up in the morning
And go fry myself an egg
On the scratch on my leg.
It's not that I can't iron a shirt
And sweep up dirt and feed the bird
All the little things you used to do
It's not that I can't organize the checkbook
It's not that I might be sleeping in the house
And I can water all the plants
And mend my pants and spray for ants
All the things I never had to do
I'm just gonna have to take my life
And do a little rearranging
A man can adjust to anything
Except to have a rock down in his shoe
I may be the only man on this whole block
Who's the lady of the house
But someone's gotta stay and float a ship
When the captain's bailing out.
So you go on and have your fun
And worry none and listen hon
I'm just gonna have to take my life
And do a little rearranging
A man can adjust to anything
Except to have a rock down in his shoe
Let's close the door and pull the shades
And listen to the winter rain grow quiet
As it's turning into snow
Let's pull out some records that
We haven't played in much too long
Would sure sound good again.
I almost forgot how much I love you
Let's make it the best it's ever been
Throw another log on the fire
Don't let the flame die again.
I know we could make it
It's ours so let's take it
Let's make it the best it's ever been
Let's make it the best it's ever been.
We haven't been as close
To one another as we used to be
Instead of making love
But I'll go back to working at it
If you'll help me do it.
Come down on the floor and lie beside me
Let's make it the best it's ever been.
Throw another log on the fire
My mama loved my dad for fifty years
She worked along beside him in the fields
He never gave her much but he gave her all he had
Dad's the only reason my mama lived.
Mama's face would light up like a diamond
Each time my daddy just walked in the room
She'd stop what she was doing and put her arms around him
Dad's the only world my mama knew.
Mama never saw her roses bloom
That year the angels came before the robin's song
When mama left she left dad a lonely man
But he talked to mama like she was still here
And the good times that they'd had.
As his old mind slipped back across the years
Daddy never plowed his fields again
He just sat down to wait his time to come
And he closed his eyes and went to live with mom
That they were here for me to love
If I could have just been there
And seen my mama's face
When my dad walked in.
If I could have only seen my mama's face
About a woman who wakes him up every morning and loves him
Scrambles his eggs and unscrambles his life butters his toast with a golden knife
Bears his kids and nearly bout all of his burdens
I've been out half of the night and I'm hung over
No one to love and make me happy call me baby or call me pappy
About the woman who serves him love on a silver platter
I look in the mirror and I wonder what's the matter
Gonna find me a bluebird let him sing me a song
Cause my heart's been broken much too long
Gonna chase me a rainbow through a heaven of blue
There was a time my love was needed my life completed my dreams come true
Then came the time my life was haunted my love unwanted all for you
Gonna find me a bluebird...
The leaves have changed from green to golden at least one time and maybe two
All I know is I feel a hundred years older and I still feel the same about you
Time hasn't been the great physician and healed my hurt like it's supposed to do
I've given everything a man can give it
You can outrun it outgrow it or try to just outlive it
I've got to sign on the radio station I'm what's known as a country DJ
Ain't exactly what you call a gourmet breakfast but rich boys don't play country DJ
Earphones microphones telephones backbones just about to break now any day
Lord have mercy on a country DJ
News machine must've run out of paper last thing I have is the midnight report
Earphones microphones...
Turntable's ready got my records at hand
Howdy there friends out in the radio land
Earphones microphones...
Are you sure that Ralph Emery and Charlie Douglas got started this way
I tell you I have to do everything around here
Sign on sign off pick up records pick up trash cut commercials
Cut the grass carry out orders carry out garbage answer to the boss
I tell you what I'm gonna get a real job
She's still the angel that I knew before the only difference now is she's mine
In an apron or a nightgown or the wedding dress she wore
She's a perfect angel all the time
You know it's funny how when you first meet a girl
All made up her hair just right dressed nicely
And you just assume she's like that 24 hours a day
And then you stop and think about it
Ever since I met you you run me like a flag up and down the pole
Then kicked me out to sleep in the cold
I gave all the love that I knew how to give I stood faithfully by your side
But Lord it's been a roller coaster ride
And just about to lose my crazy mind
And within your arms she thinks she'll find the pot of gold
Talk to me Ohio can't you hear my song
A Greyhound bus in Macon took her to Atlanta
The Silver Bird to Cleveland then I lost her track
I've looked in every honky tonk from Akron to Columbus
From Dayton to Toledo Ohio give her back
If she wakes up tomorrow and bathes among your flowers
Walk beside your waters and feels your gentle breeze
She'll want to stay and sleep inside your loving arms forever
And if she does Ohio who's to sleep with me
Let me be the one to walk with you when you want somebody to talk with you
Anything that makes you happy I want to do darling let me be the one
Let me be the one who means the most the one you want to love and call your own
And when you choose a partner I wanna be the choice please let me be the one
Let me be the one to take you out to your favorite places you have no doubt
And when the evening's gone put a kiss goodnight you gotta let me be the one
Let me be the one to share with you all your little pleasures and sorrows too
In all kinds of weather I just wanna be with you darling let me be the one
Let me be the one to hold your hand when the preacher says do you take this man
To a boy who grew up walking in the woods and the fields of South Carolina
And to a kid who ain't never heard a noise a whole lot louder than a freight train
I get scared sometimes just standing here along the street
Concrete concrete everywhere I turn there's concrete
Found in the pavement day after day I wanna go home
Where the sun shines and the tall pines and the earth and the heavens meet
I'd rather starve on a poor dirt farm than to stay here surrounded by the concrete
I'm cursed with the body of a man and the heart of a child
They asked me to write a story describing the loveliest sight I've ever seen
And I wrote your name
They asked me to write a song and set all my dreams to music
And I did I wrote it again
For you are my story you are my song loving you baby all night long
You are my story you are my song loving you baby all night long all night long
No story or no song could ever do justice to you and what you do for me
When I started out to write this song
I was gonna write about how much a woman's love can help a man
Before I even got my guitar out
I don't feel that way about it now
A man don't need his back or his brain loaded down with someone else
And when it starts to raining he don't have to find a shelter
But thank the Lord the wind came up and blew a little common sense
Across the sandy deserts of my mind
Now I can leave you standing here and never shed a tear
She was on her way out of your life when
I found her not knowing which way to turn
She's forgotten the feeling of two arms around her
But it didn't take her long to learn.
You had new worlds to conquer so you
But don't she look great in the new dress I bought her
And don't she look good when she smiles.
Did you really think you were so all important
She couldn't get by on her own
Did you really think losing you would destroy her
She stuck to her promise and talked to her conscious
She did all she could for a while
Don't she look good in a new dress I bought her
And the new way that she wears her hair
She's in a new world and she's not the same girl
She knows now that somebody cares.
You can't believe that the same girl you let go
Could change so in this little while
But don't she look great in a new dress I bought her
And don't she look good when she smiles.
And don't she look good when she smiles...
You say you're gonna leave me pack up and go
You don't wanna hurt me but you've just gotta have him
Can you really take your rings off without feeling kinda dirty
Can you really kiss him while you're wearing my name
Can you run your fingers all across his body
I knew this morning as soon as the phone rang
That crazy woman had hurt you again
That's why I told you to come on over
Did my baby spend another sleepless night
Let mama love your pain away and make everything alright.
If she don't love you why don't she
Let a real woman light your fire
Your too big a boy to go to bed hungry
And the way that I need you
I could feed you anything your heart desires.
Did my baby spend another sleepless night
Let mama love your pain away and make everything alright.
I make believe I make believe that you're here with me yes I do
I make believe I make believe that you'll always be my very own yes I do
I guess I'm all wrapped up in a world of make believe
I make believe I make believe every time the phone rings that it's you yes I do
I make believe every time that there's a knock on the door
I make believe it's you yes I do baby
I guess I'm all wrapped up in a world of make believe
And yet faith can move mountains and behind even the darkest cloud the sun can shine
Then I'll be there with you and all of our dreams will come true
On the banks of the river by the railroad track
We kept chickens in a pen in the back
My daddy was a farmer but all he ever raised was us
Salvation Army give us clothes to wear
A man from the county came to cut our hair
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
That was ten dollar less than the landlord wanted for rent
The landlord's letters got nasty indeed
He wrote get out but pa couldn't read
And we was too broke to even pay heed
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
But we had something in our house money can't buy
Kept us warm in the winter cool when the sun was high
For whenever we didn't have food enough
We patched the cracks and set the table with love
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to you
They're not teardrops
They're I love you drops
They were on my pillow when I woke up this morning
They were on the letter I tried all day to write
And just a little while ago I saw them
Falling on your picture as I kissed it goodnight.
You've been gone so long drops.
They're not teardrops
That say I'm lonesome
Never knew this heart could hurt the way it hurts for you
Never lived so many lifetimes in a week
Why don't you come back to me the way you said you would
And kiss these little crystals off my cheek.
You've been gone so long drops.
They're not teardrops
That say I'm lonesome
Your love is heavenly sunshine you fill my heart with your sweet love so divine
Heavenly Sunshine Heavenly Sunshine you make me happy because your love is mine
I touch Heaven when your arms reach to hold me tight
A sense of freedom fills my veins I get the fever
Every time I sparrow flies up into the endless skies
Something down inside me cries I get the fever
I get the fever to pack up and leave here wander wild like the wind
Every time I hear a buddy say he's put lots of dust and clay
Between him and yesterday I get the fever
I get the fever to pack and leave here and I think maybe I'll do just that tomorrow
Everywhere I turn there's pain and sorrow
Every time I hear a buddy say he's put lots of dust and clay
Between him and yesterday I get the fever
The bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights.
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights.
The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
Did the God who put those stars above make those city lights
Did he make a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
Are we just supposed to run and hide behind those city lights.
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
What a wonderful thing that our love would have been tomorrow
What a pity that our dreams didn't stay around to see tomorrow
But your love has gone away and our dreams vanished too
Starved for so many things I intended to do
I'm alone with a love I meant to give to you tomorrow
I'll be the woman that you want tomorrow I got to many things to do today
Tomorrow I'll have lots of time to love you and I let it go another day
I promised all the love you'd need tomorrow
Say all the words you crave to hear me say
And somewhere in your lonely waiting hours
You packed your hungry heart and went away
What a wonderful thing our love would have been tomorrow
What a pity our dreams didn't stay around to see tomorrow
But your love has gone away and our dreams vanished too
Starved for so many things that I intended to do
I'm alone with a love meant to give you tomorrow
Yes you're gone today and our dream gone astray
There were still so many things that I intended to do
I happened to walk into a honky tonk
One night down in New Orleans
Up above the bar hung a big guitar
Like none I'd ever seen.
The neck was set with diamonds
And though the strings were old
Like Kings of sound they wound around
Six keys of solid gold.
A man stepped up beside me
His breath was strong with wine
He said you know that guitar once belonged
To a mighty close pal of mine.
He used to play it right here
If you'd care to buy me a drink.
That takes a man a fool
And then he rocked back on his stool.
He just returned from the Great War
His buddies gave him that guitar
At the time it was simple and plain
He added the gold and the diamonds
As he played his way to fame.
He was doing a show in Shreveport
The night he received a call
The greatest show at all.
I was driving him to Nashville
It was cold and misting rain
The signals flashed and the whistle screamed
I swear Mister I never saw that train.
I heard the doctor tell him
Just after he used his knife
You're lucky son it was just your arm
It could have been your life.
More than he could give
He just lost his will to live.
But this world's loss is heaven's gain
And tonight he's still a star
He plays with a band of angels
At my door the leaves are falling the cold wild wind will come
Sweet hearts world bide together but I still miss someone
I go out on a party to look for a little fun
And I miss the arms that held me when all the love was there
I wonder if he is sorry for leaving what we begun
And the someone somewhere for me but I still miss someone
At my door the leaves are falling the cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts world bide together but I still miss someone
The world needs a melody it can sing sing sing sing now let's all sing together
In the sweet bye and bye we shall meet on that beautiful shore together
The world needs a bell it can chime chime chime chime
The world needs a drum to keep the time
The world needs a melody it can sing sing sing sing now let's all sing together
The world needs a reason to clap it hands
The world needs a leader for its band
The world needs a melody that it can sing sing sing sing now let's all sing together
In the sweet bye and bye give us that old time religion
In the sweet bye and bye give us that old time religion
On the poor side of Fort Worth in a rundown motel
A rodeo cowboy held a young Texas belle
He scooped up some peanuts right out of the can
And he whispered as he placed them in the palm of her hand
Baby I wish they were diamonds and this was north Dallas
And I wish oh I wish you were mine oh I wish Lord I wish you were mine
On the north side of Dallas in a forty roomed house
She remembers her cowboy as she takes off her blouse
She fingers the diamonds that cling to her breast
Her teardrops fall freely as she looks to the west
And I wish oh I wish he was mine oh she cries Lord I wish he was mine
Cowboys and rich girls just don't live in the same world
I came to see the blue pacific in the night
And almost empty bottle of rose sits on the table
Like the echo of a sweet and gentle song
I never stop and wonder why I came to California
But I often wonder why I took so long
And surely not the place her man has gone meanwhile back in Cleveland life goes on
And I hope I didn't soak up too much sun
We started once to take a boat to Catalina Island
There's gonna be the screaming Sunday night at Universal
And a party up at Roger's place till dawn
I never stop and wonder why I came to California
And it's gonna be another lonely night
And I'm sorry and I hope that she's alright
Let me whisper darling one more time let the soft curves of your body cling to mine
Let me feel you through and through I can't get enough of you
Let me whisper darling oner more time
Stay with me and let me take you farther and higher than you've ever dared to climb
And I know you've got somebody else and I know you've got to go but before you do
Let me whisper darling...
The night's almost over but I'm not ready to let you go
Your love blows me away like a breeze blows across the meadow
Like a trade wind blows across the bay your love blows me away
Your love shows me a world most men have never seen or dreamed of
Your love brings me a song no one else could ever sing a song of sweet love
Loving you takes my breath away till there's nothing left to say
Unless I could say hey your love blows me away...
Watching the stars fall from the skies
We must have closed our eyes cause now it's morning
Kissing the dew from your face I fall into your embrace where it's so warm
Loving you takes my breath away...
As I lay here by my woman I know I'm back where I belong again
But we used commonsense to work it out we quit before the word got out
But we used commonsense...
Liars one believers zero
Liars two believers zero
I see the look in her eyes and I know that she believes
Before the night is over she'll give herself to me
I'll hold her close and I'll kiss her lips tell her I love her so
Liars three believers zero
Hey honey I'm home I had to work all night with the job like mine that's how it goes
Liars four believers zero
But wait she's not here she's gone with all her things
She found she couldn't beat me so she started her own game
I've checked the house and I've called her friends where she's gone nobody knows
You're a thousand miles away from me tonight and Lord I miss you so
You could be in someone else's arms right now and I would never know
But I'll go lay me down to sleep and never let it cross my mind
We've got it all we've got it all there's nothing else I could need we've got it all
We're lovers and we're friends through good and bad thick and thin
I said it once and I'll say it again we've got it all
I watched the sun go down this afternoon and paint the city's face all red
Then I wished upon a silver star that crept into the pink sky overhead
And I told myself that someday I won't have to go and leave you all alone
Then I wrote your name upon a frosted window pane and then I wrote this song
How did a cowboy in rough outs and wranglers end up in New York alone
When does the next plane take off for Dallas sweet Texas I'm coming home
For the love of my homeland is deeper than even the cold snow that lies at my feet
There's a big rodeo out in San Angelo somebody save me a seat
Bathe me with sunshine sing San Antonio Rose sweet Texas
Talk to me gently for you are a lady sweet Texas
You're a woman and a lover and home to my wandering soul sweet Texas
And I'm gonna hold her and waltz across Texas till the moon and the stars disappear
And the next time the man says go north for your fortune
I'll tell him my fortune's right here
Sunday morning in the valley we would gather for the service
You would always run to meet me you'd smile at papa kinda nervous
All the people came from miles around and I can still hear the sound
As they sang thanks to the Lord for the sun up in the sky
Thanks to the Lord for the crops and for the farm
And I say thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks to the Lord for a girl like you
Come the day that we were married with all our folks from the congregation
Honey you looked just like an angel the sweetest thing in all creation
Papa hugged me and my mama cried everybody smiled with pride
As they sang thanks...
But sometimes I feel like I've just got to get away
From the same old existence day after day
Sometimes I long for a warm tender kiss
Just to see if there's anything I might have missed
And it's beginning to feel like this might be one of those sometimes
Those one times in a lifetime
I'm aching to hold you kiss and console you drive you right out of your mind
But I know when I do I won't get over you for quite sometimes
There's a circle in a triangle it's a shining little band of gold
You're the one who put it on her finger
Yeah but it's your hand I long to hold
That tiny circle it's the tie that binds me
It's there to remind me you'll never be mine
For that circle in a triangle three hearts in a tangle that'll never unwind
But there's a circle in a triangle three hearts in a tangle hers yours and mine
I've had a long streak of a bad luck but I pray it's gone at last
I've had a long streak of a bad luck but I pray it's gone at last
Well I ain't dumb I kicked around some I have thought too easily
But that boy looked so deductive he just grabbed my sympathy
Sweet little woman what's your problem tell me why you're so down cast
I've had a long streak of a bad luck but I pray it's gone at last
Once in awhile from out of nowhere at least expected and we ran to pair
Somebody will come and lift you higher and your burdens will be shared
I do believe if I hadn't met you I might still be sinking fast
I've had a long streak of a bad luck but I pray it's gone at last
But I pray it's gone at last
Tonight in the darkness I was awakened by a knock at the door
But you're back and I still can't believe I'm seeing you once more
God it's been so lonely without you where you've been
Darling I missed you so won't you come walk with me
There's some place we must go there's something you must see
You're forgiving me for hurting you why I can see it in your eyes
And as you take my hand we're walking just as we used to do
Where you're taking me won't it ever be surprise it doesn't matter
Just as long as I'll never again be without you
Darling I missed you so...
Why you're leading me down those same green summer lanes
That we so often walked together
And I'm so happy it's all like a dream come true
There's that tree we used to sat under it all comes back to me now
If I kiss you tonight when the sun comes up tomorrow can we still be friends
If I take you in my arms and if you become another can we still be friends
Can we still laugh and talk can we still hold hands and walk
Through the magic world that we've been living in
Can we still be friends
I've seen so many couples fall in love with each other
And the beautiful friendship ends
And I've just got to know before I give myself completely can we still be friends
Can we still laugh and talk can we still hold hands and walk
Well it'd still be as tender as it's been
That's what made me love you that's what made me love you
There ain't no way that time can make a bad thing out of our love
In a hundred years I'll think back and I'll have the memory of
That's what made me love you that's what made me love you
Without your arms around me the world's a lonely place
Please don't look too close when you're looking to my face
I wanna do my thing with you and if I can't do with you I'll do without
You know the last time I saw you was that when you came in
And said that you didn't want to live with me anymore
But honey I was in your arms five minutes before I knew I made a big mistake
And you just don't know how many nights I've laid awake in a big cold bed
Without your arms around me...
Good evening dear how did things go did you have a good day today
I hope she doesn't notice that traces of Mary's lipstick that I just light away
Okay I guess but that dog's gotta go but he always gets in my way
That's the good dinner dear think I'll have a beer maybe it'll help me unwind
I'm so tired think I go to bed remember to turn out the lights
I really am tired but it's not from the work and I hope he's as tired as I am tonight
Well goodnight have a good sleep wake me on time won't you dear
I almost slipped up and called to Mary I hope that she didn't hear
Goodnight honey please don't worry I'll wake you in time for your bus
But I know about Mary and we're just one big happy family Charlie Mary and us
I can't sleep with you I can't sleep with you
I can't sleep with you on my mind
Here I lay in bed tossing and turning
The fires of love we once knew are still burning
I can't sleep with you I can't sleep with you
I can't sleep with you on my mind
I've tried everything I know to help my sleeping
But sleep won't come to eyes that burn from weeping
I can't sleep with you I can't sleep with you
I can't sleep with you on my mind
I have all the empty hours I can stand
Life is nothing to a woman without a love of her sweet man
And it seems like the nights just get longer and longer all the time
Let me take you away let me take you away love there's still time let me take you away
Did he kiss you when he got back home
No he just came in and opened up a beer and sat down by the TV alone
Did she wear something sexy to bed
No she just took off her makeup rolled up her hair reached for a book and just read
Let me take you away let me take you away love there's still time let me take you away
Yes we were not gonna find out who we are
Let me take you away let me take you away
Love there's still time let me take you away
And I saw him at the counter looking lonesome at the rain
I sat down beside him and I ordered us some coffee
Hello city country is my name and I'm here to play your city game
I saw there in his eyes such a pure and simple beauty
That could not have been bred upon these dark and dingy streets
I liked the look he gave me and I asked him if he'd stay
Maybe for a while till I get back on my feet and I sure could use a place to sleep
Lay lay country lay on my mind
For deep inside these city lies a whole lot of country in me
A whole lot of country in me
And the nights we spent in each other's arms
But time brought a change that brought him tossed and tumbled sleep
I've gotta go make sure they're safe and warm
I woke up this morning and I opened up my eyes
But I had dreams and feelings that would always keep me happy
Even though I knew I wouldn't see him anymore so I just let him close the door
Lay lay country lay on my mind...
It was my first time to cheat I think she knew
She seemed to know my each and every move
She unlocked the door and gently led me through
What we're taking here tonight
You can't call it stealing when it's been thrown away
Unwanted love left lying will bloom again some day
We found each other lonely baby
Don't that make it right
What we're taking here tonight
I only want the part of you that's cold from her neglect
I'll warm the spot inside your arms he carelessly rejects
We both need the sunshine baby
To brighten up our lives
What we're taking here tonight
You gave me just enough of you to make me want it all
You held me in your arms just tight enough to make me tremble
And the sexy way you looked at me drove me up the wall
I thought for sure I'd die and gone to heaven when you kissed me
You gave me just enough of you to make me want it all
I went home and went to bed and laid awake till morning
And I stared at the telephone just wishing you would call
I've got to slip away with you and feed this gnawing hunger
You gave me just enough of you to make me want it all
You gave me just enough to make me want it all
To lie with you and reach inside and touch your very soul
I'd follow you to anywhere I'd walk I'd run I'd crawl
You gave me just enough of you to make me want it all
I've been loving you too long it's time I sang a different song
You've been stringing me along I've been loving you too long
I've been clinging like a vine but I'm gonna take the time
To find where I belong I've been loving you too long
Babe I'm not saying that I've stopped loving you
That it won't be hard to say goodbye
I've been loving you too long...
No one owns another one and that's what you try
You tried to own me body mind and soul
Children be careful when playing with matches
The neighbors are cooking out in the backyard
Building fires strong desires
We've got to be careful there's too many people
Just down the street building fires
Now smoking in bed can sure burn your house down
Specially if you're there with somebody's wife
Temptation knocks and most people answers just neighborly lovers unsatisfied
Building fires strong desires...
One two three stop it's time to change partners
You go get your good thing and I'll go get mine
Temptation knocks and most people answers
Just neighborly lovers yearning for more and more
Building fires strong desires...
We've got to be careful there's too many people
We're acting like babies little bitty babies
And we're about to throw away a lifetime of good good loving
Love is not a game love is not a toy I'm not a little girl and you're not a little boy
But if we're not careful we're gonna destroy
A fairy tale that might have come true
By acting like children little bitty children
And we're about to throw away a lifetime of good good loving
Once upon a time we didn't fight everything was beautiful everything was right
And we make love instead of war every night
And I wanna go back to the good times
Stop acting like children little bitty children
We're acting like babies little bitty babies
Where are you going Billy boy where are you going Billy Boy
I'm going to Atlanta let this farm just run on down
It's made all it can make but it don't go around
Do you want to go with me Mary Lou do you want to go with me Mary Lou
I'm not sure I could live there I don't have no city ways
And it's hard to leave where I was born and raised
Look at all those buildings Billy boy I think I'm gonna like it Billy boy
Look at all the bright lights the night seems just like day
It makes the farm seem so far away
Where are you going Mary Lou you're not going out again tonight are you
New dress just to sit and watch TV
I'm going out and let the town see me
Where are you going Billy boy where are you going Billy Boy
I'm going home back to that rundown farm
Where all the dirt is used for growing corn
Used words like love words like hate and words we didn't mean
We've put it down we've patched it up we both have had our say
Neither one of us was always right neither one was always strong
We never put I love you in the place where it belonged
When one was up the other was down and love can't grow that way
You'll find a love to take my place and I'll find me someone
For when it's all been said and done more was said than done
So you take yours and I'll take mine
We'll go our separate ways
Your hair is soft your eyes are bright your nose is small your mouth is right
Your skin is smooth your waist is small
Your legs are curved you've got dainty feet I love it all
Head to toe can't you see I love you head to toe I can't get enough of you
I told you now you know I love you head to toe
Your sparkling eyes they shine with love your hungry lips can't get enough
Your loving arms they're clinging vines
Your body's warm and when we're close I know it's mine
My feet don't have much use for a new pair of shoes
And I recall there was a time I used to hate to dance
But I'm glad I gave them all a second chance
This time we'll make our bed on higher ground
Once is not enough and goodbye is not the end
How many times did we go see Gone With The Wind
We held on darling we held on baby we hold on to what we had
They couldn't break us up baby
We held on baby we held on baby we held on to what we had
One two three you and me baby we held on to what we had
And where you're gonna fall
But that was fifteen long years ago
We're still together now baby we held on...
Now they came after us from the left and the right
We had to put up one heck of a fight
We held on baby we held on...
This is a song about a girl from
The bayou down in Louisiana country
The story simply says
She left home at sixteen
Said she was gonna be a movie queen
Said her hometown was just too small
And she had roaches and rats wall to wall
So without a bag of beans she made a change of scenes
Hitched a ride up to New Orleans
With just the clothes on her back and a little brown sack
Said hello to the city where she would learn to act
Gonna be a movie queen gonna be on the big wide screen
Fancy clothes and diamond rings have all the better things
She took a part time job at the Burger King
So she decided she'd have to leave New Orleans
Hollywood bound but with her feet on the ground
When she got to the city she took a look around
Said gonna be a movie queen gonna be on the big wide screen
Fancy clothes and diamond rings have all the better things
Oh but things didn't work out that way
They found her dead in her room today
But in my mind I can hear her say
I can still hear her say
Gonna be a movie queen gonna be on the big wide screen
We've been together since way back when sometimes I never want to see you again
But I want you to know after all these years
You're still the one I want whispering in my ear
You're still the one I wanna talk to in bed still the one that turns my head
I looked at your face every day but I never saw it till I went away
Then winter came I just wanted to go deep in the desert I longed for the snow
You're still the one that makes me laugh still the one that's my better half
You're still the one that makes me strong still the one I wanna take along
Still the one I love to touch still the one and I can't get enough
You're still the one that can scratch my itch you're still the one and I wouldn't switch
You are still the one who makes me shout still the one that I dream about
Sometimes she's a child I love her that way her little girl smile just begging to play
But when I'm confused and when I am weak
She rocks me gently takes me to her bosom
My beautiful spider spinning her web of velvet and steel
Blow in my mind like a soft evening breeze she's patient and kind so anxious to please
But she's like a storm if she needs to be
Like a tornado wiping out anything that gets in her way she does it for me
Mama never got to rock us mama never got to love us
But papa rocked and loved us night and day
Mama never got to sing to us mama never got to teach us
But papa taught us what and not to say
And I can still remember every cold December red roses in the snow on mama's grave
And twin little boys in overalls with big brown eyes watched their papa cry
Mama died when we were born and folks say papa never would've lived on
Except mama told him how she wanted us raised
Our papa was a good man with a light heart and a heavy hand
And he kept us well in line throughout our childhood days
Cause sometimes papa's thoughts would just sorta drift away
He raised us just like mama asked
Got us ready for the future and gave us a happy past
And then on our twenty first birthday papa passed away
Mama never got to rock us...
He stopped at the bar on his way to the bandstand
To strengthen his courage and weaken his pride
On an old paper napkin he wrote me this message
When the snow's over Mister could I see you outside
To look on his face said it's no laughing matter
I nodded and cautiously walked to the door
Clutching my sleeve he said Mister it's Jackie
She left me and said she won't be back no more
Please sing a love song for Jackie sing it on record and on the TV
She's always said you were her favorite singer
And she listened to you fore she listened to me
Please tell Jackie I love her tell her I'm dying without her it's true
Please sing a love song for Jackie
So Jackie wherever you are and whatever you're doing right now
I want you to know this song's for you
Jackie it's wrong don't you leave him he can't live without you any fool can see
This is my love song for Jackie
Don't hurt him Jackie you don't know how much he loves you
That ever drove a truck
And every guitar picker whoever chased a dream
And ended up in a motel room
She's been my pillow when
I've needed a place to lay my weary head
She's been my blanket when the ground
Beneath my body was my only bed
She's been the table W
I've shared the gravy and the grind
She's been my traveling companion
When the road stretched out in front of me for miles
She's had to catch my salty tears
But she's been around to see my happy smiles
I sing her my songs in their infancy
And she listens patiently
I've carried her and she's carried me
And the people who don't know say
And I guess if you ain't been there
You might not understand it but it's my case
She's been my traveling companion
When the road stretched out in front of me for miles
She's had to catch my salty tears
But she's been around to see my happy smiles
I've carried her and she's carried me
And when I die just bury me in
Someday we're gonna get away and spend some time together
Someday I'll hold you in my arms and not just my dreams
But as much as I want to love you and feel what lies in store
You're like a present with a pretty ribbon shining on a birthday morn
And I'm like a little boy who can't wait to untie the bow
But until the grapes are ripened and the wine is ready to pour
I can tell you're well worth waiting for everyday only makes me want you more
It's hard to stand outside and wait this close to heaven's door
I can't take any longer baby I mean I can't wait any longer
To hold you to feel you our lives have touched our minds have touched
Satisfy my hunger you're the only one who can
Where do I have to go what do I have to do
Who do I have to lie to so I can lie with you I can't wait any longer
Patience has never been one of my virtues baby when I want something I want it now
And I want you now I wanna kiss you now I wanna love you now
I can't wait any longer...
When I first saw you I saw something I hadn't seen in a long long time
I saw a lady who looked like a woman who could drive me right out of my mind
But I also saw your diamond and your golden wedding band
I know you're married but I've gotta ask you how married are you Mary Ann
Are you so married that you can't see me looking at you with hungry eyes
Are you so married that you'd deny me just one night in paradise
I wanna hold you I wanna kiss you I wanna love you all I can
I know you're married but I've gotta ask you how married are you Mary Ann
How married are you Mary Ann how much of a chance do I stand
On a scale of one to ten how married are you Mary Ann
Surely surely you can see me trembling trembling to hold you tight
I'm not talking about forever I'm just talking about tonight
I wanna touch you I wanna watch you slip that diamond off of your hand
How married are you Mary Ann...
My roads have been rocky and the women's been rough
I woke up this morning and I'd just had enough
When I get to her sweet arms I won't feel alone
She don't have no mountain that I cannot climb
She don't want to own me body and mind
Her roads are not winding like some I've been on
Smooth smooth southern highway smooth and going down my way
When I get to her sweet arms I won't feel alone
And suddenly it was yesterday and I was lying in your arms
And somehow just the thought of you turned my world on and made me warm
When I'm like a leaf in the wind you're an oak tree beside me
Lifting your branches to make sure I don't blow away
And when I'm like a rolling stone you're the Rock of Gibraltar
Steadfast and mighty and I ask myself every day
What did I ever do to deserve you Joanna
The warmth of your sweet lips the touch of your hand
What did I ever do to deserve your sweet loving
You took a baby and made him a man what did I ever do to deserve you Joanna
I wonder where I'd be right now if you hadn't found me
Asleep in a bunk gutter stoned nearly out of my mind
Instead I wake up every day to my own private rainbow
What did I ever do...
There was justice in his sixgun there was magic in his name
I stood in line to see him ride across our small town screen
And in my mind's eye I rode with him in every scene
And he would ride off in the sunset with that friendly western smile
Ride off in the sunset no goodbyes just so long for awhile
I saw him on a talk show not too many years ago
His voice was kinda shaky and his hair was white as snow
He didn't say goodnight folks just waved his hat up in the air
And I told my young son that's my childhood hero there
He would ride off in the sunset...
I read the evening paper out in my backyard yesterday
I looked out toward the sunset and I saw a golden screen
And I swear I saw him as he played out his final scene
Whiskey can't sing and whiskey can't write
I had it all but I lost everything
But I guess I started bending my elbow more than I should
I sang a duet with Johnnie Walker Red and I said don't that sound good
Then before I could find a word to rhyme with wine
I was out of my mind all the time
My throat got too wet my pen got too dry and my music died on the vine
He walked into a pawnshop with a ring of gold and watch of silver
Then he continued east on Broad Street on his way down to the river
He stopped at Third on Broad dropped his envelope in a mailbox
A hundred bucks from Maud his old friend from the Broadway nightspot
The world had passed him by and he had nothing more to give her
So he continued east on Broad Street on his way down to the river
He stopped at First on Broad he saw the barges and the bridge
Some say it was on purpose while some others beg to differ
On the last day of Christmas I start thinking about the summer son
The beauty of the roses the sweet song of the robin
The warmth of the yellow summer sun
And the two of us together running through the meadow
It's a long way back to winter and the plane that came from Denver
We'll fly your kite and ride your bike maybe camp out overnight
And I'll take you to a Big League baseball game
And hopefully we'll have some time to talk about what's on your mind
And maybe I can even help you some
Where you need your dad a lot this summer son
And I'll be there just like the summer sun
Like so many single fathers I live just to see the summer sun
Who you are and what you can become
Broken homes aren't easy but think about it this way
You've got two homes where you've loved instead of one
So be a good boy don't you cry and tell your mama I said hi
I looked over my guitar and there stood an old man
His cowboy clothes were frayed and worn and his boots were far from new
He said I'd like to sit in with your band I'm a country singer too
Well we just had a big laugh
And when I looked back at the old man there was a tear in his eye
I told the band to cool it I didn't wanna see him cry
He reached down and he took my guitar with a determined look on his face
But as he started to play and sing a look of sadness took its place
He said I've sang my songs from Maine to California
Seen the world through the window of a car
I never saved a dime back when I made it I always thought someday I'd be a star
But now my voice is cracked and no one wants me my wife gave upon me years ago
I wonder if God likes country music will there be a place up there to sing my songs
Will he make my fingers nimble like they used to be
So I can play the chords and sing along
I just stood there none of us really knew what to say
He took my guitar and he put it down ever so gently
And then as he started to turn and leave
The band stood up and applauded and I can still hear his words today he said
As your fingers on my back or seen anything as pretty
As that long beautiful hair dripping down around your shoulders
Oh I know some men will tell you anything in the dark
And then when the sun comes up they can't even tell you your name
But I'm not like that trust me
You're special and you're tender
Believe me it won't end here I love you
With the desire for you and I'll still want you
And all that I could think about was you sure would look better
In that dress than she does
Baby in my eyes there's nothing in this world
That looks as good as you
Now does that sound like the voice of a man
Who's gonna get up from here and walk out of your life no way
You're one more sexy lady a true piece of heaven's art
You're one more sexy lady and I love you with all my heart
Sexy lady with all my heart
I like the sexy way you build a fire in the fireplace
Then lay me down and rub my back and build another fire in my soul
And I like the sexy way you pour the wine and light the candles
And kiss me and make me warm when I'm cold
I like the sexy way you take your gentle fingers and softly touch my body
And prick its sin like all the world stands still
And I like the sexy way I fall asleep in your arms
Sometimes I catch myself staring at you while you're lying fast asleep
I memorize the moment and lock it away
In my heart somewhere where it'll keep
Sometimes I still tremble when you brush against my skin
Where your hand reaches out to touch my face
I've never known anyone like you before
And I know I'll never see the likes of you again
No one in this world could ever take your place
And in case you don't know it this is a love song
And it comes from the heart of someone who loves you so
I don't always show it so this is a love song
You are loved I just wanted you to know
And in the quiet times when you talk to me
I hang on to every word that you say
You might not always see my love but it's always there
It's funny but I don't remember one thing you and I ever fought about
I know you used to look at me with the coldest eyes
And speak to me with the sharpest tongue
But even that's hazy now you know what I do remember
And make up the softness of your body
When you'd snuggle up close to me and say baby I'm sorry
Needing to hold you wishing I could
Listening to your laughter echo through my mind
Forgetting the bad times remembering the good
I thought I'd never forget how the door sounded
When you used to slam it and walk out but I have forgotten
And yet I can almost hum the tune it played
When you opened it and come back in
You've never been the kind of woman to do wrong
And you're still the lady that I always knew
But you look so sad and lonely
Just close your eyes and hold me ladies get lonesome too
I know you're a good woman and you try to be a good wife
But I also know that you've had to spend too much time alone
And all the life has held you is faded dreams and songs sung blue
You've still got your pride but baby pride can't hold you
Or keep you warm the way that I can do
Cause ladies get lonesome too
You've always been a lady but tonight just lay back and be my baby
I can't take any longer baby I mean I can't wait any longer
To hold you to feel you our lives have touched our minds have touched
Satisfy my hunger you're the only one who can
Where do I have to go what do I have to do
Who do I have to lie to so I can lie with you I can't wait any longer
Patience has never been one of my virtues baby when I want something I want it now
And I want you now I wanna kiss you now I wanna love you now
I can't wait any longer...
When we get home babe gonna light your fire
Gonna wrap my arms around you and hold you close to me
Oh babe I wanna taste your lips I wanna feel your fantasy
I don't know what I'd do babe without you I don't know where I'd be
You're not just another lover no you're everything to me
Every time I'm with you baby I can't believe it's true
You can see it in my eyes I can feel it in your touch
You don't have to say a thing just let me show how much
I love you I need you yeah I wanna kiss you all over and over again
I wanna kiss you all over till the night closes in till the night closes in
No one else could ever make me feel the way you do
Oh stay with me baby and hold me all night long
Show me show me everything you do
Cause baby no one does it quite like you
I love you I need you yeah I wanna kiss you all over and over again
I wanna kiss you all over till the night closes in till the night closes in
I've got a confession to make when I first decided to bring you here tonight
I was scared to death I started once to call it off
Run back to my little corner of the world
But then I remembered how soft your lips can be
How tantalizing your body can be
And how great it is to make love to a married lady
Tonight I fell in love with a married lady
And she made me feel all the good things I've missed lately
Tonight I fell in love with a married lady
My life's been pretty crazy lately
I discovered there's a difference between what matters
And what counts and what counts is being close to you and loving you
Well I don't know what makes you wanna go
Baby you won't let your feelings show
Now you're leaving me all alone
And I'll be just another broken heart when you're gone
Stay with me just a little bit longer lay with me till I'm a little stronger
I can't feel the night alone without love
Baby have a little mercy on me tell me girl you won't leave me lonely
Stay and let's talk awhile about love
All I want is one last night with you
Come the morning do what you wanna do
So it won't be all in vain
Thank you for the times that you've given me
The memories are all locked away in my mind
And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow
There's something I feel I must say out loud
You're once twice three times a lady
Yes you're once twice three times a lady and I love you
You've shared my dreams my joys my pains
And if I had it all to live over again
She was sitting on a stool at a little bar called Seldom Seen
We walked out into the cool evening breeze.
She slid across the seat and snuggled up close to my side
And I began to run my fingers through her hair.
It was soft and silky.
I opened the door to her room.
As her sensuous soul swept me into sublime serenity.
Her plane left just as the morning sun slowly began to streak the starry sky.
And I never saw Double S again
Right now she's soaring somewhere above the clouds.
And I'm walking home on one.
And I just realized I never did find out what Double S stood for.
Make mine night time honky tonk women and bright signs I gotta play
At the end of the day
Give me the lights of the city and the feel of a woman against me and I'm on my way
Places faces jokers they play like they're aces kings and queens in shadowy scenes
When the sun sinks low and the working people go home
And the night life part of the city starts to turn on yeah
Counting the neon blow no one's alone
So make mine night time...
Make mine night time...
It feels like the old me and you again it feels like the old me and you
And it feels like the old me and you
This is where it was before it got to where it is
And I like it better here than where it's been
Love the way it should be lust the way it could be
It's feeling like it felt it before the feeling went away
And let me feeling nothing down inside
And I'm living out the life that I started out to live
When you used to live with me before love dies
And it feels like the old me and you...
My favorite room is the bedroom my favorite time is night
But our love is more than a bedroom thing
You're a fantastic woman in the kitchen a dynamite lady in the den
You're a hell of a lover in the bedroom but our love is more than a bedroom thing
So much more more than a bedroom thing
Your kisses leading me back to the room where the waters of passion flow
Somehow in the midst of all the madness that surrounds us
Love's come along out of nowhere like magic and found us
You say you've never been so happy and you cried unashamed
Go on and cry baby cry till you're dry baby I'm used to the rain
For until you came along all that I'd ever known was cloudy skies
I'm used to the rain let it wash all the pain from your eyes and our lives
From now till the end of the world the sun's gonna shine
And the rainbow that follows the rain will be all yours and mine
You say it's because you love me you cried unashamed
Go on and cry baby cry till you're dry baby I'm used to the rain
I know it's late I know you're weary I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are both of us lonely longing for shelter from all that we see
Why should we worry no one will care girl look at the stars so far away
We've got tonight who needs tomorrow we've got tonight babe why don't you stay
Deep in my soul I've been so lonely all of my hopes fading away
I've longed for love like everyone else does I know I'll keep searching even after today
So there it is girl I've said it all now and here we are babe what can you say
We've got tonight who needs tomorrow we've got tonight babe why don't you stay
I know it's late I know you're weary I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are both of us lonely so lonely
We've got tonight who needs tomorrow let's make it last let's find the way
In a dusty old saloon out west in Abilene
Dreaming dreams at forty that he dreamed at seventeen
He sings and plays his guitar for all of you bucks tonight
As she sings so low for the congregation
Looking in Nashville mirrors you can close your eyes and dream who you are
Looking in Nashville mirrors it's easy to see the reflection of the star
Every song he's written it's gonna be a country hit
He hates to leave his family but his dream won't let him quit
In a honky tonk in Georgia she looks old at sixteen
Lord she hates the spotlights she don't even like the scene
Looking in Nashville mirrors...
Excepting his award on the Grammy show tonight
That cowboy's now an outlaw stoned out of his mind
He's found that a star only lights an empty space
And the mirrors that he dreamed in he can't find the nerve to face
Looking in Nashville mirrors...
I've seen the way you've looked at her ever since you've got to town
You've wondered if she's married and if she is does she fool around
Well look a little closer at the third finger on her left hand
Her wedding ring's a one man band
She don't make pretty music with anyone but me you understand understand
The only song that she knows how to sing is Stand By Your Man
Her wedding ring's a one man band
I bet she knows the words to every verse of I Walk The Line
Her wedding ring's a one man band...
She was pretty and she laughed a lot Lord knows these days I need some laughter
So I called her up and I took her out she never dreamed what I was after
I wanted her lips I wanted her bad I wanted her love to clear my head
I wanted her to make me forget you but instead she made me remember
She looked at me with the softest eyes and spoke to me in a gentle whisper
And her body felt like it was gonna melt when I held her close and kissed her
As she slowly drew up a pattern on my back with a soft side of her finger so tender
I felt it early in the morning I trembled through and through
And I felt it again in the evening soon as the sun went down
Take me back to the magic in which my soul believed
Where every smile was a rainbow and every kiss was a dream
We had it didn't we have it and it burned didn't it burn
Love me and I'll be your best friend and you won't have to be alone ever again
I'll sing with you in the sunshine I'll shelter you from the raindrops and the wind
Love me and I'll be your best friend
I wanna be your lover and and slowly spread your hair down on my pillow
I wanna hold you close to me and feel your gentle breathing on my skin
Look you in the eyes whisper baby that's the best it's ever been
Then I wanna lie with you and listen to the thoughts that you've been thinking
Found out where you coming from what it really is that makes you fly
I want you to know I'm someone you can go and rest your troubles
Whatever you can cross or a mountain you can climb up to the sky
I'm a son of the south
I've picked tomatoes off of the vine
Watermelon in the summertime
I'm a son of the south
I'm a son of a son of a son of the south
I knew Elvis and he knew me
I learned about Jesus at my mama's knee
Like every good son of the south
He loved the lord and he hated sin
He used to let me go to church with him
He was a son of the south
Up in the woods high on a hill
He took me there once and that was a thrill
He was a son of the south
Now I've got a little boy six years old
He knows and he didn't have to be told
He was born with a whole lot of soul
He's a son of the south
He's already picked cotton and a little guitar
Drank his milk from a mason jar
He knows good and well where his roots are
He's a son of the south
I was standing on the band stand acting like a big man
But feeling all alone. when I saw her walking in the door looking
Like nothing I'd seen before and I said to my guitar picker
She was a real live 20th century fox
And I've always been the kind of a man
Long black hair and tight blue jeans
Like a movie star this 20th century fox.
I flew across the dance floor pointed at the stage door
Biggest smile I had seen in a long long while and she
Said jolly well that might be fun.
Oh She was a real live 20th century fox
Easy to talk to and easy love and that's
Soft pink lips turned me hotter then hot
She was a real live 20th century fox
And I've always been the kind of a man
Long black hair and tight blue jeans
Like a movie star this 20th century fox.
Yeah she looked just like a movie star
Oh her charm was universal
Her beauty was paramount
He's got a funny red nose old baggy pants
When he staggers down the street it's a funny little dance
Children gather round when he falls down
Everybody laughs at wino the clown
His wife died he died inside
He lost all his will to live and he had no use for pride
And not even all his children's love could bring him back again
He just crawled into a bottle now he's waiting for the end
He's got a funny red nose old baggy pants
When he staggers down the street it's a funny little dance
Children gather round when he falls down
Everybody laughs at wino the clown
Yeah they all laugh when he comes down the street stumbling all alone
Specially at the way he smiles and holds his arm as if someone's holding on
They all think he's lost his mind talking to thin air
Oh but only me and my daddy know that mama's walking there
He's got a funny red nose old baggy pants
When he staggers down the street it's a funny little dance
Children gather round when he falls down
Everybody laughs at wino the clown
But I never laugh when daddy falls down
I remember waking in the morning
To the sound of the rooster's crow
And Arthur Godfrey on the radio
Me and Dad were just like strangers
We never did see eye to eye
We almost came to blows one morning
So I packed my bags and I said goodbye
When you leave that way you can never go back
A train won't run on a torn up track
Sometimes I wish I'd never roamed...
Then I met a girl in Knoxville
And we set our wedding day
I left her standing at the alter
With a baby on the way
When you leave that way you can never go back
A train won't run on a torn up track
Sometimes I wish I'd never roamed...
Lord I'd love to see my mom and daddy
What I'd give to hold that boy of mine
I'd get down on my knees and say I'm sorry
If I could only go back one more time
Oh but I killed a man in Houston
When he caught me with his wife
And I told the preacher man to go to hell
When he came to read my rights
A soul won't roll on a torn up track
All through eternity you'll roam alone
Oh when you leave that way you can never go back
A train won't run on a torn up track
She was on her way out of your life when I found her
Not knowing which way to turn
She's forgotten the feeling of two arms around her
But it didn't take her long to learn.
You had new worlds to conquer so you didn't want her
But don't she look great in the new dress I bought her
And don't she look good when she smiles.
Did you really think you were so all important
She couldn't get by on her own
Did you really think losing you would destroy her
She stuck to her promise and talked to her conscious
She did all she could for a while
Now don't she look good when she smiles.
Don't she look good in a new dress I bought her
And the new way that she wears her hair
She's in a new world and she's not the same girl
She knows now that somebody cares.
You can't believe that the same girl you let go
Could change so in this little while
But don't she look great in a new dress I bought her
And don't she look good when she smiles.
I've lost count of the hours
And I've lost track of the days
And that's one thing that no one can mar
I don't know who you're with
I don't even know where you've gone
My only hope is that some day you might hear this song
And you'll know that I wrote it especially for you
This flame in my heart is like an eternal fire
For every day it burns hotter
And every day it burns higher
And I haven't been able to put out one little flicker
Not even with all of these tears
My friends think I'm crazy and maybe I am
But I'll carry this torch just as long as I can
And I want you to know
She was sitting on a stool at a little bar called Seldom Seen
We walked out into the cool evening breeze.
She slid across the seat and snuggled up close to my side
And I began to run my fingers through her hair.
It was soft and silky.
I opened the door to her room.
As her sensuous soul swept me into sublime serenity.
Her plane left just as the morning sun slowly began to streak the starry sky.
And I never saw Double S again
Right now she's soaring somewhere above the clouds.
And I'm walking home on one.
And I just realized I never did find out what Double S stood for.
Got the alarm clock set for seven
Got the taxi called for nine
Plane takes off at eleven
And I gotta be there on time.
Told the boss I was going to my mother's
Told mama I was gonna see a friend
Out of town on a wild weekend.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little blond haired blue eyed darling
Gonna have a wild weekend.
We might go down to the sea
Somewhere off from the big wide world
Baby's gonna cook me breakfast
Baby's gonna tuck me in
With kisses on a wild weekend.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little blond haired blue eyed darling
Gonna have a wild weekend.
I guess we'll talk about the future
Mostly though we're just gonna sit by the fire
Least one time in his life
Just get away on a wild weekend
Like I'm gonna do with my wife.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little mother of my two children
I get to thinking lots of times about back when I was a lad
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
And come morning Rock of Ages would wake me gently once again
And when daddy would reach up and he'd take the Bible down
And he'd read it read it loud and long
And I always felt that maybe our house was blessed
When daddy would say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess and then Bob and then Tommy and then Dan
By then dad's hair was turning white and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that as daddy's back grew weak my mother's faith just grew strong
And those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
I guess the house is still standing I don't get to go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls and no steps to grace the floor
For you see my mother sings in heaven now around God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this world is a better place
Someone you've loved so much before
We ran out of anything to call it so we called it quits.
The longer you live with someone you can't live with
We called it magic then we called it tragic
Finally we called it quits.
It's always been harder to fall out of love than fall in
But I doubt if I'll ever forget where I've been
We couldn't call it happy though it was for a while
The longer you live with someone you can't live with
We called it lovely then we called it lonely
Finally we called it quits.
We called it magic then we called it tragic
I happened to walk into a honky tonk
One night down in New Orleans
Up above the bar hung a big guitar
Like none I'd ever seen.
The neck was set with diamonds
And though the strings were old
Like Kings of sound they wound around
Six keys of solid gold.
A man stepped up beside me
His breath was strong with wine
He said you know that guitar once belonged
To a mighty close pal of mine.
He used to play it right here
If you'd care to buy me a drink.
That takes a man a fool
And then he rocked back on his stool.
He just returned from the Great War
His buddies gave him that guitar
At the time it was simple and plain
He added the gold and the diamonds
As he played his way to fame.
He was doing a show in Shreveport
The night he received a call
The greatest show at all.
I was driving him to Nashville
It was cold and misting rain
The signals flashed and the whistle screamed
I swear Mister I never saw that train.
I heard the doctor tell him
Just after he used his knife
You're lucky son it was just your arm
It could have been your life.
More than he could give
He just lost his will to live.
But this world's loss is heaven's gain
And tonight he's still a star
He plays with a band of angels
On the banks of the river by the railroad track
We kept chickens in a pen in the back
My daddy was a farmer but all he ever raised was us
Salvation Army give us clothes to wear
A man from the county came to cut our hair
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
That was ten dollar less than the landlord wanted for rent
The landlord's letters got nasty indeed
He wrote get out but pa couldn't read
And we was too broke to even pay heed
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
But we had something in our house money can't buy
Kept us warm in the winter cool when the sun was high
For whenever we didn't have food enough
We patched the cracks and set the table with love
I came home last night to a dark and lonely cottage
I took the wreath off the door and somehow I stumbled inside
I just can't I just can't I said live without her
Give me one reason to live now that my darling has died.
And then five little fingers
Too young to understand.
And there was a softness in my little girl's touch
That seemed to say daddy I need you so
And in five little seconds her five little fingers
Told me all that I wanted to know.
I could tell her little eyes were full of questions
I tried to answer but all I could do was hold her tight
Forgive me forgive me I said for crying
But darling your daddy has got such a load on his shoulders tonight.
And then five little fingers
Touched me on the cheek
And gently brushed away a tear.
And I knew that in her own little way
My baby was saying daddy I love you so
It only took five little seconds for her five little fingers
To tell me all that I needed to know.
They're not teardrops
They're I love you drops
They were on my pillow when I woke up this morning
They were on the letter I tried all day to write
And just a little while ago I saw them
Falling on your picture as I kissed it goodnight.
You've been gone so long drops.
They're not teardrops
That say I'm lonesome
Never knew this heart could hurt the way it hurts for you
Never lived so many lifetimes in a week
Why don't you come back to me the way you said you would
And kiss these little crystals off my cheek.
You've been gone so long drops.
They're not teardrops
That say I'm lonesome
I've lost count of the hours
And I've lost track of the days
And that's one thing that no one can mar
I don't know who you're with
I don't even know where you've gone
My only hope is that some day you might hear this song
And you'll know that I wrote it especially for you
This flame in my heart is like an eternal fire
For every day it burns hotter
And every day it burns higher
And I haven't been able to put out one little flicker
Not even with all of these tears
My friends think I'm crazy and maybe I am
But I'll carry this torch just as long as I can

I guess the house is still standing I don't get to go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls and no steps to grace the floor
For you see my mother sings in heaven now around God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this world is a better place
A sense of freedom fills my veins I get the fever
Every time I sparrow flies up into the endless skies
Something down inside me cries I get the fever
I get the fever to pack up and leave here wander wild like the wind
Every time I hear a buddy say he's put lots of dust and clay
Between him and yesterday I get the fever
I get the fever to pack and leave here and I think maybe I'll do just that tomorrow
Everywhere I turn there's pain and sorrow
Every time I hear a buddy say he's put lots of dust and clay
Between him and yesterday I get the fever
You don't understand the pattern of my life
Because my life has got no pattern
You don't see and you can't feel the wind
That's blowing at my back and saying move boy
You think this burning fever in my heart is just a folly
I've tried my best to plant my feet and stay with you
But all I feel is roots grow
And what man wants a woman who won't satisfy his heart
I sleep all day and run all night
And you tell me that that ain't right
That ain't what the husbands of your friends do
You try to make me think my nonconforming life
Has colored me some evil shade
You delight and filling up my mind
Well I'm tired of feeling guilty and I'm tired of having nothing
I've tried my best to plant my feet and stay with you
But all I feel is roots grow
And what man wants a woman who won't satisfy his heart
I sleep all day and run all night
And you tell me that that ain't right
That ain't what the husbands of your friends do
The old hometown looks the same as I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
And I realize that I was only dreaming
There's a guard and there's a sad old padre arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
I dreamed about my mother dear old daddy sister and brother
And I dreamed about the sweetheart who's waited for so long.
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
By day I make the cars by night I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines.
You know I rode the freight train up north to Detroit City
I think I'm just gonna take my foolish pride
And put on a Southbound freight and ride.
Back to the loved ones who waited for so long
A long time ago when the earth was green
Why there was more kinda animals than you've ever seen
And loveliest of them all was the unicorn.
There was green alligators and long neck geese
Some cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born
The loveliest of all was the unicorn
He said hey brother Noah I'll tell you what to do
And take some green alligators and long neck geese
Some cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born
Don't you forget my unicorn.
He marched in the animals two by two
And he called out as they went through.
Some cats and rats and elephants
And then Noah looked out through the driving rain
Green alligators and long neck geese
The unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried
And that's why you've never seen a unicorn to this very day.
You'll see green alligators and long neck geese
Some cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born
I looked over my guitar and there stood an old man
His cowboy clothes were frayed and worn and his boots were far from new
He said I'd like to sit in with your band I'm a country singer too
Well we just had a big laugh
And when I looked back at the old man there was a tear in his eye
I told the band to cool it I didn't wanna see him cry
He reached down and he took my guitar with a determined look on his face
But as he started to play and sing a look of sadness took its place
He said I've sang my songs from Maine to California
Seen the world through the window of a car
I never saved a dime back when I made it I always thought someday I'd be a star
But now my voice is cracked and no one wants me my wife gave upon me years ago
I wonder if God likes country music will there be a place up there to sing my songs
Will he make my fingers nimble like they used to be
So I can play the chords and sing along
I just stood there none of us really knew what to say
He took my guitar and he put it down ever so gently
And then as he started to turn and leave
The band stood up and applauded and I can still hear his words today he said
I'm drinking from my saucer cause my cup has overflowed
You know I never did make my fortune and I guess it's a little late now
But I never did worry about that much
No shoot I was happy anyhow cause you see
As I have journeyed down life's road
I have reaped a lot more than I've sowed
And I'm drinking from my saucer cause my cup has over flowed
No I'm not a man of riches
But I got me a good family an old horse and a dog
They all love me well that makes me rich enough
I thank the Lord for all these bless the mercies he has bestowed
I'm drinking from my saucer cause my cup has overflowed
Oh I've had lots of times when it seemed everything went wrong
I could feel my faith get well just a little bit thin
But the rain would stop and dark clouds would roll away
The sun would come shining right back down in my life again
So Lord don't let me gripe too much about the rough row I've hoed
I'm drinking from my saucer my cup has overflowed
And now Lord if you can just give me the strength I need
And the courage when that old road gets steep and rough
And Lord don't ever let me get so busy that I can't help another with his load
And I just keep on drinking from my saucer cause my cup has surely overflowed
I'm drinking from my saucer cause my cup has overflowed
Two dollars who will make it three
Three dollars once three dollars twice going for three
And gently picked up the bow
He played a melody as pure and sweet as the caroling angel's sing
The music stopped and the auctioneer with a voice quiet and low said
Two thousand who will make it three
But the Master comes and a change is brought
My friend I said a prayer for you today and I know God must've heard
I felt the answer in my heart although He spoke no word
I didn't ask for wealth or fame I knew you wouldn't mind
I ask Him to send you treasure's of a far different kind
I asked that He watch over you at the start of each new day
And grant you health and peace and friend to share your way
I asked for happiness for you in all things great and small
You know friends are never earned
They are a gift from the loving God
They're precious beyond human evaluation
You dare not take them for granted
Or they'll drift away like smoke
And the warmth of there caring
Will vanish into the chill of the endless night.
Most of my friends are unknowns
They probably won't even rate an obituary
Unless they live and die in a small town
But some of my friends are big people
Their names are household words
And yet they are no more precious
In God's eyes or in mine.
Then those wonderful nobodies
Who live and die in obscurity
He's someone who warns you with a nod
Or with an unspoken word in hard times
When you are hurting beyond words
She's someone who holds you to her breast
And sighs softly into your hair.
When no other medicine
Could possibly stop the pain
A friend is someone who clinks
A glass against yours
At three in the morning when you're lost
And with a few words of encouragement
And concern makes you realize
Your not really lost at all.
Friends come in both sexes
In all shapes and sizes
The most important thing
They have in common is
Their ability to share with you
Your most sky splitting joys
I think of all the things I have in this world
He was just and old country doctor in a small Georgia town
Fame and fortune had passed him by but we never saw him frown
As day by day in his kindly way he served us one and all
Many a patient forgot to pay although Doc's fees were small
His only ambition it seemed was to find sure cures for aches and ills
Why nearly half the folks in our home town
And there were times he'd receive a fee
But he would pass it on to some poor soul that he said needed it worse than he
So when hard times hit our town and drained each meager purse
He had to sell his furniture why he couldn't even pay his office rent
On the hitching post at the curb below to advertise his wares
And there he kept on helping people get well and his heart was pure gold
But anyone with eyes could see that Doc was getting old
Then one day he didn't even answer when they knocked upon his door
They found him there in his old black suit but on his face was a smile of contentment
So they opened up his ledger and what they saw gave their hearts a pull
Well it looked like the potter's field for Doc and that caused us some alarm
It's a ghastly joke that our town was broke and no one could give a thing
Except Jones the undertaker he did mighty well
He donated an old iron casket he'd never been able to sell
And the funeral procession well it wasn't much for grace and pomp and style
And we breathed a prayer as we laid him there to rest beneath the sod
This man who had earned the right to be on speaking terms with God
His grave was covered with flowers but not from the floral shop
Just roses and things from folks gardens and one or two dandelion tops
For times had hit our town hard and each man carried a load
So some just picked the wild flowers as they passed along the way
We wanted to give Doc a monument we kind of figured we owed him one
But monuments cost money so we just did the best we could
And on his grave we just placed a monument of wood
We pulled up that old hitching post where Doc had nailed his sign
We painted it white and to all of us it surely did look fine
Now the rains and snow has washed away our white trimmings of paint
And there ain't nothing left but Doc's old sign and even that's getting faint
And still when southern breezes and twinkling stars cross our little town
You can still see that old hitching post as if in answer to our prayers
I dreamed I was there in Country Music Heaven
Last night I dreamed I went to Country Music Heaven
And you know who greeted me at the Gate
The Old Blue Yodeler himself Jimmy Rodgers
And right over there is some of your old commodores
Man was I glad to see them
I dreamed I was there in Country Music Heaven
He introduced me to Hank Williams and we saw Elvis
And then he showed me the Hall Of Fame
With all the gold guitars and fiddles hanging on the wall
And there they were standing side by side smiling at me
Dottie West and Keith Whitley
And then he said we got a big show up here tonight
And we have saved you a seat on the front row
Ah I sat and watched and listened
Like none I'd ever seen
Roger Miller opened the show with Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys
Jim Reeves and Patsy Cline
I saw all the stars in Country Music Heaven
Then I ask him who else he expected in the next say 100 years
Jimmy handed me a large book covered with stardust
He called it the big tally book
In it were many names
And each name was branded with pure gold
I began to read some of them as I turned the pages
I dreamed I was there in Country Music Heaven
Over all my burdens and through all my fears Jesus carries me
Through all my trials and through all my tears Jesus carries me
One night a man had a dream
And he dreamed he was walking with the Lord
A crossed the sky flashed scenes from his life
For each scene he noted two sets of footprints in the sand
One belonged to him the other to the Lord
When the last scene of his life flashed before him
He looked back at the footprints in the sand
And noticed that many times along the path of his life
There was only one set of footprints
He also noticed that this seemed to happen
At the very lowest and sadist times in his life
This really bothered him and he questioned the Lord about it
Lord you said that once I decided to follow you
You would walk with me all the way but I have noticed
That in the most troublesome times in my life
There are only one set of foot prints
I don't understand why when I needed you the most
And I would never leave you during your times of trial and suffering
When you see only one set of foot prints
It was then that I carried you
Over all my burdens and through all my fears Jesus carries me
Through all my trials and through all my fears Jesus carries me
Oh he carries me across the burning sand over water deep and wide
He gently takes me by the hand and carries me to the other side
Jesus Jesus Jesus sweetest name I know
He was born in an obscure village
The son of a simple peasant woman
He grew up in another small town
And worked with his father in a carpenter shop until He was thirty
And then for three years he was what we might call a traveling preacher
He never wrote a book He never held political office
The places He did go He usually walked
He never did any of the things that one normally associates with greatness
He had no credentials but himself
The tide of public opinion turned against Him
Some of His friends deserted Him one denied Him
One even betrayed Him and turned Him over to His enemies
He went through the mockery of a trial
He was nailed to a cross between two thieves
While He was dying His executioners for His only possession
His robe His purple robe
When He was dead he was taken from the cross
And laid in a borrowed grave
Provided for the compassion of friends
Almost twenty wide centuries have since come and gone
And today this man is the centerpiece of the human race
The leader in the column of mankind problems
I think I am well with in the mark
That all the armies that ever marched
All the navies that ever sailed the seven seas
All the legislative bodies that ever met
All the kings and rulers that have ever rained
And all put together have not affected the life of man here on this earth
As much as that one solitary life
Jesus Jesus Jesus Sweetest name I know
Rock of Ages clef for me let me hide myself in Thee
It was a stylish congregation you could see they had been around
And they had the biggest pipe organ of any church in town
And every Sunday he insisted on singing in the choir
His voice was cracked and broken age had touched his vocal chords
And nearly every Sunday he would get behind and miss the words
Brother Ire must quit his singing or the choir is going to resign
So the pastor appointed a committee I think it was three or four
They got in their big fine car drove up to Ire's door
They found the choirs great trouble sitting there in a big armed chair
To discuss a little mater that affects the congregation
Now it seems your voice is interfering with the choir
The old man raised his head a sign he did hear
And on his cheek the three men caught the glitter of a tear
His feeble hands pushed back the locks as white as silky snow
And he answered the committee in a voice both soft and low
In that far off heavenly temple where my Master I shall meet
I wonder if when I try to sing the songs of God up higher
A science filled the room the old man bowed his head
From far away his voice is sweet now and he sings his hearts desires
Where there are no committees and no fashionable choirs
I was resting one evening by the side of the road
When I saw an old farmer in a field he had just hoed
His face was brown and all wrinkled by the sun and the wind
And he was talking to the Lord
Just like he would be talking to a friend
Hadn't rained in so long the fields are mighty dusty
It's been so unbearable hot that the kids are even getting fussy
Now that grass down in the pasture it should be knee high
If we could just have a little shower Lord
It might keep the cow from going dry
Ah but listen to me talking Lord
You'd think I wasn't grateful
Well you'd probably think I was down right hateful
You'd think I forgot about that new calf that you sent
And the money that came in the mail that took care of the rent
Maw's cold is better and Johnny is home from the navy
Oh that good Sunday dinner of chicken and dumplings and gravy
And that new preacher you sent us he sure is a fine young man
Why he is just converting them sinners to beat the ban
Well I guess I'll mossy on home now Lord
I'll not take no more of your time
I guess there are plenty of folks there about waiting to ring your line
And don't you worry about us none Lord
Soft as the voice of an angel whispers our comforting way
You know all entertainers get mail from their fans
And sometimes folks even write to us for advice
From man that worked in a factory
The factory had been forced to close down
And sadly the young man had lost his job
He'd been out of work for about a year
When his wife gave up took their three kids and left him
He'd been looking for work all this time
And now he's facing the situation all alone
He says that sometimes the depression takes over
And he doesn't know how he'll find the strength to go on
Well I'm not a professional counselor and certainly not a philosopher
I am a country singer but I do know from experience
That sometimes there is only one thing that will keep your heart from breaking
And that's what I'd like to offer to this young man
Some words of wisdom from a great old hymn
They call me Whispering Bill
Well today what I want to whisper is hope
Whispering hope oh how welcome thy voice
I got another letter from a single mom
Telling me she and her two children are just barely getting by
The child support payments come late and sometimes they don't come at all
The cost of sending the kids to school is growing every day
She is working two jobs just to make ends meet
She says sometimes there is just no light at the end of the tunnel only darkness
And sometimes she feels like ending it all
I just hope she will remember these words
Wait till the darkness is over wait till the tempest is gone
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow after the shower is gone
No matter how dark and how turbulent things may seem
The darkness will turn to light and the storm will calm
I hope these folks are listening as I whisper these words of hope
Not just for them but for any one
Who finds himself in a seemingly hopeless situation
It may be the homeless the sick the broken family
The business man even the leaders of our country
Anybody can be overcome by sorrow and desperation
And while I am just one man with one voice
I can lift it up in a hopeful message
That wherever there is life there is hope
Whispering hope oh how welcome Thy voice
Soft as the voice of an angel whispers our comforting way
You know all entertainers get mail from their fans
And sometimes folks even write to us for advice
From man that worked in a factory
The factory had been forced to close down
And sadly the young man had lost his job

Once more to be with you dear just for tonight to hold you tight
Once more I'd give a fortune if I could see you once more
So I don't want it to keep us apart
If you'll just give me all of your heart
Once more to be with you dear...
I'll hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms
Like you'd never been held before
I'll think of you each day and I'll dream the night away
Until you are in my arms once more
The stars up in the sky know the reason why
I feel so blue when I'm away from you
I'll hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms
So darling please wait for me
The stars up in the sky know the reason why...
Your eyes tell me all the things I need to know
And they're telling me you no longer care
I know you'll never leave me so I say goodbye and go
And remember all the love we used to share
Your eyes tell me you don't love me anymore
They're begging me to set you free
Your eyes tell me you don't love me anymore
And your eyes don't lie to me
Your eyes tell me your need for me is gone
They're telling me the flame of love is dying
Now that it's all over there's no use in hanging on
But you don't know the hurt I feel inside
Your eyes tell me you don't love me anymore
They're begging me to set you free
Your eyes tell me you don't love me anymore
The old hometown looks the same as I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
And I realize that I was only dreaming
There's a guard and there's a sad old padre arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
I dreamed about my mother dear old daddy sister and brother
And I dreamed about the sweetheart who's waited for so long.
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
By day I make the cars by night I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines.
You know I rode the freight train up north to Detroit City
I think I'm just gonna take my foolish pride
And put on a Southbound freight and ride.
Back to the loved ones who waited for so long
I looked over my guitar and there stood an old man
His cowboy clothes were frayed and worn and his boots were far from new
He said I'd like to sit in with your band I'm a country singer too
Well we just had a big laugh
And when I looked back at the old man there was a tear in his eye
I told the band to cool it I didn't wanna see him cry
He reached down and he took my guitar with a determined look on his face
But as he started to play and sing a look of sadness took its place
He said I've sang my songs from Maine to California
Seen the world through the window of a car
I never saved a dime back when I made it I always thought someday I'd be a star
But now my voice is cracked and no one wants me my wife gave upon me years ago
I wonder if God likes country music will there be a place up there to sing my songs
Will he make my fingers nimble like they used to be
So I can play the chords and sing along
I just stood there none of us really knew what to say
He took my guitar and he put it down ever so gently
And then as he started to turn and leave
The band stood up and applauded and I can still hear his words today he said
Tonight I'm sad my heart is weary
I'm wondering if I'm wrong or right
To dream about you though you left me
I wonder where you are tonight
That old rain is cold and slowly falling
Upon my window pane tonight
And though your heart was even colder
I wonder where you are tonight
Then came the dawn the day you left me
I tried to smile with all my might
But you could see the pain within me
That lingers in my heart tonight
That was before I met you
And I never saw one that I've wanted for mine
That was before I met you
Well I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you
Well I wanted to ramble and always be free
That was before I met you
And I said that nobody could ever hold me
That was before I met you
Well I thought I was swinging...
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you
Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
I dreamed about my mother dear old daddy sister and brother
And I dreamed about the sweetheart who's waited for so long.

And then as he started to turn and leave
The band stood up and applauded and I can still hear his words today he said
I reached out my arms and I touched you with soft words I whispered your name
I held you right on the tip of my fingers but that was as close as I came
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands but I let it slip right through my hands
Somebody took you when I wasn't looking and I should have known from the start
It's a long long way from the tip of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart to the love hidden deep in your heart
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
On the banks of the river by the railroad track
We kept chickens in a pen in the back
My daddy was a farmer but all he ever raised was us
Salvation Army give us clothes to wear
A man from the county came to cut our hair
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
That was ten dollar less than the landlord wanted for rent
The landlord's letters got nasty indeed
He wrote get out but pa couldn't read
And we was too broke to even pay heed
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
But we had something in our house money can't buy
Kept us warm in the winter cool when the sun was high
For whenever we didn't have food enough
We patched the cracks and set the table with love
I get to thinking lots of times about back when I was a lad
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
And come morning Rock of Ages would wake me gently once again
And when daddy would reach up and he'd take the Bible down
And he'd read it read it loud and long
And I always felt that maybe our house was blessed
When daddy would say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess and then Bob and then Tommy and then Dan
By then dad's hair was turning white and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that as daddy's back grew weak my mother's faith just grew strong
And those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
I guess the house is still standing I don't get to go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls and no steps to grace the floor
For you see my mother sings in heaven now around God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this world is a better place
I've lost count of the hours
And I've lost track of the days
And that's one thing that no one can mar
I don't know who you're with
I don't even know where you've gone
My only hope is that some day you might hear this song
And you'll know that I wrote it especially for you
This flame in my heart is like an eternal fire
For every day it burns hotter
And every day it burns higher
And I haven't been able to put out one little flicker
Not even with all of these tears
My friends think I'm crazy and maybe I am
But I'll carry this torch just as long as I can
And I want you to know
All that's left of all our love now
My lonely world is only eight by ten eight by ten eight by ten
I remember the night that you gave me that picture I ought to
I've relived it so many times I remember how I couldn't wait to get home
Put it in a frame and tell everybody that you were mine.
Because you were mine at least until someone else came along
And took you off out of my sight
It's a good thing that you did leave me your picture to hold
Because now I can cry on your shoulder every night.
My lonely world is only eight by ten.
It's awful to be jealous of an old picture frame
But I'm jealous of anything that's close to you
And that picture frame seems to be holding you pretty tight
That looks like more than I'll ever do.
I wish that I could just be the glass in that frame
And be so close to the lips that I love
I am glad that I've at least got your picture to hold
But sometimes it's just not enough
I came home last night to a dark and lonely cottage
I took the wreath off the door and somehow I stumbled inside
I just can't I just can't I said live without her
Give me one reason to live now that my darling has died.
And then five little fingers
Too young to understand.
And there was a softness in my little girl's touch
That seemed to say daddy I need you so
And in five little seconds her five little fingers
Told me all that I wanted to know.
I could tell her little eyes were full of questions
I tried to answer but all I could do was hold her tight
Forgive me forgive me I said for crying
But darling your daddy has got such a load on his shoulders tonight.
And then five little fingers
Touched me on the cheek
And gently brushed away a tear.
And I knew that in her own little way
My baby was saying daddy I love you so
It only took five little seconds for her five little fingers
To tell me all that I needed to know.
And you're saying what a crazy fool I am
But the one I love is out tonight with him
I need a drink but all the bars are locked up tight
A lonely man gets mighty thirsty late at night
There's the river here's the bridge it's too late now
I've got nothing left to live for anyhow
In the news they'll say he couldn't even swim
I love those bright lights and country music
I won't stay home and cry tonight like all the nights before
I've just learned that I don't really need you anymore
I found a little place downtown where guys like me can go
And they've got bright lights and country music
Bright lights and country music a bottle and a glass
Soon I'll be forgetting that there ever was a past
And when everybody asks me what helped me forget so fast
I'll say bright lights and country music
A table by the bandstand a bottle filled with wine
Honky tonks were made for men with women on their minds
Nothing else can take away this loneliness of mine
Quite like bright lights and country music
Bright lights and country music...
I happened to walk into a honky tonk
One night down in New Orleans
Up above the bar hung a big guitar
Like none I'd ever seen.
The neck was set with diamonds
And though the strings were old
Like Kings of sound they wound around
Six keys of solid gold.
A man stepped up beside me
His breath was strong with wine
He said you know that guitar once belonged
To a mighty close pal of mine.
He used to play it right here
If you'd care to buy me a drink.
That takes a man a fool
And then he rocked back on his stool.
He just returned from the Great War
His buddies gave him that guitar
At the time it was simple and plain
He added the gold and the diamonds
As he played his way to fame.
He was doing a show in Shreveport
The night he received a call
The greatest show at all.
I was driving him to Nashville
It was cold and misting rain
The signals flashed and the whistle screamed
I swear Mister I never saw that train.
I heard the doctor tell him
Just after he used his knife
You're lucky son it was just your arm
It could have been your life.
More than he could give
He just lost his will to live.
But this world's loss is heaven's gain
And tonight he's still a star
He plays with a band of angels
They're not teardrops
They're I love you drops
They were on my pillow when I woke up this morning
They were on the letter I tried all day to write
And just a little while ago I saw them
Falling on your picture as I kissed it goodnight.
You've been gone so long drops.
They're not teardrops
That say I'm lonesome
Never knew this heart could hurt the way it hurts for you
Never lived so many lifetimes in a week
Why don't you come back to me the way you said you would
And kiss these little crystals off my cheek.
You've been gone so long drops.
They're not teardrops
That say I'm lonesome
A sense of freedom fills my veins I get the fever
Every time I sparrow flies up into the endless skies
Something down inside me cries I get the fever
I get the fever to pack up and leave here wander wild like the wind
Every time I hear a buddy say he's put lots of dust and clay
Between him and yesterday I get the fever
I get the fever to pack and leave here and I think maybe I'll do just that tomorrow
Everywhere I turn there's pain and sorrow
Every time I hear a buddy say he's put lots of dust and clay
Between him and yesterday I get the fever
Got the alarm clock set for seven
Got the taxi called for nine
Plane takes off at eleven
And I gotta be there on time.
Told the boss I was going to my mother's
Told mama I was gonna see a friend
Out of town on a wild weekend.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little blond haired blue eyed darling
Gonna have a wild weekend.
We might go down to the sea
Somewhere off from the big wide world
Baby's gonna cook me breakfast
Baby's gonna tuck me in
With kisses on a wild weekend.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little blond haired blue eyed darling
Gonna have a wild weekend.
I guess we'll talk about the future
Mostly though we're just gonna sit by the fire
Least one time in his life
Just get away on a wild weekend
Like I'm gonna do with my wife.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little mother of my two children
You don't understand the pattern of my life
Because my life has got no pattern
You don't see and you can't feel the wind
That's blowing at my back and saying move boy
You think this burning fever in my heart is just a folly
I've tried my best to plant my feet and stay with you
But all I feel is roots grow
And what man wants a woman who won't satisfy his heart
I sleep all day and run all night
And you tell me that that ain't right
That ain't what the husbands of your friends do
You try to make me think my nonconforming life
Has colored me some evil shade
You delight and filling up my mind
Well I'm tired of feeling guilty and I'm tired of having nothing
I've tried my best to plant my feet and stay with you
But all I feel is roots grow
And what man wants a woman who won't satisfy his heart
I sleep all day and run all night
And you tell me that that ain't right
That ain't what the husbands of your friends do
Now the morning sun streaks across my room
And I'm wakened up from another dream of you
All I've left behind is a chain of broken dreams.
How I wish this love was all we'd need to live
And it seems so wrong deep inside my heart
That the dollar sign should be keeping us apart.
If only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life had not yet crossed our minds
For the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you.
But you know we can't live on dreams alone
Got to pay the rent got to leave you all alone
But you know I made my choice many years ago
Now this traveling life is the only life I know.
I'm not looking for a sweetheart just a gentle lady friend
Someone I can softly turn to when I need to now and then
I reach over in the corner of my life and I find you waiting there
You're a number I can phone you're a letter I can write
You're my water when I'm thirsty in the middle of the night
You're a warm and tender body you're a woman not a wife
And just knowing you has brightened the corner of my life
There's a special kind of feeling when we're simply touching hands
There's a special kind of comfort knowing someone understands
I'm no knight in shining armor I'll never carry you away
But you're filling up the corner of my life in the nicest kind of way
You're a number I can phone...
On the poor side of Fort Worth in a rundown motel
A rodeo cowboy held a young Texas belle
He scooped up some peanuts right out of the can
And he whispered as he placed them in the palm of her hand
Baby I wish they were diamonds and this was north Dallas
And I wish oh I wish you were mine oh I wish Lord I wish you were mine
On the north side of Dallas in a forty roomed house
She remembers her cowboy as she takes off her blouse
She fingers the diamonds that cling to her breast
Her teardrops fall freely as she looks to the west
And I wish oh I wish he was mine oh she cries Lord I wish he was mine
Cowboys and rich girls just don't live in the same world
I can't take any longer baby I mean I can't wait any longer
To hold you to feel you our lives have touched our minds have touched
Satisfy my hunger you're the only one who can
Where do I have to go what do I have to do
Who do I have to lie to so I can lie with you I can't wait any longer
Patience has never been one of my virtues baby when I want something I want it now
And I want you now I wanna kiss you now I wanna love you now
I can't wait any longer...
She was sitting on a stool at a little bar called Seldom Seen
We walked out into the cool evening breeze.
She slid across the seat and snuggled up close to my side
And I began to run my fingers through her hair.
It was soft and silky.
I opened the door to her room.
As her sensuous soul swept me into sublime serenity.
Her plane left just as the morning sun slowly began to streak the starry sky.
And I never saw Double S again
Right now she's soaring somewhere above the clouds.
And I'm walking home on one.
And I just realized I never did find out what Double S stood for.
I get to thinking lots of times about back when I was a lad
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
And come morning Rock of Ages would wake me gently once again
And when daddy would reach up and he'd take the Bible down
And he'd read it read it loud and long
And I always felt that maybe our house was blessed
When daddy would say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess and then Bob and then Tommy and then Dan
By then dad's hair was turning white and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that as daddy's back grew weak my mother's faith just grew strong
And those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
I guess the house is still standing I don't get to go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls and no steps to grace the floor
For you see my mother sings in heaven now around God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this world is a better place
I've lost count of the hours
And I've lost track of the days
And that's one thing that no one can mar
I don't know who you're with
I don't even know where you've gone
My only hope is that some day you might hear this song
And you'll know that I wrote it especially for you
This flame in my heart is like an eternal fire
For every day it burns hotter
And every day it burns higher
And I haven't been able to put out one little flicker
Not even with all of these tears
My friends think I'm crazy and maybe I am
But I'll carry this torch just as long as I can
And I want you to know
I'm not looking for a sweetheart just a gentle lady friend
Someone I can softly turn to when I need to now and then
I reach over in the corner of my life and I find you waiting there
You're a number I can phone you're a letter I can write
You're my water when I'm thirsty in the middle of the night
You're a warm and tender body you're a woman not a wife
And just knowing you has brightened the corner of my life
There's a special kind of feeling when we're simply touching hands
There's a special kind of comfort knowing someone understands
I'm no knight in shining armor I'll never carry you away
But you're filling up the corner of my life in the nicest kind of way
You're a number I can phone...
On the banks of the river by the railroad track
We kept chickens in a pen in the back
My daddy was a farmer but all he ever raised was us
Salvation Army give us clothes to wear
A man from the county came to cut our hair
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
That was ten dollar less than the landlord wanted for rent
The landlord's letters got nasty indeed
He wrote get out but pa couldn't read
And we was too broke to even pay heed
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
But we had something in our house money can't buy
Kept us warm in the winter cool when the sun was high
For whenever we didn't have food enough
We patched the cracks and set the table with love
A sense of freedom fills my veins I get the fever
Every time I sparrow flies up into the endless skies
Something down inside me cries I get the fever
I get the fever to pack up and leave here wander wild like the wind
Every time I hear a buddy say he's put lots of dust and clay
Between him and yesterday I get the fever
I get the fever to pack and leave here and I think maybe I'll do just that tomorrow
Everywhere I turn there's pain and sorrow
Every time I hear a buddy say he's put lots of dust and clay
Between him and yesterday I get the fever
I reached out my arms and I touched you with soft words I whispered your name
I held you right on the tip of my fingers but that was as close as I came
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands but I let it slip right through my hands
Somebody took you when I wasn't looking and I should have known from the start
It's a long long way from the tip of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart to the love hidden deep in your heart
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
And you're saying what a crazy fool I am
But the one I love is out tonight with him
I need a drink but all the bars are locked up tight
A lonely man gets mighty thirsty late at night
There's the river here's the bridge it's too late now
I've got nothing left to live for anyhow
In the news they'll say he couldn't even swim
They're not teardrops
They're I love you drops
They were on my pillow when I woke up this morning
They were on the letter I tried all day to write
And just a little while ago I saw them
Falling on your picture as I kissed it goodnight.
You've been gone so long drops.
They're not teardrops
That say I'm lonesome
Never knew this heart could hurt the way it hurts for you
Never lived so many lifetimes in a week
Why don't you come back to me the way you said you would
And kiss these little crystals off my cheek.
You've been gone so long drops.
They're not teardrops
That say I'm lonesome
Got the alarm clock set for seven
Got the taxi called for nine
Plane takes off at eleven
And I gotta be there on time.
Told the boss I was going to my mother's
Told mama I was gonna see a friend
Out of town on a wild weekend.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little blond haired blue eyed darling
Gonna have a wild weekend.
We might go down to the sea
Somewhere off from the big wide world
Baby's gonna cook me breakfast
Baby's gonna tuck me in
With kisses on a wild weekend.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little blond haired blue eyed darling
Gonna have a wild weekend.
I guess we'll talk about the future
Mostly though we're just gonna sit by the fire
Least one time in his life
Just get away on a wild weekend
Like I'm gonna do with my wife.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little mother of my two children
I love those bright lights and country music
I won't stay home and cry tonight like all the nights before
I've just learned that I don't really need you anymore
I found a little place downtown where guys like me can go
And they've got bright lights and country music
Bright lights and country music a bottle and a glass
Soon I'll be forgetting that there ever was a past
And when everybody asks me what helped me forget so fast
I'll say bright lights and country music
A table by the bandstand a bottle filled with wine
Honky tonks were made for men with women on their minds
Nothing else can take away this loneliness of mine
Quite like bright lights and country music
Bright lights and country music...
I'd rather live a life of lies and fantasy
Than face the truth and realize you're leaving me
You built me up so high my heart can't stand the fall
And life without you love just isn't life at all.
So walk out backwards if you must go
And please don't wave goodbye
Just wave one last hello
The truth won't hurt so much
If I can't just pretend
So walk out backwards and
I'll think you're walking in.
You walked into my heart in search of sympathy
From that day down to this you've walked all over me
And now you're walking out to love somebody new
But you're not by yourself cause my heart's leaving too.
So walk out backwards if you must go
And please don't wave goodbye
Just wave one last hello
The truth won't hurt so much
If I can't just pretend
So walk out backwards and
All the things come to an end
Yes that means we'll never love again
The end of our love the end of my dreams
The end of almost everything it seems
Except these heartaches these teardrops
And this loneliness goes on and on and on
On and on and on as if there were no tomorrow
As if the night had come to stay and there would be no dawn
Love has stopped time has stopped
Everything on this earth has stopped
Except these heartaches these teardrops
And this loneliness goes on and on and on
For loving you my life is so much richer
You've given so much to live for
And for loving you my faith is a little stronger
For a world that could give you to me
Couldn't be as bad as it's made out to be
And for needing you I feel a whole lot stronger
For there's a strength that comes
From knowing you need to give up yourself
And now I'm losing you and I'm a sadder lonelier man
Than I ever thought any man could be
The hunting trail of memory.
Even for all the pain that I'm feeling right now
Never once will I ever regret
Having had the chance of loving you.
Maybe I don't love you quite as much as I believe I love you baby
Maybe I don't need you quite as much as I profess to need you baby
And who's to say anyway that love is not a game we play
As long as I feel warm inside wanted filled and satisfied
Maybe I just gotta have somebody and you're close and you're somebody
But don't leave me you've put me in a happy state of mind
And who's to say anyway...
Someone you've loved so much before
We ran out of anything to call it so we called it quits.
The longer you live with someone you can't live with
We called it magic then we called it tragic
Finally we called it quits.
It's always been harder to fall out of love than fall in
But I doubt if I'll ever forget where I've been
We couldn't call it happy though it was for a while
The longer you live with someone you can't live with
We called it lovely then we called it lonely
Finally we called it quits.
We called it magic then we called it tragic
You like your new dress for a while
Then you say it went out of style
And you liked your new car for a mouth or so
The next day you dig baseball games
The way that you keep changing things
She was on her way out of your life when I found her
Not knowing which way to turn
She's forgotten the feeling of two arms around her
But it didn't take her long to learn.
You had new worlds to conquer so you didn't want her
But don't she look great in the new dress I bought her
And don't she look good when she smiles.
Did you really think you were so all important
She couldn't get by on her own
Did you really think losing you would destroy her
She stuck to her promise and talked to her conscious
She did all she could for a while
Now don't she look good when she smiles.
Don't she look good in a new dress I bought her
And the new way that she wears her hair
She's in a new world and she's not the same girl
She knows now that somebody cares.
You can't believe that the same girl you let go
Could change so in this little while
But don't she look great in a new dress I bought her
And don't she look good when she smiles.
You don't wanna hurt me but you've just gotta have him
Can you really take your rings off without feeling kinda dirty
Can you really kiss him while you're wearing my name
Can you run your fingers all across his body
I make believe I make believe that you're here with me yes I do
I make believe I make believe that you'll always be my very own yes I do
I guess I'm all wrapped up in a world of make believe
I make believe I make believe every time the phone rings that it's you yes I do
I make believe every time that there's a knock on the door
I make believe it's you yes I do baby
I guess I'm all wrapped up in a world of make believe
And yet faith can move mountains and behind even the darkest cloud the sun can shine
Then I'll be there with you and all of our dreams will come true
About a woman who wakes him up every morning and loves him
Scrambles his eggs and unscrambles his life butters his toast with a golden knife
Bears his kids and nearly bout all of his burdens
I've been out half of the night and I'm hung over
No one to love and make me happy call me baby or call me pappy
About the woman who serves him love on a silver platter
I look in the mirror and I wonder what's the matter
I've got to sign on the radio station I'm what's known as a country DJ
Ain't exactly what you call a gourmet breakfast but rich boys don't play country DJ
Earphones microphones telephones backbones just about to break now any day
Lord have mercy on a country DJ
News machine must've run out of paper last thing I have is the midnight report
Earphones microphones...
Turntable's ready got my records at hand
Howdy there friends out in the radio land
Earphones microphones...
Are you sure that Ralph Emery and Charlie Douglas got started this way
I tell you I have to do everything around here
Sign on sign off pick up records pick up trash cut commercials
Cut the grass carry out orders carry out garbage answer to the boss
I tell you what I'm gonna get a real job
But sometimes I feel like I've just got to get away
From the same old existence day after day
Sometimes I long for a warm tender kiss
Just to see if there's anything I might have missed
And it's beginning to feel like this might be one of those sometimes
Those one times in a lifetime
I'm aching to hold you kiss and console you drive you right out of your mind
But I know when I do I won't get over you for quite sometimes
That's what made me love you that's what made me love you
There ain't no way that time can make a bad thing out of our love
In a hundred years I'll think back and I'll have the memory of
That's what made me love you that's what made me love you
Liars one believers zero
Liars two believers zero
I see the look in her eyes and I know that she believes
Before the night is over she'll give herself to me
I'll hold her close and I'll kiss her lips tell her I love her so
Liars three believers zero
Hey honey I'm home I had to work all night with the job like mine that's how it goes
Liars four believers zero
But wait she's not here she's gone with all her things
She found she couldn't beat me so she started her own game
I've checked the house and I've called her friends where she's gone nobody knows
We've been together since way back when sometimes I never want to see you again
But I want you to know after all these years
You're still the one I want whispering in my ear
You're still the one I wanna talk to in bed still the one that turns my head
I looked at your face every day but I never saw it till I went away
Then winter came I just wanted to go deep in the desert I longed for the snow
You're still the one that makes me laugh still the one that's my better half
You're still the one that makes me strong still the one I wanna take along
Still the one I love to touch still the one and I can't get enough
You're still the one that can scratch my itch you're still the one and I wouldn't switch
You are still the one who makes me shout still the one that I dream about
He looks in the mirror and spots a new wrinkle
The gray in his hair sadly tells him the truth Time's marching on to its own heartless drummer It'll never return to the days of his youth He listens to Garth and he listens to Reba
He loves country music but he says point blank They don't make the songs now as good as they used to And he misses Ernest and Lefty and Hank
He's a child of the fifties confused by the nineties bytes and web sites and violence and crime And he says only two things get better with time A good love and a bottle of wine
A good love and a bottle of wine
She wakes him up gently and whispers good morning She brings him his coffee one sugar no cream
He couldn't tell you how long they've been married But she's still his angel and the girl of his dreams And tonight when they lie in that big bed together He'll tell her he loves her he'll hold her and then They'll talk about life and the roads that they've traveled And he'll say I'd sure like to do it again He saw the bridges of Madison county
Apollo 13 sent a chill up his spine
But he still says just two things get better with time A good love and a bottle of wine
A good love and a bottle of wine
Contentment's a journey it's no destination
You live long enough and one day you'll find
That there's only two things get better with time A good love and a bottle of wine
I reached out my arms and I touched you with soft words I whispered your name
I held you right on the tip of my fingers but that was as close as I came
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands but I let it slip right through my hands
Somebody took you when I wasn't looking and I should have known from the start
It's a long long way from the tip of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart to the love hidden deep in your heart
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
I thought if you weren't busy we might have lunch tomorrow
And talk about a few things laying heavy on my mind
Where we used to go back in the better times when you are mine
And I think it's time I made a few amends
I'd like to look you in the eyes and tell you I apologize
Besides I want us to be friends
It's too late to work things out for me and you
But there's still somethings I feel I've got to do
I could make up a lot of excuses for the way that I acted
But the bottom line is I was simply a fool
And there is no excuse for the truth
But I just wanna make sure that
Before any more water runs under the bridge
And anymore time passes us by that you understand
How much I regret everything that happened
That I still love you and I will till the day that I die
It's too late to work things out for me and you
But there's still somethings I feel I've got to do
I've got way too much time on my hands
I stayed up all night wondering if the
Eagles or the Beatles were the world's best band
Since you've been gone I sit by the phone
I've got way too much time on my hands
I go out twice a day and rotate my tires
I've read every word in the last six issues of the national enquirer
Every other day I put another shade of paint on the kitchen walls
I've got way too much time on my hands
If Budweiser or Miller is my favorite brand
I started writing these songs since you've been gone
I've got way too much time on my hands
I know it's only temporary
The things I think and the way I act
I've got way too much time on my hands
I stayed up all night wondering if the
Eagles or the Beatles were the world's best band
Since you've been gone I sit by the phone
I've got way too much time on my hands
I asked the man who drove the bus
To let me off at Maple Avenue
He looked at me through puzzled eyes
I got off the bus and asked a man
My old hometown sure has changed in twenty years
Still lives anywhere close to here
This is where I always thought we'd build our dream house
But that dream disappeared
And that's the biggest reason I've only come back once in twenty years
I remember it just like yesterday
The Friday night we held our senior prom
I'd walked outside to get some air
And found her there in Billy Taylor's arms
The kids all laughed at me and said
They known about it since our junior year
I got so mad and hurt so bad
I hit the road and stayed for twenty years
It still hurts today the same way it's hurt for twenty years
All the heartaches linger and they still point their finger at me
But I guess I'm still wet behind the years
I think I'll head home down the road
Maybe try again in twenty years
At the end of a cold and lonely rainy night
But you believed in me and gave me strength
To try again and get it right
Now it feels so good to feel so good about love
It feels so good to feel so good about us
And it feels so good to feel so good about love
In my wildest dreams not once did I imagine
I'd ever find myself in the arms of a woman like you
But you believed in me and made me see that I could believe in me too
Now it feels so good to feel so good about love
It feels so good to feel so good about us
And it feels so good to feel so good about love
In the middle of the night
His grandson got up out of bed
And lit the coal oil light
He sat there and held his hand
Till his grandpa felt alright
And then he tucked him back in bed
And kissed his wrinkled brow goodnight
Every once in a while
When someone goes the extra mile
A father told his eight year old
I've got to fly to Houston
The boss says there's a deal that just can't wait
The young boy tried to hide his tears
But his dad could feel his pain
And he knew he'd have to tell the boss
Every once in a while
When someone goes the extra mile
A young girl told her mother
I can't raise this child alone
He said he would marry me
But this note says he's gone
Her mother pulled her close and said
But as long as there's a breath of life in me
Every once in a while
When someone goes the extra mile
A sense of freedom fills my veins I get the fever
Every time I sparrow flies up into the endless skies
Something down inside me cries I get the fever
I get the fever to pack up and leave here wander wild like the wind
Every time I hear a buddy say he's put lots of dust and clay
Between him and yesterday I get the fever
I get the fever to pack and leave here and I think maybe I'll do just that tomorrow
Everywhere I turn there's pain and sorrow
Every time I hear a buddy say he's put lots of dust and clay
Between him and yesterday I get the fever
I've lost count of the hours
And I've lost track of the days
And that's one thing that no one can mar
I don't know who you're with
I don't even know where you've gone
My only hope is that some day you might hear this song
And you'll know that I wrote it especially for you
This flame in my heart is like an eternal fire
For every day it burns hotter
And every day it burns higher
And I haven't been able to put out one little flicker
Not even with all of these tears
My friends think I'm crazy and maybe I am
But I'll carry this torch just as long as I can
And I want you to know
I'm not looking for a sweetheart just a gentle lady friend
Someone I can softly turn to when I need to now and then
I reach over in the corner of my life and I find you waiting there
You're a number I can phone you're a letter I can write
You're my water when I'm thirsty in the middle of the night
You're a warm and tender body you're a woman not a wife
And just knowing you has brightened the corner of my life
There's a special kind of feeling when we're simply touching hands
There's a special kind of comfort knowing someone understands
I'm no knight in shining armor I'll never carry you away
But you're filling up the corner of my life in the nicest kind of way
You're a number I can phone...
I came home last night to a dark and lonely cottage
I took the wreath off the door and somehow I stumbled inside
I just can't I just can't I said live without her
Give me one reason to live now that my darling has died.
And then five little fingers
Too young to understand.
And there was a softness in my little girl's touch
That seemed to say daddy I need you so
And in five little seconds her five little fingers
Told me all that I wanted to know.
I could tell her little eyes were full of questions
I tried to answer but all I could do was hold her tight
Forgive me forgive me I said for crying
But darling your daddy has got such a load on his shoulders tonight.
And then five little fingers
Touched me on the cheek
And gently brushed away a tear.
And I knew that in her own little way
My baby was saying daddy I love you so
It only took five little seconds for her five little fingers
To tell me all that I needed to know.
For loving you my life is so much richer
You've given so much to live for
And for loving you my faith is a little stronger
For a world that could give you to me
Couldn't be as bad as it's made out to be
And for needing you I feel a whole lot stronger
For there's a strength that comes
From knowing you need to give up yourself
And now I'm losing you and I'm a sadder lonelier man
Than I ever thought any man could be
The hunting trail of memory.
Even for all the pain that I'm feeling right now
Never once will I ever regret
Having had the chance of loving you.
You don't wanna hurt me but you've just gotta have him
Can you really take your rings off without feeling kinda dirty
Can you really kiss him while you're wearing my name
Can you run your fingers all across his body
She was sitting on a stool at a little bar called Seldom Seen
We walked out into the cool evening breeze.
She slid across the seat and snuggled up close to my side
And I began to run my fingers through her hair.
It was soft and silky.
I opened the door to her room.
As her sensuous soul swept me into sublime serenity.
Her plane left just as the morning sun slowly began to streak the starry sky.
And I never saw Double S again
Right now she's soaring somewhere above the clouds.
And I'm walking home on one.
And I just realized I never did find out what Double S stood for.
Liars one believers zero
Liars two believers zero
I see the look in her eyes and I know that she believes
Before the night is over she'll give herself to me
I'll hold her close and I'll kiss her lips tell her I love her so
Liars three believers zero
Hey honey I'm home I had to work all night with the job like mine that's how it goes
Liars four believers zero
But wait she's not here she's gone with all her things
She found she couldn't beat me so she started her own game
I've checked the house and I've called her friends where she's gone nobody knows
I get to thinking lots of times about back when I was a lad
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
And come morning Rock of Ages would wake me gently once again
And when daddy would reach up and he'd take the Bible down
And he'd read it read it loud and long
And I always felt that maybe our house was blessed
When daddy would say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess and then Bob and then Tommy and then Dan
By then dad's hair was turning white and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that as daddy's back grew weak my mother's faith just grew strong
And those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
I guess the house is still standing I don't get to go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls and no steps to grace the floor
For you see my mother sings in heaven now around God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this world is a better place
But sometimes I feel like I've just got to get away
From the same old existence day after day
Sometimes I long for a warm tender kiss
Just to see if there's anything I might have missed
And it's beginning to feel like this might be one of those sometimes
Those one times in a lifetime
I'm aching to hold you kiss and console you drive you right out of your mind
But I know when I do I won't get over you for quite sometimes
You don't understand the pattern of my life
Because my life has got no pattern
You don't see and you can't feel the wind
That's blowing at my back and saying move boy
You think this burning fever in my heart is just a folly
I've tried my best to plant my feet and stay with you
But all I feel is roots grow
And what man wants a woman who won't satisfy his heart
I sleep all day and run all night
And you tell me that that ain't right
That ain't what the husbands of your friends do
You try to make me think my nonconforming life
Has colored me some evil shade
You delight and filling up my mind
Well I'm tired of feeling guilty and I'm tired of having nothing
I've tried my best to plant my feet and stay with you
But all I feel is roots grow
And what man wants a woman who won't satisfy his heart
I sleep all day and run all night
And you tell me that that ain't right
That ain't what the husbands of your friends do
All that's left of all our love now
My lonely world is only eight by ten eight by ten eight by ten
I remember the night that you gave me that picture I ought to
I've relived it so many times I remember how I couldn't wait to get home
Put it in a frame and tell everybody that you were mine.
Because you were mine at least until someone else came along
And took you off out of my sight
It's a good thing that you did leave me your picture to hold
Because now I can cry on your shoulder every night.
My lonely world is only eight by ten.
It's awful to be jealous of an old picture frame
But I'm jealous of anything that's close to you
And that picture frame seems to be holding you pretty tight
That looks like more than I'll ever do.
I wish that I could just be the glass in that frame
And be so close to the lips that I love
I am glad that I've at least got your picture to hold
But sometimes it's just not enough
She was on her way out of your life when I found her
Not knowing which way to turn
She's forgotten the feeling of two arms around her
But it didn't take her long to learn.
You had new worlds to conquer so you didn't want her
But don't she look great in the new dress I bought her
And don't she look good when she smiles.
Did you really think you were so all important
She couldn't get by on her own
Did you really think losing you would destroy her
She stuck to her promise and talked to her conscious
She did all she could for a while
Now don't she look good when she smiles.
Don't she look good in a new dress I bought her
And the new way that she wears her hair
She's in a new world and she's not the same girl
She knows now that somebody cares.
You can't believe that the same girl you let go
Could change so in this little while
But don't she look great in a new dress I bought her
And don't she look good when she smiles.
On the banks of the river by the railroad track
We kept chickens in a pen in the back
My daddy was a farmer but all he ever raised was us
Salvation Army give us clothes to wear
A man from the county came to cut our hair
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
That was ten dollar less than the landlord wanted for rent
The landlord's letters got nasty indeed
He wrote get out but pa couldn't read
And we was too broke to even pay heed
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
But we had something in our house money can't buy
Kept us warm in the winter cool when the sun was high
For whenever we didn't have food enough
We patched the cracks and set the table with love
I can't take any longer baby I mean I can't wait any longer
To hold you to feel you our lives have touched our minds have touched
Satisfy my hunger you're the only one who can
Where do I have to go what do I have to do
Who do I have to lie to so I can lie with you I can't wait any longer
Patience has never been one of my virtues baby when I want something I want it now
And I want you now I wanna kiss you now I wanna love you now
I can't wait any longer...
I make believe I make believe that you're here with me yes I do
I make believe I make believe that you'll always be my very own yes I do
I guess I'm all wrapped up in a world of make believe
I make believe I make believe every time the phone rings that it's you yes I do
I make believe every time that there's a knock on the door
I make believe it's you yes I do baby
I guess I'm all wrapped up in a world of make believe
And yet faith can move mountains and behind even the darkest cloud the sun can shine
Then I'll be there with you and all of our dreams will come true
Someone you've loved so much before
We ran out of anything to call it so we called it quits.
The longer you live with someone you can't live with
We called it magic then we called it tragic
Finally we called it quits.
It's always been harder to fall out of love than fall in
But I doubt if I'll ever forget where I've been
We couldn't call it happy though it was for a while
The longer you live with someone you can't live with
We called it lovely then we called it lonely
Finally we called it quits.
We called it magic then we called it tragic
Got the alarm clock set for seven
Got the taxi called for nine
Plane takes off at eleven
And I gotta be there on time.
Told the boss I was going to my mother's
Told mama I was gonna see a friend
Out of town on a wild weekend.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little blond haired blue eyed darling
Gonna have a wild weekend.
We might go down to the sea
Somewhere off from the big wide world
Baby's gonna cook me breakfast
Baby's gonna tuck me in
With kisses on a wild weekend.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little blond haired blue eyed darling
Gonna have a wild weekend.
I guess we'll talk about the future
Mostly though we're just gonna sit by the fire
Least one time in his life
Just get away on a wild weekend
Like I'm gonna do with my wife.
Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little mother of my two children
They're not teardrops
They're I love you drops
They were on my pillow when I woke up this morning
They were on the letter I tried all day to write
And just a little while ago I saw them
Falling on your picture as I kissed it goodnight.
You've been gone so long drops.
They're not teardrops
That say I'm lonesome
Never knew this heart could hurt the way it hurts for you
Never lived so many lifetimes in a week
Why don't you come back to me the way you said you would
And kiss these little crystals off my cheek.
You've been gone so long drops.
They're not teardrops
That say I'm lonesome
I happened to walk into a honky tonk
One night down in New Orleans
Up above the bar hung a big guitar
Like none I'd ever seen.
The neck was set with diamonds
And though the strings were old
Like Kings of sound they wound around
Six keys of solid gold.
A man stepped up beside me
His breath was strong with wine
He said you know that guitar once belonged
To a mighty close pal of mine.
He used to play it right here
If you'd care to buy me a drink.
That takes a man a fool
And then he rocked back on his stool.
He just returned from the Great War
His buddies gave him that guitar
At the time it was simple and plain
He added the gold and the diamonds
As he played his way to fame.
He was doing a show in Shreveport
The night he received a call
The greatest show at all.
I was driving him to Nashville
It was cold and misting rain
The signals flashed and the whistle screamed
I swear Mister I never saw that train.
I heard the doctor tell him
Just after he used his knife
You're lucky son it was just your arm
It could have been your life.
More than he could give
He just lost his will to live.
But this world's loss is heaven's gain
And tonight he's still a star
He plays with a band of angels
The old hometown looks the same as I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
And I realize that I was only dreaming
There's a guard and there's a sad old padre arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
I dreamed about my mother dear old daddy sister and brother
And I dreamed about the sweetheart who's waited for so long.
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
By day I make the cars by night I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines.
You know I rode the freight train up north to Detroit City
I think I'm just gonna take my foolish pride
And put on a Southbound freight and ride.
Back to the loved ones who waited for so long
I looked over my guitar and there stood an old man
His cowboy clothes were frayed and worn and his boots were far from new
He said I'd like to sit in with your band I'm a country singer too
Well we just had a big laugh
And when I looked back at the old man there was a tear in his eye
I told the band to cool it I didn't wanna see him cry
He reached down and he took my guitar with a determined look on his face
But as he started to play and sing a look of sadness took its place
He said I've sang my songs from Maine to California
Seen the world through the window of a car
I never saved a dime back when I made it I always thought someday I'd be a star
But now my voice is cracked and no one wants me my wife gave upon me years ago
I wonder if God likes country music will there be a place up there to sing my songs
Will he make my fingers nimble like they used to be
So I can play the chords and sing along
I just stood there none of us really knew what to say
He took my guitar and he put it down ever so gently
And then as he started to turn and leave
The band stood up and applauded and I can still hear his words today he said
A long time ago when the earth was green
Why there was more kinda animals than you've ever seen
And loveliest of them all was the unicorn.
There was green alligators and long neck geese
Some cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born
The loveliest of all was the unicorn
He said hey brother Noah I'll tell you what to do
And take some green alligators and long neck geese
Some cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born
Don't you forget my unicorn.
He marched in the animals two by two
And he called out as they went through.
Some cats and rats and elephants
And then Noah looked out through the driving rain
Green alligators and long neck geese
The unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried
And that's why you've never seen a unicorn to this very day.
You'll see green alligators and long neck geese
Some cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born
Two dollars who will make it three
Three dollars once three dollars twice going for three
And gently picked up the bow
He played a melody as pure and sweet as the caroling angel's sing
The music stopped and the auctioneer with a voice quiet and low said
Two thousand who will make it three
But the Master comes and a change is brought
I'm drinking from my saucer cause my cup has overflowed
You know I never did make my fortune and I guess it's a little late now
But I never did worry about that much
No shoot I was happy anyhow cause you see
As I have journeyed down life's road
I have reaped a lot more than I've sowed
And I'm drinking from my saucer cause my cup has over flowed
No I'm not a man of riches
But I got me a good family an old horse and a dog
They all love me well that makes me rich enough
I thank the Lord for all these bless the mercies he has bestowed
I'm drinking from my saucer cause my cup has overflowed
Oh I've had lots of times when it seemed everything went wrong
I could feel my faith get well just a little bit thin
But the rain would stop and dark clouds would roll away
The sun would come shining right back down in my life again
So Lord don't let me gripe too much about the rough row I've hoed
I'm drinking from my saucer my cup has overflowed
And now Lord if you can just give me the strength I need
And the courage when that old road gets steep and rough
And Lord don't ever let me get so busy that I can't help another with his load
And I just keep on drinking from my saucer cause my cup has surely overflowed
I'm drinking from my saucer cause my cup has overflowed
He was just and old country doctor in a small Georgia town
Fame and fortune had passed him by but we never saw him frown
As day by day in his kindly way he served us one and all
Many a patient forgot to pay although Doc's fees were small
His only ambition it seemed was to find sure cures for aches and ills
Why nearly half the folks in our home town
And there were times he'd receive a fee
But he would pass it on to some poor soul that he said needed it worse than he
So when hard times hit our town and drained each meager purse
He had to sell his furniture why he couldn't even pay his office rent
On the hitching post at the curb below to advertise his wares
And there he kept on helping people get well and his heart was pure gold
But anyone with eyes could see that Doc was getting old
Then one day he didn't even answer when they knocked upon his door
They found him there in his old black suit but on his face was a smile of contentment
So they opened up his ledger and what they saw gave their hearts a pull
Well it looked like the potter's field for Doc and that caused us some alarm
It's a ghastly joke that our town was broke and no one could give a thing
Except Jones the undertaker he did mighty well
He donated an old iron casket he'd never been able to sell
And the funeral procession well it wasn't much for grace and pomp and style
And we breathed a prayer as we laid him there to rest beneath the sod
This man who had earned the right to be on speaking terms with God
His grave was covered with flowers but not from the floral shop
Just roses and things from folks gardens and one or two dandelion tops
For times had hit our town hard and each man carried a load
So some just picked the wild flowers as they passed along the way
We wanted to give Doc a monument we kind of figured we owed him one
But monuments cost money so we just did the best we could
And on his grave we just placed a monument of wood
We pulled up that old hitching post where Doc had nailed his sign
We painted it white and to all of us it surely did look fine
Now the rains and snow has washed away our white trimmings of paint
And there ain't nothing left but Doc's old sign and even that's getting faint
And still when southern breezes and twinkling stars cross our little town
You can still see that old hitching post as if in answer to our prayers
Over all my burdens and through all my fears Jesus carries me
Through all my trials and through all my tears Jesus carries me
One night a man had a dream
And he dreamed he was walking with the Lord
A crossed the sky flashed scenes from his life
For each scene he noted two sets of footprints in the sand
One belonged to him the other to the Lord
When the last scene of his life flashed before him
He looked back at the footprints in the sand
And noticed that many times along the path of his life
There was only one set of footprints
He also noticed that this seemed to happen
At the very lowest and sadist times in his life
This really bothered him and he questioned the Lord about it
Lord you said that once I decided to follow you
You would walk with me all the way but I have noticed
That in the most troublesome times in my life
There are only one set of foot prints
I don't understand why when I needed you the most
And I would never leave you during your times of trial and suffering
When you see only one set of foot prints
It was then that I carried you
Over all my burdens and through all my fears Jesus carries me
Through all my trials and through all my fears Jesus carries me
Oh he carries me across the burning sand over water deep and wide
He gently takes me by the hand and carries me to the other side
You know friends are never earned
They are a gift from the loving God
They're precious beyond human evaluation
You dare not take them for granted
Or they'll drift away like smoke
And the warmth of there caring
Will vanish into the chill of the endless night.
Most of my friends are unknowns
They probably won't even rate an obituary
Unless they live and die in a small town
But some of my friends are big people
Their names are household words
And yet they are no more precious
In God's eyes or in mine.
Then those wonderful nobodies
Who live and die in obscurity
He's someone who warns you with a nod
Or with an unspoken word in hard times
When you are hurting beyond words
She's someone who holds you to her breast
And sighs softly into your hair.
When no other medicine
Could possibly stop the pain
A friend is someone who clinks
A glass against yours
At three in the morning when you're lost
And with a few words of encouragement
And concern makes you realize
Your not really lost at all.
Friends come in both sexes
In all shapes and sizes
The most important thing
They have in common is
Their ability to share with you
Your most sky splitting joys
I think of all the things I have in this world
Were celebrating their anniversary
In all their years together
I'd never seen them disagree.
I said mama what's your secret
Daddy tell me the truth
They laid a little wisdom on me
That I've carried ever since my youth.
If you hold on to love too tight
It'll crumble and crack
If you hold on to love too loosely
It'll fly away and won't come back.
Love has a mind of it's own
It'll dance like a kite on a string
For something that can be so strong
Love is a fragile thing.
Love sure is a fragile thing.
They said your mama and your daddy ain't perfect son
We made our share of mistakes
But we never go to bed when either one's mad
No matter how long it takes.
We sit up and talk things over
Till we work everything out
We kiss goodnight and in the morning
We've forgotten what we argued about.
If you hold on to love too tight
It'll crumble and crack
If you hold on to love too loosely
It'll fly away and won't come back.
True love is a treasure
Can't make myself lie still
My pillowcase is soaking wet
And yet I feel a chill.
It takes all I can do these days
To just survive the nights
It gets crazy when a man
Can't get a woman off his mind.
When a man can't shake a memory
He runs hot and cold and blind
Then he hates her one more time.
Your love has such a grip on me
It chokes me like a vine
Can't get a woman off his mind.
I've been phoning you since eight o'clock
My mind keeps painting pictures
Of you out loving him.
For running out of wine
It gets crazy when a man
Can't get a woman off his mind.
When a man can't shake a memory
He runs hot and cold and blind
Then he hates her one more time.
Drives him crazy when a man
Can't get his woman off his mind.
When a man can't shake a memory
He runs hot and cold and blind
I'd have spent a lot more time out in the pouring rain
Without an umbrella covering my head
And I'd have stood up to that bully when he pushed and shoved
And called me names but I was too afraid
And I'd have gone on and seen Elvis that night
He came to town and Mama said I couldn't
That time she dared me to and I didn't
Oh I I'd have done a lot of things different
I wish I'd have spent more time with my dad when he was alive
Now I don't have the chance
I wish I had told my brother just how much I loved him before he went off to war
But I just shook his hand
And I wish I'd gone to church on Sunday mornings when my grandma begged me to but I was scared of God
And I wish I would have listened when they said
Boy you're gonna wish you had but I wouldn't
Oh I I'd do a lot of things different
People say they wouldn't change a thing even if they could oh but I would
There was this red dress she wanted one time so bad she could taste it
I should have bought it but I didn't
But I wouldn't let her wouldn't have heart nothing
Not nearly enough and if I'd know that was going to be our last dance
I'd have told the band to play on and on and on and on and on
People say they wouldn't change...
Oh I I'd have done a lot of things different
Sometimes there's such a fine line
Between the fire in my heart and the fear in my mind
What do I hold on to what do I leave behind
One day love is rolling down the highway
And the next day love is stopping on a dime
Just when you think you've figured out the answers
Love will change the question every time.
Sometimes there's such a fine line
Between the fire in my heart and the fear in my mind
What do I hold on to what do I leave behind
Could we sit down face to face and talk things over
We can't keep treading water and buying time
Is the love we made together worth the saving
Is the view from on the mountain worth the climb.
Sometimes there's such a fine line
Between the fire in my heart and the fear in my mind
What do I hold on to what do I leave behind
Your world was so different from mine don't you see
And we couldn't be close though we tried
We both reached for heavens but ours weren't the same
That's what happens when two worlds collide.
Your world was made up of things sweet and good
My world could never fit in I wish it could
Two hearts lie in shambles and oh they've cried
It's twelve o'clock again
And here I am slowly driving home
And another night alone.
Before I left this evening
I turned the lights down low and chilled some wine
I thought tonight would be the night
Someone would use that pillow next to mine.
I went to church and got down on my knees
And softly said a prayer
I listened for an answer
But I didn't find it there.
And I searched the neon lights
But I can't find an angel
It seems that everyone I know
Has found someone to love and settle in
But I ain't settled nothing and it's killing me
I've been shot down in flames
I've been stood up and I've been frozen out
I've been hurt but never felt
As helpless as I'm feeling now.
I went to church and got down on my knees
And softly said a prayer
I listened for an answer
But I didn't find it there.
He came to town with a lot of dreams
And four strings on his Gibson
And now he's frying chicken.
He swore someday the world of country music
But he held on to his faded dreams
He drove a beat up Chevy truck
He still leans in that microphone
And he didn't have no money
Says you want some fries with that
The last time that I saw him
Back when he was hungry
He wrote some songs and walked the streets
A big tattoo on both his arms
Sometimes he crawled just like a snake
Without a pit to hiss in those guys make all the money
He looked like Garth and sang like Hank
From now on you can call me.
And everybody loved him
The artist formerly known as Hungry
He swore he'd never change a thing
Back when he was hungry.
And Billboard was a road sign
Not a chart that came on Monday
Back when he was hungry.
And then one day he wrote a song
That got someone's attention
Then Joe called James and James called Don
He's gonna be the next big hot hillbilly.
Well his record went to number one
He hired a band then fired a band
He toured and then got lazy.
Suddenly he knew it all
The rest of us were dummies
He scarcely could remember
Back when he was hungry.
And met this cute young honey
He thought she craved his body
But she only craved his money.
She cleaned out his bank account
Then ran off with his drummer
Left him where he started from
Back when he was hungry.
The reason why I've called us all together
Is to share with you some heartbreaking news
You see there's been a death in the family and as relatives I thought it best you knew
By now you've noticed Betty's not here with me
And Betty won't be joining us tonight I said there's been a death in the family
After all the many years that I've loved her she says she thinks it's best we live apart
Really there's been two deaths in the family Betty's love for me and my poor heart
And I know you'll miss her smiles at Christmas time
But think of me and all the years I've loved her
And pray to God that I don't lose my mind
Oh Lord there's been a death in the family all I've ever loved just fell apart
She came in the door and walked to the bar and I guess my face turned white
I hadn't seen her in a long time and I didn't want to see her tonight
The lady who was sharing the table with me said is that somebody you know
I watched as a stranger bought her a drink and I said you might say so
I did a lot of crazy things back when I was young
And I've still got her footprints on my heart and on my mind
She thought my heart was a revolving door she came and went as she pleased
For every night I spent in her arms I spent two on my knees
Begging her to stay and live in my world needing her desperately
Look up fool in the dictionary and you'll find a picture of me
She's a mistake I made...
But I'm not sure that I'm mature enough to walk away even today
Too country what's that
Is that like too Republican or too Democrat
Are there too many stars in the heavens at night
Are there too many fish that still jump in the stream
Too country what's that
Is it too many pearls of wisdom under Grandpa's old hat
Do the fiddle and steel remind you too much of home.
Is honest and true just not in demand
And I know I'm going home.
And I know I'm going home.
For the folks at home
Hollies in the window
Home where the wind blows
And I know I'm going home.
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing dear if you're not here with me.
I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
I'll have a blue Christmas I know dear
I hope your white Christmas bring you cheer
And when you kneel to say your prayers on this Christmas Eve
I wonder if you'll feel the same as when you prayed with me.
And when those blue snowflakes start falling
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
Who's naughty and nice
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake.
With a little tin horn
And a little toy drum
All around the Christmas tree.
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear.
It's Christmas time in the city
Soon it will be Christmas Day.
Strings of street lights even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you hear.
It's Christmas time in the city
Soon it will be Christmas Day.
I guess I learned to take it for most of the year
But every December when Christmas drew near
Little toy trains and little toy boats
We all sat down and wrote Santa a note
We never heard the jingle of the jingle bells
And if we had Christmas well we just made it ourselves.
Daddy took a hatchet and daddy chopped a pine tree down
The only decorations were the ones we made or found
Brother saw some holly in the rich man's yard
He picked it up fast and ran home hard
And mama knew he stole it but bless her heart
I remember one Christmas it was blowing
Some ladies from the church brought a basket of food
Mama kinda smiled and she said that's good
But why don't you all just take it to the folks
That live down the road
She only kept a chicken and enough
To make some homemade bread
From the blessings that my daddy said
And later when kids was tucked in tight
He made a passel of us
My Christmas list grows shorter every year
Things just aren't the way they were before
My Christmas list grows shorter every year
It's almost not like Christmas anymore.
Christmas was always a big happy time
Course most of the presents just came from the five and dime.
Everybody at my house used to laugh and said that I was born
With a little too much of the spirit of Christmas in me.
And it seemed then that things started to change
Christmases seem sorta strange.
Sister ran off with some weird kinda guy
I never did understand him too much
My kid brother's off somewhere in the service
And he never was the kind to stay in touch.
Course I started my own family a few years ago
My wife and I had two of the cutest little girls
I bought them just about everything in the whole wide world.
And I remember on the Christmas Eve night
And I told them the story of Jesus
And the Santa Claus and the eight tiny reindeer
All I wish now is the spirit of Christmas
Could have lingered throughout the whole year.
You see my wife left me back in September
The kids are with her I don't know where
I'd love to just send them a small Christmas card
To let them know that daddy does care.
And your heart with the ones that you love the best
I don't even have one single address.
My Christmas list grows shorter every year
My Christmas list grows shorter every year
People seem to celebrate the season in so many different ways
Some go where the weather's freezing cold while others like it warm
I don't care about the weather just whether I spend Christmas in your arms
We could sail down to the islands where the gentle breezes blow
My world lay cold and shattered in the ashes of a dream that fell apart
And the arms you wrap around me and the precious gift of love you give to me
He was born in an obscure village
The son of a simple peasant woman
He grew up in another small town
And worked with his father
In a carpenter shop until He was thirty
And then for three years he was
What we might call a traveling preacher.
He never wrote a book
He never held political office
The places He did go He usually walked
He never did any of the things
That one normally associates with greatness
He had no credentials but himself.
The tide of public opinion turned against Him
Some of His friends deserted Him one denied Him
One even betrayed Him and turned Him over to His enemies.
He went through the mockery of a trial
He was nailed to a cross between two thieves
While He was dying His executioners gambled
When He was dead he was taken from the cross
By the compassion of friends.
Almost twenty wide centuries have since come and gone
And today this man is the centerpiece of the human race
The leader in the column of mankind problems
I think I am well with in the mark
That all the armies that ever marched
All the navies that ever sailed the seven seas
All the legislative bodies that ever met
All the kings and rulers that have ever rained
And all put together have not affected
The life of man here on this earth
As much as that one solitary life.
I was standing by my window on a cold cold cloudy day
When I saw that hearse come rolling for to carry my mother away
Will the circle be unbroken by and by Lord by and by
There's a better home awaiting in the sky Lord in the sky
Will the circle be unbroken in the sky Lord in the sky
Come home come home ye who are weary come home
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners were slain.
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown.
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share.
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
I wandered so aimless life filled with sin I wouldn't let my dear Saviour in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light I saw the light no more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight praise the Lord I saw the light
Just like a blind man I wandered along worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like a blind man that God gave back his sight praise the Lord I saw the light
I was a fool to wander and stray straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right praise the Lord I saw the light
I plowed the fields and I planted the seed
I worked my hands to the bone
But the ground laid barren till He sent the sunshine
For I can do nothing alone.
I raised the corn and I rode to the mill
With the best crop I ever had grown
But the wheel wouldn't grind till He stirred the waters
For I can do nothing alone.
I can do nothing alone
I'm weak and my Master is strong
I held the pencil but He wrote this song
For I can do nothing alone.
And now as my years lead me into the valley
I've asked Him to please come home
For I walk in search of the good life hereafter
And I can do nothing alone.
I can do nothing alone
I'm weak and my Master is strong
I held the pencil but He wrote this song
Sweet hour of prayer sweet hour of prayer
That calls me from a world of care
And bids me at my father's throne
Makes all my wants and wishes known
In seasons of distress and grief
My soul has often found relief
By Thy return sweet hour of prayer
Sweet hour of prayer sweet hour of prayer
Thy wings shall my petition bear
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless
And since he bids me seek his face
Believe his word and trust his grace
I'll cast on him my every care
Living below in this old sinful world
Hardly a comfort can afford
Striving alone to face temptations call
Where could I go to the Lord
Where could I go where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord
Neighbors are fun I love them everyone
We get along in sweet accord
But when I pass the chilling hand of death
Where could I go to the Lord
Where could I go where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord
Life here is grand with friends I love so well
Comfort I get from God's own Word
But when my soul needs manna from above
Where could I go to the Lord
Where could I go where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord
Where could I go where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord
Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us never molested though in the wrong
Farther along we'll know all about it farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine we'll understand it all by and by
When we see Jesus coming in glory when he comes from his home in the sky
Then we shall meet him in that bright mansion we'll understand it all by and by
Glory glory glory somebody touched me
Glory glory glory somebody touched me
Glory glory glory somebody touched me must've been the hand of the Lord
I'm going to let it shine.
I'm going to let it shine.
Gonna let my little light shine.
I'm going to let it shine.
I'm going to let it shine.
Gonna let my little light shine.
Now some say you got to run and hide.
But we say there's no place to hide.
But we say let the people decide.
But we say the time's just right.
I'm going to let it shine.
I'm going to let it shine.
Whatever will be will be
Just wait and you'll see
With no meow to follow
So I turned out the lights
Laid my head on a pillow
I got them really sad blues
I got them really sad blues
You think like an arrow
Like a bullet or a dart
Casper lives in a world without promise
Sitting at home in his pajamas
Just wishing it would all go away somehow
We walked by but he never saw us
He could have been a famous guitarist
He must have not had a clue
Feeling like a bowl of spaghetti
Not knowing what to give
He's the one with hope in his soul
Can't let him slip through the hole
He might just go away and never return
He's hanging on a whim and a prayer
So glad to see him there
Maybe he'll make it some day some way...
Going past the expected
Maybe he'll get what he wants
Good golly it's getting moldy
Got to move on but oh no
Something may turn out of sight
But you never really know
Thinking only may be his might
Things may turn out right
I'd chase him through the ditches and sting him on the bridges
And I'd make him let honey down
I'd never get my honey from an old clover bloom
It ain't sweet enough for me
I'd meet her in the meadow every morning and noon just before the setting of the sun
We'd both take flight through the pale blue sky and return by the light of the moon
If I was boss of the hive and say both it root hole got died
I have the invitation that you sent me
You wanted me to see you change your name
I couldn't stand to see you wed another
But I hope you're happy just the same
Down the aisle with someone else you're walking
So wedding bells will never ring for me
I planned a little cottage in the valley
I even bought a little band of gold
I thought some day I'd place it on your finger
But now the future looks so dark and cold
At home alone I hang my head in sorrow
Those wedding bells will never ring for me
I fancy that I see a bunch of roses
A blossom from an orange tree in your hair
While the organ plays I love you truly
Just let me pretend that I am there
Ever since the day you set me free
I knew some day that you would find another
There's a black tow truck with his headlights on
And there's a slow procession across the graveyard lawn
With a real cool cat sitting at the wheel
The obituaries in the papers say
That he up and went and rocked his life away
I want a rockabilly funeral when I die
A rockabilly singer getting buried in his car
With the back seat covered in the records I made
And that old Telecaster that I always played
Cadillac's pointed towards Memphis T
Where the King made rockabilly history
I want a rockabilly funeral when I die
Put a lot of echo on the preacher's mike
When he tells them that my memory's rocking on
Be sure you get to shaking when he starts to shout
I want a rockabilly funeral when I die
I want a rockabilly funeral when I die
I want a rockabilly funeral when I die
I want a rockabilly funeral when I die
When he tells them that my memory's rocking on
Be sure you get to shaking when he starts to shout
I want a rockabilly funeral when I die
A rockabilly funeral when I die
A rockabilly funeral when I die
I want a rockabilly funeral when I die
I want a Wurlitzer jukebox for my tombstone
Stuck it on a slab of ash
Sent him out with Johnny Cash
That the honky twang of the Telecaster tone
It's all up in your face
It was born at the junction of form and function
Long before fish every walked on land
Time was turning rocks into sand
Sand that slips through the hands of a man
So I built my castle close by the shore
And I slept on the sands of the ocean's roar
Then I came to understand
That my house was built on shifting sand
So we went to the hill and built us a town
With beautiful views for miles around
When the mountain shook and tumbled down
We knew we built on shaky ground
Before fish every walked on land
Time was turning rocks into sand
Sand that slips through the hands of a man
Now the sands will shift and the earth's gonna roll
The rocks and the rain will collect their toll
And all I'll take is what I brought
And I may not get what I sought
Whether I sink or I fall
That's up to the shifting sands after all
Before fish every walked on land
Devil with the blue dress on
Devil with the blue dress on
Got to be the finest girl alive
She's a real humdinger and I like it like that
Devil with the blue dress on
Devil with the blue dress on
If it's really gotta be this way
Until I make it on my own
I'll cry but I'll get by
And I'll forget you someday
If it's really gotta be this way
If this is what you think you need
Then go ahead girl and do it
It doesn't make a lot of sense to me
I'll cry but I'll get by
And I'll forget you someday
If it's really gotta be this way
There'll always be a place for you
I will always believe
I'll cry but I'll get by
And I'll forget you someday
If it's really gotta be this way
If it's really gotta be this way
I can make it on my own
That's what I'll do If you should leave me with the blues
For me there'll be no moonlight
If ever we should part
My eyes will cry and never dry if you should go
When shadows creep I'll just weep all night I know
You know how much I'd miss you
If ever we should part
There's where I have roamed for many long years
There's where the first step of misfortune I made
It's about thirty years when I courted and married
My brother he stabbed me for some unknown reason
Just three month's later I'd taken Tom's life
I was captured and tried in the village of Kingston
Not a man in that county would speak one kind word
A lifetime in prison was the words that I heard
And sister she sat all alone with a sigh
Toiling and working my poor life away
They'll measure my grave on the banks of old Cumberland
Just as soon as I finish the rest of my days
Boys when you write home from this prison in Nashville
I weeped and moaned over his grave and to me boys it was sad
My best pal was my old paint horse and now he's gone to rest
I laid him down beneath that mound in Texas away out West
Where the cactus blooms over his grave and the coyotes cry
I know he sleeps in perfect peace beneath the Texas sky
Dear old pal it breaks my heart to leave you here alone
Now I'll go and ride the range on the Texas roan
But my love for you old pal it shall linger on
Out in the cold world and far away from home
No one to guide him or keep his footsteps right
Some mother's boy is homeless tonight.
Bring back to me my wandering boy
For there is no other who's left to give me joy
Tell him that his mother with faded cheeks and hair
Is at the old home place awaiting him there
Out in the hallway then stands a vacant chair
And an old pair of shoes he used to wear
Empty is the cradle he used to love so well
Oh how I miss him no tongue can tell.
Well meet up yonder where tears are never shed
Till a good woman's love made a new man of me
Till a good woman's love put me back on my feet
And I know that no matter what happens she'll always care
And when night falls and the moon shines above
On a beautiful cloud you see
So you will know that I want you
In my beautiful memories and dreams
Come back to me in my dreams love
Come back to me in sweet dreams
I'm heartbroke I'm sad and I'm weary
Come back to me in my dreams
When the bright moon shines up in Heaven
It seems that you are so near me
But yet it is only a dream
It seems I'll never more see you
Till we meet in Heaven it seems
But I hold you close to my heart love
I bid farewell to my home so dear
And started down life's road
I was a fortune seeking miner dear
Many things had been my goal
There's many things I've seen in life
I thought I'd like to roam
But I'd give them all and more if I
Could get off this lonesome road
It's a lonesome road to travel on
Many miles of sorrow is all I've know
But I've gone too far to turn back now
From this lonesome lonesome road
I left behind a love that's true
She cried and begged me not to go
But my foolish pride told me what to do
And put me on this lonesome road
Oh such lonely nights I've never found
No time in life before
If she takes me back I'll settle down
It was in the spring one sunny day
My good gal left me Lord she went away
And now she's gone but I don't worry
She called me up from down in El Paso
Show me a woman a man can trust
The woman I'm loving is on the other side
I got me in bed and covered my head
Wish I was dead with Sally Jo
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
Since you have gone my days are turned to night
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
The hurt you left has just begun to show
Sally Jo I've been so low
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
I'm like a little dog left out to stray
No one wants me no place to stay
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
Did I do bad or was I good to you
The torch I carried had a light so bright
For me to see Sally Jo
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
I'm breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
Don't look at me like you think I've got the blues
I'm just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
Ah ha so I'm talking to myself
Oh no she's not putting me on the shelf
I'm just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
I'm doggone if I'm gonna cry the blues
My feet are sore but I've got no time to lose
He run all around Memphis he beat the Memphis train
Beat the Memphis train O Lord beat the Memphis train
Fever in my head O Lord fever in my head
Out in California where Molly done as she pleased
Come back to old Kentucky got beat with all ease
Beat with all ease O Lord beat with all ease
Clear out of sight O Lord clear out of sight
We're gonna bury old Molly in a coffin ready made
As I travel down life's pathway
Knowing not what the years may hold
As I ponder hopes grow fonder
Precious memories flood my soul
Precious Memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious father loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes from my childhood
People steal they cheat and lie
For wealth and what it will buy
But don't they know on judgment day
That gold and silver will melt away
I'd rather be in a dark grave
And to know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul
What good is gold and silver too
If your hearts not pure and true
Sinner hear me when I say
High on that lonesome road to heaven's blessed abode
For many years I was burdened with care
So often lightening flashed and raging billows dashed
My sorrow then was so heavy to bear
But since my Jesus came I praise his holy name
He sheds the light of his wonderful grace
And every night and day to him I steal away
I found a blessed hiding place
I found a hiding place a blessed hiding place
I said a hiding a blessed hiding place
There's glory in my soul my hallelujah rolls
But since my Jesus came I'm under his control
He keeps me night and day He answers when I pray
And from the raging storm to Him I steal away
Just like a wandering Jew that had no place to choose
But now I've found the way that leads to endless days
No more in darkness I wander alone
When Satan would alarm I climb in God's strong arm
And hide away in his loving embrace
For in the solid rock the blessed solid rock
I wandered so aimless my heart filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear Savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light
Just like a blind man I wandered alone
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
I'll meet you in the morning by the bright riverside
When all sorrow has drifted away
At the close of life's long weary day
I'll meet you in the morning with a how do you do
And we'll sit down by the river and when all the rapture is renewed
You'll know me in the morning by the smile that I wear
When I meet you in the morning In the city that is built four square
I will meet you in the morning in the sweet by and by
And exchange the old cross for a crown
There will be no disappointments and nobody shall die
In the state of West Virginia among the peaceful rolling hills
I met a mountain maid with eyes of blue
Golden hair so soft and curly and her lips were like the dew
Calling like a lonesome dove my Linda Lou
When the moon is in the blue and the stars are shining too
Can't you hear my lonely heart calling for you Linda Lou
I recall the night I met her how I held her hand in mine
I recall the night we kissed and said adieu
Many miles may separate us if I should cross the ocean blue
Will they fly from the trees and tap at my window
Will he lie on the rug by the side of my bed
I've seen tears come in his honest eyes
As he gazed on my cheeks growing paler everyday
His hand trembled over my hair
I know he will mourn for me too
Keep him in old and unless he grows
Sleeping all along summer through
His master then will be dead
Speak to him kindly and often of Joe
Pat him on his brown shaggy head
But in heaven no larger I grow
And any kind angel will open the gate
When you ask for your darling Little Joe
And any kind angel will open the gate
There was a time when I thought of no other
And we sang our own love's refrain
And out hearts beat as one as we had our fun
But time changes everything
Our romance seemed all in vain
The dark clouds are gone and there's blue skies again
Yes time changes everything
The time has passed and I have forgot you
I guess it is true for me and for you
Cause time changes everything
Oh you can change the name of an old song
Rearrange it and make it swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you
But time changes everything
I can't say we won't love again
You have gone your way and I'll go mine
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die.
A freighter said she's been here
But she just walked up the block.
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone.
Dump my blues down in the gulf.
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.
Those pretty wild flowers I love them so well
The flowers know secrets that I'll never tell
I go out to pick a bouquet of all
And bring them all in before the leaves start to fall
When the leaves start to fall and the flowers have died
If only little darling I could be by your side
Soon the wild flowers will bloom again in the spring
I wish I could see her and talk of our love
And of all the pretty flowers sent here from above
Oh maybe I'll see her in Heaven someday
And pick pretty flowers as we go on our way
The memories of you dear I'll never erase
There'll never be another that can take your place
I'll still keep our secret with the flowers of love
It's mighty dark for me to travel
For my sweetheart she is gone
The road is rough and filled with gravel
But I must journey on and on
To me she was a little angel
Sent down to me from God above
And on the day that I first met her
Then I told her of my love
Many a night we strolled together
Talking of our love so fair
My love for her will never vanish
Oh I know I'll meet her there
Traveling down this lonesome highway
Thinking of my love who's gone
Knowing soon we'll be together
Where is the love that you promised neath the pine
Gone like the flowers in the fall
You crossed your heart now you're double crossing mine
I was sold down the river to a port of broken dreams
Drifting in sorrow down the stream
Sold down the river on a ship that won't return
When it anchors in the sea of broken dreams
I never dreamed that your love would grow so cold
Hiding behind the rainbow's end
You must be blind for the glitter of the gold
Gold that can never find a friend
I was sold down the river to a port of broken dreams
Drifting in sorrow down the stream
Sold down the river on a ship that won't return
When it anchors in the sea of broken dreams
You'll never know what it means to sit and cry
After your heart is broken too
Someday you'll learn and your soul will burn and die
When some one double crosses you
I was sold down the river to a port of broken dreams
Drifting in sorrow down the stream
Sold down the river on a ship that won't return
I'm going down this road feeling bad
I'm going down this road feeling bad
They feed me on corn bread and beens
They feed me on corn bread and beens
I ain't got no shoes on my feet
I ain't got no shoes on my feet
It takes a ten dollar shoe to fit my foot
It takes a ten dollar shoe to fit my foot
I'm going where the climate suits my clothes
I'm going where the climate suits my clothes
Oh yonder stands little Maggie
With a dram glass in her hands
She's drinking away her troubles
Oh how can I ever stand it
Just to see them two blue eyes
Like two diamonds in the sky
Last time a saw little Maggie
And a banjo on her knee
Lay down your last gold dollar
Lay down your gold watch and chain
Little Maggie's gonna dance for daddy
Listen to that old banjo ring
Pretty flowers were made for blooming
Pretty stars were made to shine
I think you played the game right from the start
This toy heart was broken
When parting words were spoken
You played with my poor heart like a toy
That toy broke and then we had to part
It never can be mended
I hope this romance's ended
Time alone will heal my broken heart
The clouds will roll away
The sun will shine someday
Your love for me has passed and gone
I'll find somebody new
I hope that they'll be true
I'm going back to old Kentucky
There to see my Linda Lou
I'm going back to old Kentucky
Where the skies are always blue
When my left old Kentucky
Linda kissed me and she cried
I told her that I would not linger
I'd be back by and by
Linda Lou is she is a beauty
Those pretty brown eyes I loved so well
I'm going back to old Kentucky
Never more to say farewell
Linda Lou you know I love you
I long for you each night and day
When the roses bloom in old Kentucky
They tell me that you are going away
You gave me your love and you gave me your vow
Don't leave me here to cry
I never could live if we should part
Tell me you don't mean goodbye
Stayed awake last night and I walked the floor
I don't want to live if you go
You're the one who's made me love you so
You're the one who'd break my heart if you go
This nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
Up on the mountain just to see my honey
This nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
This nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
That rings like mine that rings like mine
This nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
It rings like silver and shines like gold
It rings like silver and shines like gold
This nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
Somebody stole my nine pound hammer
This nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
That nine pound hammer that killed John Henry
This nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in my cradle
In those old cotton fields back home
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in my cradle
In those old cotton fields back home
You can't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields back home
It was back in Louisiana
In them old cotton fields back home
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in my cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in my cradle
In those old cotton fields back home
You can't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields back home
It was back in Louisiana
In those old cotton fields back home
So drunk that he could not see.
The tears running down from his eyes.
The first one to visit John Hardy in his cell
Was a little girl dressed in blue.
Was a little girl dressed in red.
Shady Grove my little love
Shady Grove my little love
Went to see my Shady Grove
And her little bare feet on the floor
Shady Grove my little love
Shady Grove my little love
She's the darling of my heart
Prettiest little thing in town
Shady Grove my little love
Shady Grove my little love
I wish I had a big fine horse
And corn to feed him on
And Shady Grove to stay at home
And feed him when I'm gone
Shady Grove my little love
Shady Grove my little love
When I was a little boy
And now I want little Shady Grove
To say she'll be my wife
Shady Grove my little love
Shady Grove my little love
I will not go to Old Joe's house
I'll tell ya the reason why
Is filled with chicken pie
Old Joe Clark he did take sick
He drank a churn of butter milk
And then his stomach failed him
I will not marry an old maid
And I'll tell ya the reason why
Her neck's so long and stringy boys
I'm afraid she'll never die
Old Joe Clark he did get drunk
And he sat down to his supper
He leaned over at the dinner table
When I was young in my prime
I left my home in Caroline
Now all I do is sit and pine
For all the folks I left behind
I've got those blue ridge mountain blues
My grip is packed to travel
And I'm scratching gravel
For that blue ridge far away
I'm gonna stay right by my ma
I'm gonna do right by my pa
Lay around the cabin door
No work on worry anymore
I've got those blue ridge mountain blues
What to see my old day tray
Where the corn top blossom
On that blue ridge far away
I see a window with the light
It seems I can hear them both recite
Where is my wondering boy tonight
I'm got those blue ridge mountain blues
And I stand right here to say
Want to be back in Tennessee
Way down in Columbus Stockade
Friends all turned their backs on me
Go and leave me if you wish to
Never let it cross your mind
If in your heart you love another
Last night as I lay sleeping
When I awoke I was mistaken
I was peering through the bars
Many a night with you I've rambled
Many an hour with you I've spent
Thought I had your heart forever
We all loved our fair tender maiden
From her eyes the light of Heaven shone through
She fell sick one cold winter morning
And there was nothing we could do
She lay on her death bed so bravely
Her face all tired and worn
We knew in our hearts she was leaving
God had called her to His heavenly home
As she lay on the bed she was smiling
It was her only way of saying goodbye
And tomorrow she'd lay neath the ground
The fragrance of flowers from her grave
Goes to heaven where she has gone too
Mortal pain shown on all our faces
But there was nothing we could do
When the preacher began to console us
His words rang out clear and true
He said God called her that's the reason
As he walked along the old familiar beat
He saw a little bay crying and thought his heart would break
Standing bare foot in the middle of the street
I was left on the street with no shoes upon my feet
When I saw my mom and daddy drive away
Now I'm not old enough to know every much myself
But I saw my dad and mommy drive away
I'm not big enough to know just what went wrong
I was left on the street with no shoes upon my feet
When I saw my mom and daddy drive away
Now I'm not old enough to know every much myself
But I saw my dad and mommy drive away
The little boy is happy now with a new mom and dad
His new daddy is the policeman on the beat
He has a brand new pair of shoes upon his feet
I was left on the street with no shoes upon my feet
When I saw my mom and daddy drive away
Now I'm not old enough to know every much myself
For losing you would be more than I could bear
For I don't want a cheap love affair
I knew we loved each other the night that we first met
It just happened there was nothing we could do
Let me stay with my children till they can understand
That I love them and they'll know I love you too
For losing you would be more than I could bear
For I don't want a cheap love affair
When I'm free I'll make you happy if you'll only wait for me
But I don't want a cheap love affair
For losing you would be more than I could bear
My heart is so lonely and blue
When friends ask about you why you're not around
How will I explain about you
How will I explain about you
They know I've been faithful and true
So when they start asking why you're not around
How will I explain about you
They saw us together for such a long time
They knew that I loved you so true
But now that you've gone and I'm left all alone
How will I explain about you
How will I explain about you
I can't let them know that we're through
They wouldn't believe it could ever be true
How will I explain about you
How will I explain about you
I'm leaving it all up to you
And if you insist that our pathway must part
Your love is colder than a foggy river
You left me stranded on this foggy river
Cold and helpless and alone
I knew someday that you would turn me down
I got worries on my mind
Yes I'm doomed to sail this foggy river
Till I leave my love behind
There's no tomorrow on this foggy river
Only memories linger on
A mist of sorrows fills this foggy river
Everything I had is gone
I can't escape this broken heart of mine
I've no freedom anymore
Heaven help me on this foggy river
Love oh love careless love
Love oh love careless love
Love oh love oh careless love
See what careless love has done
Once I wore my apron low
Once I wore my apron low
Once I wore my apron low
I couldn't keep you from my door
What oh what will mama say
What oh what will mama say
What oh what will mama say
When she learns I've gone astray
I love my mama and papa too
I love my mama and papa too
I love my mama and papa too
Now I wear my apron high
Now I wear my apron high
Now I wear my apron high
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide its face and cry
Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die
I'm so lonesome I could cry
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
By the mill stream sits the Miller's pretty daughter
Her cheeks are like the first red rose of June
Her sweet voice sounds just like the rippling water
As so tenderly she hums an old love tune
But soon her song of joy has turned to sorrow
Her sweetheart now has come to say goodbye
She thinks of a sad and lonely morrow
When the bees are in the hive and the honey in the comb
And the golden sunlight bends to kiss the dew
And when the bees are in the hive I'll come to you
By the old mill sits the lonely maid repining
And her face was like the spring rose far away
While she looked down in the silver waters shining
Long years she's waited there for his returning
All in vain she's thinking he'll come back someday
For the lamp of hope still in her heart is burning
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
Poppa writes to Johnny but Johnny can't come home
Poppa writes to Johnny but Johnny can't come home
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
High sheriff and police riding after me
High sheriff and police riding after me
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
She's the best gal this poor boy ever had
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
Oh why did you leave me in this lonesome place
With four walls around me and a memory of your face
Why can't I be happy why can't I forget
With four walls around me I wish we'd never met
With four walls around me it gets so lonesome dear
Dreaming of you darling and wishing you were here
Four walls around me my heart is full of pain
Trying to forget you but it's all in vain.
With four walls around you you'll remember how you done me wrong
Your time is coming and I know it won't be long
Oh the people would come from far away
They'd dance all night till the break of day
You knew Uncle Pen was ready to go
Late in the evening about sundown
High on the hill and above the town
Uncle Pen played the fiddle lord how it would ring
To me that's where the fiddle begins
I'll never forget that mournful day
When Uncle Pen was called away
When you live in the country
Everybody is your neighbor
On this one thing you can rely
They'll all come to see you
And right after dinner
They ain't looking any thinner
And here's what you hear them say
They'd come to the kitchen
And help do the dishes right away
You can still hear Grandma say
I want to thank Jesus for the way that I feel
I'm so full of religion I just can't be still
I want to sing it and shout it and let the people know
That I'm saved by his mercy and I'm ready to go
Yes I'm happy happy on my way
For Jesus is near me and there he will stay
Yes I'm happy happy on my way
I just can't see why you sinners go on
Denying yourself his wonderful love
What a wonderful feeling just to know I am saved
And then he will greet me at heaven's open door
Shine on the one whose gone and proved untrue
Shine on the one whose gone and left me blue
It was on a moonlit night
The stars were shining bright
They whispered from on high
Your love has said goodbye
Do you need another mule skinner
With a blacksnake whip to toss
I've got a good woman
I can make any mule listen
Or I won't accept no pay
A star fell from heaven right into my arms
A brighter star I know I've never seen
Then I found out that it was only you with all your charms
Who came into my life to fill a dream
A fallen star is what you are
The twinkle in your eyes came from the sky
You must have strayed from the milky way
A fallen star that's what you are
The heavens must be lonely now that you are mine
I'm sure they'll miss a star as bright as you
But the stars will send there blessing and brighter they will shine
Plant some flowers by my graveside
Just a little bunch of them
Since your hand has planted them
You see my name there on a slab
Won't you stop a little while dear
For I would be lonesome there
You will do this last request
Now some folks like the summertime when the they can walk about
Strolling through the meadow green it's pleasant there no doubt
But give me the wintertime when the snow is on the ground
For I found her when the snow on the ground
I traced her little footprints in the snow
I found her little footprints in the snow
I bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way
For I found her when the snow was on the ground
I dropped in to see her there was a big round moon
Her mother said she just stepped out but would be returning soon
I found her little footprints and I traced them in the snow
I found her when the snow was on the ground
Now she's up in heaven she's with the angel band
I know I'm going to meet her in that promised land
But every time the snow falls it brings back memories
Troubled all the time
That some other woman
Has took my love from you
She's got another man and gone
Next time you see your daddy
Runs from by back door
I went downtown thought I had a dime
Got home this morning didn't have a dime
Come home this morning about half past eight
She said honey you're out too late
I went in the house to start the fire
She kicked me out in the middle of the night
I fell in the yard mad as I can be
Said to my dog make room for me
If I had my way I'd leave here today
I'd find me a place where I could stay
And not have to worry
A place I could lose the Tennessee Blues
I'd find me a spot on some mountain top
With no one around me
And hills that surround me.
I'd try to forget all my regrets
I'd keep just the good times
No answer to my letter
To soothe my aching heart
True love like ours to part
No letter in the mail today
No answer from my love
Nobody knows what I've been through
This is what I wrote to her
I know that I'm to blame
I know that I have broken your heart
And then I signed my name
No letter in the mail today
No answer from my love
Nobody knows what I've been through
I'm traveling down this road today
If there's no letter in the box
I'm leaving this world behind
No letter in the mail today
No answer from my love
Nobody knows what I've been through
It's the orange blossom special
Ring the bell Bill ring the bell
Hey Bill where ya gonna get off this train at
Down at about Atlanta Georgia
Down at Nashville Tennessee
Good morning captain good morning son
Do you need another mule skinner
Out on your new road line
Well I like to work I'm rolling all the time
Lord I like to work boy I'm rolling all the time
I can pop my initials Right on a mule's behind
And if you don't like your job just set that water bucket down
I work out on the new road from a dollar and a dime a day
Lord I work out on the new road I make a dollar and a dime a day
I've got three women on Saturday night Waiting to draw my pay
Well I'm going to town honey what can I bring you back
Well I'm going to town baby what can I bring you back
Lord it's raining here and it's storming on the deep blue sea
Lord it's raining here and it's storming on the deep blue sea
Just throw your good gal out the window let your house just burn on down
Well I'm leaving here and I ain't gonna take no clothes
I'm leaving here and I ain't gonna take no clothes
The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia line
The engine passed at six o'clock
And the cab passed by at nine
Where the sun never shines
And we shiver when the cold wind blows
I asked my captain for the time of day
A long steel rail and a short cross tie
I'm on my way back home
That makes you treat me so
You caused me to leave my home
My father was an engineer
Died a mile out of town
His head was found in the driving gear
Did you ever wonder about the riddle
What kind of spirit lives in a fiddle
Or are you tuned with the angel band
Back off of sin and let Glory in
You can't go wrong singing this song
Back up and push away
Prepare to suffer the consequences
The foolish measure of the worldly pleasure
Can only drag you to the roaring fire
Back off of sin and let Glory in
You can't go wrong singing this song
I weeped and moaned over his grave and to me boys it was sad
My best pal was my old paint horse and now he's gone to rest
I laid him down beneath that mound in Texas away out West
Where the cactus blooms over his grave and the coyotes cry
I know he sleeps in perfect peace beneath the Texas sky
Dear old pal it breaks my heart to leave you here alone
Now I'll go and ride the range on the Texas roan
But my love for you old pal it shall linger on
I hate to see the sun sink low
Just for a cause you ought to know
For it's true love I can't forget
All of my sorrow you'll soon regret
You promised me love that was true
And I'm sorry to say that I believed in you
It's all turned out just like a dream
Left me so sad in the world it seems
There's dishes to wash and a house to clean
There's a million words I can't explain
They'll go away and leave you at home
They never care if you're alone
They seem to forget they've got a wife
There's folks building homes as sweet as can be
But my little hut I'll just let it be
Lord Jesus is building a mansion for me
Built by my Lord beyond Calvary
But my little hut I'll just let it be
Lord Jesus is building a mansion for me
Each day I am getting more ready to go
He's cleansing my sins more whiter than snow
I'm packing my troubles I'm bound with his love
Get ready to move to Heaven above
To you who have homes in this world below
Driving fine cars wherever you go
There's coming a time when we'll all pass away
Summertime is past and gone and I'm on my way back home
To see the only one I ever loved
Now the room is shining bright it lights my pathway tonight
Back to the only one I ever loved
She was sent to me from God above
Now the moon is shining bright it lights my pathway tonight
I think you played the game right from the start
This toy heart was broken
When parting words were spoken
You played with my poor heart like a toy
That toy broke and then we had to part
It never can be mended
I hope this romance's ended
Time alone will heal my broken heart
The clouds will roll away
The sun will shine someday
Your love for me has passed and gone
I'll find somebody new
I hope that they'll be true
On Saturday night when our work is done
We load our music up on the run
We got to ramble ramble there's heavy traffic ahead
We pull out of Nashville right on time
The Blue Grass special heads down the line
We traveled around from state to state
The Bluegrass boys are never late
Late in the evening about sundown
You know we've come from some other town
We do our work with a good will
You told me that your love was true
But now you left me all alone
I have no one to call my own
You have left me all alone
Maybe there will come a time
I never shall forget the day
When you said you were going away
I couldn't believe that it was true
After all the love I had for you
This road is rough and rocky too
But I'm still praying for the time
Let's all kneel down at the altar
And pray that our souls might be free.
I'll meet you in church Sunday morning
And we'll all kneel down and pray
We'll pray to our Lord up in heaven
To guide us safe home on our way.
It's a place where we all meet on Sunday
To worship our Lord up above
And let all of our sins be forgiven
And meet with our loved ones above.
I'll meet you in church Sunday morning
And we'll all kneel down and pray
We'll pray to our Lord up in heaven
To guide us safe home on our way.
From the land where there's one endless day
Let's all be prepared to meet Jesus
The path is narrow to that home far away.
I'll meet you in church Sunday morning
And we'll all kneel down and pray
We'll pray to our Lord up in heaven
Out on the perilous deep
Where dangers silently creep
And storms so violently sweep
You're drifting to far from the shore
You're drifting to far from the shore
Today the tempest rolls high
And clouds overshadow the sky
Sure death is hovering nigh
You're drifting to far from the shore
Why meet a terrible fate
Mercy abundantly waits
Turn back before its to late
Let me rest at the end of my journey
Let me rest at the end of my journey
Heaven is my home and my goal
We'll ride the range no more
Let me rest at the end of my journey
Heaven is my home and my goal
A cowboy's life on the old Texas trail
Herding doggies is all that he knows
A cowboy's life on the old cattle trail
On the harps of gold.
Farther along we'll know more about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
Tempted and tried will oft make you wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested though in the wrong
When death has found and taken our loved ones
Leaving our home so lonely and dreary
Then do we wonder why others prosper
Though the streams are swollen
Through rain and wind and weather
Hell bent for leather
Now come and listen to my story
My story that I know is true
A little rose bloomed in Georgia
With marigold and a heart of gold
Way down in the Blue Ridge mountains
Way down where the tall pines grow
There's my sweetheart of the mountain
She's my little Georgia rose
My mother left her with another
A carefree life she had planned
The baby now is a lady
The one her mother couldn't stand
Way down in the Blue Ridge mountains
Way down where the tall pines grow
There's my sweetheart of the mountain
She's my little Georgia rose
We often sang old songs together
I watched her do her little part
She smiled at me when I would tell her
That she was my sweetheart
Way down in the Blue Ridge mountains
Way down where the tall pines grow
There's my sweetheart of the mountain
I can't answer her letter
For she left me no address
You should know my little darling
You left my poor heart in distress
I got a letter from my darling
She said she hated to go
It broke my heart the words she wrote me
She closed by saying I love you so
She wrote the words she knew would hurt me
She said I never could be true
I've tried I've tried my little darling
To prove my love was just for you
This letter meant goodbye forever
Though we'll have each other's hearts
Our love will fade away in sadness
Mother left this world of sorrow
Our home was silent and so sad
Dad took sick and had to leave us
I have no home No mother nor dad
There's a little lonesome grave yard
I often go out to the graveyard
I can almost hear them whisper
Trust in god He'll do the rest
Their souls have gone up to heaven
Where they'll dwell with god above
Where they'll meet there friends and loved ones
Life was so bright and gay everything complete
But I fell for another who led my life astray
So I'll live in sorrow till my dying day
Down the highway of sorrow I'm traveling alone
I've lost all my true friends I've lost a happy home
I'm heading for destruction I'm on the wrong track
Down the highway of sorrow there's no turning back
I went back to my darling I got down on my knees
I begged her with tear rimmed eyes to give my poor heart ease
But she was hurt so deeply she could not forgive
I walked out to the graveyard
Down by the Church of God
I looked upon the one I love
That would soon be covered with sod
Up along the Ohio River
Over on the old Kentucky shore
Now there's a crepe upon her door
The angels took my darling
God needed the one I loved
I reached the old Kentucky shore today
I'll make my plans and meet her up above
The last words that my darling said
Was tell the one I love goodbye
I would like to see him before I go
Traveling down this long lonesome highway
I'm so lonesome I could cry
Memories of how we once loved each other
On and on I'll follow my darling
And I wonder where she can be
On and on I'll follow my darling
And I wonder if she ever thinks of me.
I've cried I've cried for you little darling
It breaks my heart to hear your name
My friends they also love you my darling
And they think that I am to blame.
I have to follow you my darling
I can't sleep when the sun goes down
By your side is my destination
I'll love you till the day I die
And for no good cause you see
For you know just what you will cause
Don't leave me here to face this lonesome world
He said to the horse you gotta outrun this train
From Buffalo to Washington
Shot down my husband and I've got your gun
McKinley's in the graveyard taking his rest
I took a bite and then I looked to see what I had ate
I found I had a cinder all covered up in white
That old sugar coated love is something I can't bite
You say you are leaving me for another man
He has all the wealth and charm and not my kind of brand
Baby I fell down on my knees a pleading for your love
Can't understand what I saw in a sugar coated love
Said I was your Romeo and you my Juliet
The lonesome sigh of a train going by
Makes me want to stop and cry
I recall the day it took you away
I'm blue I'm lonesome too
When I hear that whistle blow
I want to pack my suitcase and go
The lonesome sound of a train going by
Makes me want to stop and cry
In the still of the night in the pale moonlight
These lonesome blues I just can't lose
I left the one that love in the mountains
And all the love we shared
But each night as she kneels by her bed side
I know she calls my name in her prayer
When the moon shines on the Blue Ridge mountains
And it seems I can hear my sweetheart call
How I long to be near to my darling
When the golden leaves begin to fall
She knows that I'll return to the mountains
And will bring to her a wedding ring
It will be placed upon her finger
Happiness to us both it will bring
Winter time is so cold in the mountains
The ground will soon be covered white with snow
How I long to keep the home fires burning
But another little drink wouldn't do her any harm.
We'd still have winter in the summer time.
So he went up and down like an old saw mill.
I wonder where you are tonight.
And though your love grows even colder
I wonder where you are tonight.
Though you often said you cared.
Someone who knows the love I shared.
And though your love grows even colder
I wonder where you are tonight.
I tried to smile with all my might.
That lingers in my heart tonight.
And though your love grows even colder
I wish to the lord I'd never been born
Or died when I was young
I never would have seen your sparkling blue eyes
Or heard your lying tongue
All the good times are past and gone
All the good times are o'er
All the good times are past and gone
Little darling don't weep no more
Don't you see that turtle dove
That flies from pine to pine
He's mourning for his own true love
Just like I mourn for mine
And stay awhile with me
For if ever I've had a friend in this world
I'm going to that east pay road
I'm going to that east pay road
I'm going to the east
I'm going to the one that I love best
You wouldn't roll so slow
If you knew what I know
I've got a good woman just the same
I've got a good woman just the same
My woman just the same
Says she's gonna change her name
I've got a good woman just the same
You wouldn't roll so slow
If you knew what I know
My home is down in Tennessee
My home is down in Tennessee
That's where I long to be
Way down in sunny Tennessee
You wouldn't roll so slow
If you knew what I know
Blue night I got you on my mind
Blue night I can't keep from crying
You met someone that was new
You quit someone that you knew was true
Blue night I got you on my mind
Blue night blue as I can be
Where we used to walk I walk alone
With an aching heart because my love is gone
Blue night blue as I can be
I used to call you on the telephone
I used to call and it made you glad
Now I call and it makes you mad
Blue night all by myself
Since you put me on that shelf
There's just one thing that you must know
You're gonna reap just what you sow
My solitary watch I'd keep
And think of her I'd left behind
And ask if she'd be true and kind
I never shall forget the day
That I was forced to go away
In silence there my head she'd rest
And held me to her loving breast
Oh Willy don't go back to sea
There's other girls as good as me
But none can love you true as I
Pray don't go where the bullets fly
The deep deep sea may us divide
And I may be some other's bride
But still my thoughts will oft times stray
To be with thou so far away
I never have proved false to thee
The love I gave was true and kind
But you have proved untrue to me
I can no longer call thee mine
My home upon some icy lake
Where the southern sun refused to shine
Although I know that it will be so hard to do.
Brings the dusty silver
And my blue moon again will turn to gold.
You'll be back within my arms to stay.
Your kisses were meant for only me.
But my golden moon is just a memory.
You'll be back within my arms to stay.
Were the sweetest stories ever told.
And my blue moon again will turn to gold.
Shining down on me so I can see
I must learn His ways so I'll never stray
Let the light shine down on me
Let the light shine down
Let the light shine down
Let the light shine down so I can see
There's a lesson I must learn
There's some bridges I must burn
Let the light shine down on me
Those that follow Him eternal life shall win
He died to set us free
If you trust and believe his blessing you'll receive
Let the light shine down on me
Let the light shine down
Let the light shine down
Let the light shine down so I can see
There's a lesson I must learn
There's some bridges I must burn
Let the light shine down on me
I have heard folks say that there will come a day
When He'll drag all the rocks to fall
The worlds in darkness bounds in the light somehow
Let the light shine down on us all
Let the light shine down
Let the light shine down
Let the light shine down so I can see
There's a lesson I must learn
There's some bridges I must burn
Why don't you stop at one and join the foll and ask the Lord to protect your soul.
When this old world is doomed in sin you'll cry oh Lord please let me in but it'll be to late to make your goal
Here the labor is so hard and the workers are tired
And our weary hearts are longing for a rest
And we find we're getting anxious to be in that happy land
Where we'll enjoy some peace and happiness
For our weary hearts grow heavy with each day
The family's scattered here and there but Lord we love them dear
And maybe we can help them find the way
Well if waiting is the cost well they might not be lost
But wait a little longer please Jesus
Just a little longer please Jesus
In the land where we shall never shall die
The Savior has paid a great price for me
He gave His life on Calvary
So I'll follow his footsteps up the narrow way
And be ready to meet Him when He calls on that day
That we would be saved from sin and not lost
So I'll follow His footsteps up the narrow way
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
If I was a drunkard I tell you what I would do
I'd quit my drinking and I'd work on the building too
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
If I was a preacher I tell you what I would do
I would keep on preaching and work on the building too
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
You have no doubt in your mind
There's a heaven up above
And you mean to change before the end
But you hold onto treasures
You possessed here on earth
Feasting your soul on sin
Don't put off till tomorrow what you can do today
For tomorrow may be too late
Sinner give your heart to Jesus won't you kneel down and pray
For tomorrow may be too late
You say you'll change tomorrow
But tomorrow never comes
These words you keep repeating everyday
How sad will be the story
When you're laid in your grave
In torment forever you will pay
There's a wreck on the highway
There's blood on the road
That lifeless body lies cold
They'll never know Jesus
They've waited too long
There's a call that rings from the throne it springs
To those now gone astray
Many do not heed that the chains of greed
That their conscience never tire
Be assured my friend if you still offend
He will set your fields on fire
Now if you don't from sin retire
He will set your fields on fire
And in death your soul must fall
Now my friend if you desire
You may join the heavenly choir
And rejoice with him free from every sin
When He sets this world on fire
You have heard his voice seen His soul rejoice
That trusted in his grace
You have blushed with sin as He knocked within
But still you hide your face
From the blessed Lord and His own true word
But still you say retire
Leave the downward path kindle not His wrath
Get down... get down... get down... get down...
You better get down on your knees and pray.
And I'll be ready when he calls my name
So happy I'll be on my way to Heaven
I hear the Angels freely say
Oh the boat of love down at the harbor
It's waiting there for you and me
I have no fear Christ is the captain
Let's get on board that great excursion
And sail the sea to the home above
Don't wait too late to make your reservation
It's the boat of God's eternal love
Oh the boat of love will soon be sailing
Don't wait too late to make your reservation
I'll meet you there at the break of day
Jesus lifted a cross upon his shoulder
I'll meet you there at the first cross over
Oh the river of death lies just before me
Can I find a place that I can cross
Or will I be in sin forever
Oh Lord don't let my soul be lost
Oh I wanna walk with Christ my savior
For he's the one that'll guide me on
All through my life I've been a sinner
Oh I can hear my savior calling
To me his voice sounds sweet and low
For me I hear my loved ones cheering
My life down here will soon be over
And this old world holds nothing for me
He saved my soul and He made me happy
The day's are so lonely the night are so long
Our home is a prison since you are gone
And I'll always wonder why our love didn't last
With no hope for tomorrow I'll live in the past
A door that won't knock a phone that don't ring
The postman goes by and he don't leave a thing
A pain in my heart and tears in my eyes
My sweetheart has gone I'm left here to cry
I'm the biggest pretender you ever could see
I pretend you still love me false love couldn't be
And then I remember and I know that its true
For you're with another and I know I've lost you
I'll just go on dreaming sweet dreams of the past
Of when you still love me and I thought it would last
But life is so short and time moves so fast
I got a gal at the head of the creek
Girls up on Cripple Creek about half grown
Jump on a man like a dog on a bone
I'll roll my britches up to my knees
That the man who ran looked a lot like me
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave while the night winds wail
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave while the night winds wail
The scaffold was high and eternity near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave while the night winds wail
I'm growing old and feeble and I can't work on more
My rusty bladed hoe I've laid to rest
My mama and my papa they are sleeping side by side
And their spirits now are roaming with the blessed
Letting in the sunshine and the rain
And the only friend I've got now is that good old dog of mine
And that little old log cabin in the lane
Oh the paths have all grown up that led around the hill
The fences have all gone to decay
And the creeks have all dried up where we used to go to mill
And things have changed their course another way
I want to rest content while I remain
I'm begging to you and I want to go with you
You're breaking my heart as you say goodbye
I hope and I pray we'll soon be together
My heart is so full it's hard not to cry
What will I do when the leaves start falling
The far distant hill will make me feel blue
Your sweet ruby lips and hair like an angel
But to know that you're mine it makes life worth living
I'm trusting in you but each hour seems longer
I'm counting the days when I'll be with you
The stars up in the sky remind me of your eyes
And the way they use to gaze into mine
The moon up above brings back memories of love
I thought was true and so divine
Never again will I knock upon your door
Never again but these words I can say
I'll try not to love and stay out of your way
We had the greatest start but deep within your heart
You led me on before I knew the score
You cheated and you lied I stayed right by your side
Good morning captain good morning son
Do you need another mule skinner
Out on your new road line
Well I like to work I'm rolling all the time
Lord I like to work boy I'm rolling all the time
I can pop my initials Right on a mule's behind
And if you don't like your job just set that water bucket down
I work out on the new road from a dollar and a dime a day
Lord I work out on the new road I make a dollar and a dime a day
I've got three women on Saturday night Waiting to draw my pay
Well I'm going to town honey what can I bring you back
Well I'm going to town baby what can I bring you back
Lord it's raining here and it's storming on the deep blue sea
Lord it's raining here and it's storming on the deep blue sea
Just throw your good gal out the window let your house just burn on down
Well I'm leaving here and I ain't gonna take no clothes
I'm leaving here and I ain't gonna take no clothes
I tried to tell you how I loved you
And I tried to tell you night and day
But when I'm gone no more to see you
Honey you won't be satisfied that way
I'll leave you now if you don't want me
I'll leave you anytime you say
But when I'm gone no more to see you
Honey you won't be satisfied that way
I'll leave you now if you don't want me
I'll leave you anytime you say
But when I'm gone no more to see you
Honey you won't be satisfied that way
I tried to tell you how I loved you
And I tried to tell you night and day
But when I'm gone no more to see you
Honey you won't be satisfied that way
I'll leave you now if you don't want me
I'll leave you anytime you say
But when I'm gone no more to see you
Oh the people would come from far away
They'd dance all night till the break of day
You knew Uncle Pen was ready to go
Late in the evening about sundown
High on the hill and above the town
Uncle Pen played the fiddle lord how it would ring
To me that's where the fiddle begins
I'll never forget that mournful day
When Uncle Pen was called away
Shine on the one whose gone and proved untrue
Shine on the one whose gone and left me blue
It was on a moonlit night
The stars were shining bright
They whispered from on high
Your love has said goodbye
High on the mountain what do you see
You better get your rifles boys before it's too late
He's big around the middle and he's broad across the rump
He never been caught and he ain't never been treed some folks say looks a lot like me
I saved up my money and I bought me some bees
I chopped down the tree but my honey's all gone
Ole Slew Foot's done made himself at home
He's big around the middle...
We'll chase him in the gully and we'll run him in the well
And shoot him at the bottom and we'll listen to him yell
Who makes me forget all the other girls I've met
Sweet little miss blue eyes
Who's sweeter to me that she really ought to be
Sweet little miss blue eyes
Little miss blue eyes looks so good
I'm gonna bring her to the neighborhood
I'm gonna make every girl in town
Jealous when she's around
With sweet little miss blue eyes
With sweet little miss blue eyes
Little miss blue eyes looks so good
I'm gonna bring her to the neighborhood
I'm gonna make every girl in town
Jealous when she's around
With sweet little miss blue eyes
I want to be with you I can give you love that's true
Just believe the way I feel I love you and I always will
No one could take your place with me
Don't ever think of setting me free
Just believe the way I feel I love you and I always will
Just believe the way I feel I love you and I always will
I'll spend a lifetime loving you
Just believe the way I feel I love you and I always will
I think of you each day and night
I just want to hold you tight
Just believe the way I feel I love you and I always will
I wish I knew how it would feel to be free
I wish I could break all the chains holding me
I wish I could say all the things that I should say
For the whole round world to hear.
I wish I could share all the love that's in my heart
Remove all the bars that keep us apart
I wish you could know what it means to be me
Then you'd see and agree
That every man should be free.
I wish I could give all I'm longing to give
I wish I could live like I'm longing to live
I wish that I could do all the things that I can do
Though I'm way overdue I'd be starting anew.
Well I wish I could be like a bird in the sky
How sweet it would be if I found I could fly
Oh I'd soar to the sun and look down at the sea
I'd know how it feels to be free
I'd know how it feels to be free
As you read this letter that I write to you
Sweetheart I hope you understand
That you're the only love I knew
Please forgive me if you can
Sweetheart I beg you to come home tonight
I'm so blue and all alone
I promise that I'll treat you right
And the fire is burning low
The snow has covered up the ground
No sun is shining in my world
All my laughter's turned to tears
Every pretty flower has turned to brown
They all look like me with their head tied down
My heart only sing the sadness song
And my blue moon again will turn to gold.
You'll be back within my arms to stay.
Your kisses were meant for only me.
But my golden moon is just a memory.
You'll be back within my arms to stay.
Were the sweetest stories ever told.
And my blue moon again will turn to gold.
I was born in the south land
Twenty some odd years ago
I ran away for the first time
When I was three years old
My home is on my back
I know every inch of highway
Every mile of railroad track
Well I got this old guitar
Well I carry it in an old tote sack
Well I hawked it about a hundred times
But I always get it back
My home is on my back
I know every inch of highway
Every mile of railroad track
Well you may not like my appearance
Well you may not like the way I talk
But you like the way I'm gone
My home is on my back
I know every inch of highway
You have heard and read about the state of Tennessee.
Down in the southern states is where I want to be.
Where the valleys are so green and mountains are so tall.
The home of Davy Crockett in the hills of Tennessee.
When I was a little boy around the folks back home.
Now that I have gone away my heart is full of woe.
The home of Davy Crockett in the hills of Tennessee.
If ever I get back to that state of Tennessee.
I tell you there'll be no more roaming for me.
There lives a sweetheart who said she'd marry me.
As soon as I get back to that state of Tennessee.
Gonna lay around the track
Till the mail train comes back
Now where was you last Friday night
Wouldn't even go my bail
Gonna lay around the track
Till the mail train comes back
Grandma's a gingerbread maker
Mama can weave and can spin
Just watches that money roll in
Gonna lay around the track
Till the mail train comes back
I know that your parents don't like me
They drove me away from your door
If I had my life to live over
Gonna lay around the track
Till the mail train comes back
And up through the ground came a bubbling crude
Said that California was the place he ought to be
So he loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly
They would like to thank you folks for kindly dropping in
You're all invited back again to this locality
To have a heaping helping of their hospitality
I'm going to that east pay road
I'm going to that east pay road
I'm going to the east
I'm going to the one that I love best
You wouldn't roll so slow
If you knew what I know
I've got a good woman just the same
I've got a good woman just the same
My woman just the same
Says she's gonna change her name
I've got a good woman just the same
You wouldn't roll so slow
If you knew what I know
My home is down in Tennessee
My home is down in Tennessee
That's where I long to be
Way down in sunny Tennessee
You wouldn't roll so slow
If you knew what I know
I wonder where you are tonight.
And though your love grows even colder
I wonder where you are tonight.
Though you often said you cared.
Someone who knows the love I shared.
And though your love grows even colder
I wonder where you are tonight.
I tried to smile with all my might.
That lingers in my heart tonight.
And though your love grows even colder
It's the orange blossom special
Ring the bell Bill ring the bell
Hey Bill where ya gonna get off this train at
Down at about Atlanta Georgia
Down at Nashville Tennessee
And my love belongs to you
All I ask of you my darling
Is love me good and be true
Days come and go and I still love you
And I see your smiling face
And no one's gonna take my place
And my love belongs to you
All I ask of you my darling
Is love me good and be true
And I want to hear you say
You don't belong to another
And in my arms you're gonna to stay
And my love belongs to you
All I ask of you my darling
Is love me good and be true
And my love belongs to you
All I ask of you my darling
Is love me good and be true
Is love me good and be true
You say you're sorry once again dear
You want me to take you back once more
You say you need a helping hand dear
But that's what you told me once before
Walk softly on this heart of mine love
Don't treat it mean and so unkind
Let it rest in peace and quiet love
Walk softly on this heart of mine
I know you soon will find a new love
I feel your heart is turned to stone
But please let me down real easy
Carrying the one that I love
But her soul has been called up above
And she promised she would always love me
Tomorrow as the sun sinks low
The shadows will cover her face
John Henry was a little colored boy
You could hold him on the palm of your hand
And his papa cried out this lonesome farewell
John Henry went upon the mountain
Looked down on the other side
John Henry was so small
He laid down his hammer and he cried
John Henry told his captain
Now fix me a pallet of straw to lay down
I went downtown thought I had a dime
Got home this morning didn't have a dime
Come home this morning about half past eight
She said honey you're out too late
I went in the house to start the fire
She kicked me out in the middle of the night
I fell in the yard mad as I can be
Said to my dog make room for me
Tonight I'm alone without you my dear
It seems there's a longing for you still
All I have to do now is sit alone and cry
In our little cabin home on the hill
And left me here all alone
Just to listen to the rain beat on my window pane
In our little cabin home on the hill
I hope you are happy tonight as you are
But in my heart there's a longing for you still
I just keep it there so I won't be alone
In our little cabin home on the hill
Now when you have come to the end of the way
And find there's no more happiness for you
Just let you thoughts turn back once more if you will
It's the orange blossom special
Ring the bell Bill ring the bell
Hey Bill where ya gonna get off this train at
Down at about Atlanta Georgia
Down at Nashville Tennessee
Oh yonder stands little Maggie
With a dram glass in her hands
She's drinking away her troubles
Oh how can I ever stand it
Just to see them two blue eyes
Like two diamonds in the sky
Last time a saw little Maggie
And a banjo on her knee
Lay down your last gold dollar
Lay down your gold watch and chain
Little Maggie's gonna dance for daddy
Listen to that old banjo ring
Pretty flowers were made for blooming
Pretty stars were made to shine
Shine on the one whose gone and proved untrue
Shine on the one whose gone and left me blue
It was on a moonlit night
The stars were shining bright
They whispered from on high
Your love has said goodbye
Another man has got my woman and gone
My gal went away and left me she left me with the dog gone blues
You'll never miss your water till the well runs dry
You'll never miss your water till the well runs dry
You'll never miss your woman until she says goodbye
I wish to the Lord you'd bring my woman back home
I wish to the Lord you'd bring my woman back home
Our darling wandered far away while she was out at play
Lost in the woods she couldn't hear a sound
She was our darling girl the sweetest thing in all the world
We searched for her but she couldn't be found
I heard the screams of out little girl far away
Hurry Daddy there's and awful dreadful snake
I ran as fast as I could through the dark and dreary woods
But I reached our darling girl too late
Oh I began to cry I knew that soon she'd have to die
For the snake was warning me close by
I held her close to my face she said daddy kill that snake
It's getting dark tell mommy goodbye
To all parents I must say don't let your children stray away
They need your love to guide them along
Oh God I pray we'll see our darling girl some day
When you live in the country
Everybody is your neighbor
On this one thing you can rely
They'll all come to see you
And right after dinner
They ain't looking any thinner
And here's what you hear them say
They'd come to the kitchen
And help do the dishes right away
You can still hear Grandma say
I hate to see the sun sink low
Just for a cause you ought to know
For it's true love I can't forget
All of my sorrow you'll soon regret
You promised me love that was true
And I'm sorry to say that I believed in you
It's all turned out just like a dream
Left me so sad in the world it seems
There's dishes to wash and a house to clean
There's a million words I can't explain
They'll go away and leave you at home
They never care if you're alone
They seem to forget they've got a wife
I'm traveling down this lonesome road oh how I hate to go
The wind and storms are raging high and it's awful cold
My mind drifts back to you sweetheart and I love you so
Now you've gone and left me here to travel this lonesome road
I remember dear not long ago you said you'd be my own
I never thought you'd go away and leave me all alone
The kind of love you had for me I find sweetheart grows cold
For now you've gone and left me here to travel this lonesome road
All I do is roam around and look for you my dear
I know I'll search ten thousand miles oh how I need you here
You broke my heart you left me here now I'm growing old
We were waltzing that night in Kentucky
And I was the boy who was lucky
But it all ended too soon
As I sit here alone in the moonlight
I can see your smiling face
And I long once more for your embrace
With no one to help me along on my way
I can never astray for Jesus leads the way
And I knew that the time would come to me that He'd speak
I can never astray for Jesus leads the way
He will help and protect me to the end of the way
My journey soon will be over and I'll join a happy band
I can never astray for Jesus leads the way
Just patiently waiting for Jesus to come
The birds will be singing while Mother is sleeping
They will sing o'er as the grave sinks away
Well I left my old home way back in the mountains
For mother and father had both passed away
We followed our mother up to the graveyard
For mother was called to heaven that day
Oh how we miss her around the old home place
Everything seems so lonesome since she went away
Mother is sleeping way back the mountains
The days are long the nights are lonely
Since you left me all alone
I worried so my little darling
I worried so since you've been gone
Sweetheart of mine can't you hear me calling
A million times that I love you best
Come back to me is my request
I remember dear the night we parted
A big mistake had caused it all
If you come back sunshine will follow
If you stay away twill be my fall
The nights are long my little darling
Oh how I need your sweet embrace
When I awoke the sun was shining
My heart is so lonely and blue
When friends ask about you why you're not around
How will I explain about you
How will I explain about you
They know I've been faithful and true
So when they start asking why you're not around
How will I explain about you
They saw us together for such a long time
They knew that I loved you so true
But now that you've gone and I'm left all alone
How will I explain about you
How will I explain about you
I can't let them know that we're through
They wouldn't believe it could ever be true
How will I explain about you
How will I explain about you
I'm leaving it all up to you
And if you insist that our pathway must part
Oh my brother take this warning
You'll be lost in sin forever
You'll never reach the promised land
The old crossroads now is waiting
Which one are you going to take
One leads down to destruction
The other to the pearly gate
One road leads up to heaven
The other goes down below
Jesus our savior will protect you
He'll guide you through the old crossroads
Soon your life will be over
You'll have to face the old crossroads
Will you be ready then my brother
I weeped and moaned over his grave and to me boys it was sad
My best pal was my old paint horse and now he's gone to rest
I laid him down beneath that mound in Texas away out West
Where the cactus blooms over his grave and the coyotes cry
I know he sleeps in perfect peace beneath the Texas sky
Dear old pal it breaks my heart to leave you here alone
Now I'll go and ride the range on the Texas roan
But my love for you old pal it shall linger on
When we were young and we thought we loved each other
But you didn't love me I guess
For you've gone and you've found another
Everything to you is regret
This morning along about daybreak
You quarreled at me the whole night through
I know it's not too late for your sake dear
But for me I will always be blue
Oh I'm weary my darling weary
Just to know your love's gone cold
For without you life will be so dreary
We'll need each other when we grow old
Oh sweetheart be good to our babies
And I want you to teach them to pray
Tell them to say a little prayer for their daddy
I was lost in sin so long with no one to guide my way
My soul was in darkness had been for many a day
In that little community church house I heard that gospel song
I went inside to kneel and pray
That He might hear and would accept me
And then I felt the holy spirit
I knew my soul was saved in me
In that little community church house that's where we sang and prayed
We prayed to our Father to guide us on our way
All through life's long journey we'll need His helping hand
Until we reach that promised land
In that little community church house among my many friends
I can hear them praying for me and the preacher said amen
And the vision there before me it was my Savior's face
Shine on the one whose gone and proved untrue
Shine on the one whose gone and left me blue
It was on a moonlit night
The stars were shining bright
They whispered from on high
Your love has said goodbye
We were waltzing that night in Kentucky
And I was the boy who was lucky
But it all ended too soon
As I sit here alone in the moonlight
I can see your smiling face
And I long once more for your embrace
She bloomed for me near a little village
In a cabin on the hill
We made our vows we'd love each other
And I know we always will
She's my rose of old Kentucky
I watched her bloom as the years roll by
And to me there'll never be another
Oh in dreams I see my darling
In a gingham dress she looks so sweet
Oh I long for old Kentucky
And my darling was more to me
Oh I know you often wonder
So I'll tell you the reason why
She's my rose of old Kentucky
Carrying the one that I love
But her soul has been called up above
And she promised she would always love me
Tomorrow as the sun sinks low
The shadows will cover her face
It's mighty dark for me to travel
For my sweetheart she is gone
The road is rough and filled with gravel
But I must journey on and on
To me she was a little angel
Sent down to me from God above
And on the day that I first met her
Then I told her of my love
Many a night we strolled together
Talking of our love so fair
My love for her will never vanish
Oh I know I'll meet her there
Traveling down this lonesome highway
Thinking of my love who's gone
Knowing soon we'll be together
Oh my brother take this warning
You'll be lost in sin forever
You'll never reach the promised land
The old crossroads now is waiting
Which one are you going to take
One leads down to destruction
The other to the pearly gate
One road leads up to heaven
The other goes down below
Jesus our savior will protect you
He'll guide you through the old crossroads
Soon your life will be over
You'll have to face the old crossroads
Will you be ready then my brother
And Autumn leaves have turned to brown
My heart is sad my soul is weary
The clouds are dark the day is dreary
It seems all earthly help is vain
Angels rock me to sleep in the cradle of love
Bear me over the deep to heaven above
When the shadows shall fall and the savior shall call
Angels rock me to sleep in the cradle of love
There is no earthly friend to guide me
No one to call to heaven's goal
But Christ the savior stands beside me
To cheer and comfort my poor soul
At last the harbor I am nearing
I see the lights along the shore
I hear my friends and loved ones cheering
I've been looking around
There's a whole new world I see
And so many things that I can do
With your strength in me
Now I ask you to hear
As I sing of brighter days
For I need to have you very near
Come and find the way
I will soar into the sky
To hold a brother's hand
Let me see what I can find
You've been watching me grow
As you gently lead me on
It's your love and power that I know
Guides and keeps me strong
Now I ask you to hear
As I sing of brighter days
For I need to have you very near
Come and find the way
I will soar into the sky
To hold a brother's hand
Let me see what I can find
High above the clouds
I can see the beauty down below
And I know you're holding me
I will soar into the sky
To hold a brother's hand
Let me see what I can find
Give me to reach the sky
Moving up I'm rising high
Do you need another mule skinner
With a blacksnake whip to toss
I've got a good woman
I can make any mule listen
Or I won't accept no pay
He run all around Memphis he beat the Memphis train
Beat the Memphis train O Lord beat the Memphis train
Fever in my head O Lord fever in my head
Out in California where Molly done as she pleased
Come back to old Kentucky got beat with all ease
Beat with all ease O Lord beat with all ease
Clear out of sight O Lord clear out of sight
We're gonna bury old Molly in a coffin ready made
Now some folks like the summertime when the they can walk about
Strolling through the meadow green it's pleasant there no doubt
But give me the wintertime when the snow is on the ground
For I found her when the snow on the ground
I traced her little footprints in the snow
I found her little footprints in the snow
I bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way
For I found her when the snow was on the ground
I dropped in to see her there was a big round moon
Her mother said she just stepped out but would be returning soon
I found her little footprints and I traced them in the snow
I found her when the snow was on the ground
Now she's up in heaven she's with the angel band
I know I'm going to meet her in that promised land
But every time the snow falls it brings back memories
Sitting alone in the moonlight
Thinking of the days gone by
Wondering about my darling
I can still hear her saying goodbye
Oh the moon grows pale as I sit here
Each little star seems to whisper and say
Your sweetheart has found another
As I travel down life's pathway
Knowing not what the years may hold
As I ponder hopes grow fonder
Precious memories flood my soul
Precious Memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious father loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes from my childhood
I'm just a used to be to you
Tomorrow be another lonesome day
And I know you'll want me far away
I'm just a used to be to you
Tomorrow be another lonesome day
And I know you'll want me far away
And my love belongs to you
All I ask of you my darling
Is love me good and be true
Days come and go and I still love you
And I see your smiling face
And no one's gonna take my place
And my love belongs to you
All I ask of you my darling
Is love me good and be true
And I want to hear you say
You don't belong to another
And in my arms you're gonna to stay
And my love belongs to you
All I ask of you my darling
Is love me good and be true
And my love belongs to you
All I ask of you my darling
Is love me good and be true
Is love me good and be true
The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia line
The engine passed at six o'clock
And the cab passed by at nine
Where the sun never shines
And we shiver when the cold wind blows
I asked my captain for the time of day
A long steel rail and a short cross tie
I'm on my way back home
That makes you treat me so
You caused me to leave my home
My father was an engineer
Died a mile out of town
His head was found in the driving gear
As you read this letter that I write to you
Sweetheart I hope you understand
That you're the only love I knew
Please forgive me if you can
Sweetheart I beg you to come home tonight
I'm so blue and all alone
I promise that I'll treat you right
And the fire is burning low
The snow has covered up the ground
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
If I was a drunkard I tell you what I would do
I'd quit my drinking and I'd work on the building too
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
If I was a preacher I tell you what I would do
I would keep on preaching and work on the building too
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
He run all around Memphis he beat the Memphis train
Beat the Memphis train O Lord beat the Memphis train
Fever in my head O Lord fever in my head
Out in California where Molly done as she pleased
Come back to old Kentucky got beat with all ease
Beat with all ease O Lord beat with all ease
Clear out of sight O Lord clear out of sight
We're gonna bury old Molly in a coffin ready made
Shine on the one whose gone and proved untrue
Shine on the one whose gone and left me blue
It was on a moonlit night
The stars were shining bright
They whispered from on high
Your love has said goodbye
I'm traveling down this lonesome road oh how I hate to go
The wind and storms are raging high and it's awful cold
My mind drifts back to you sweetheart and I love you so
Now you've gone and left me here to travel this lonesome road
I remember dear not long ago you said you'd be my own
I never thought you'd go away and leave me all alone
The kind of love you had for me I find sweetheart grows cold
For now you've gone and left me here to travel this lonesome road
All I do is roam around and look for you my dear
I know I'll search ten thousand miles oh how I need you here
You broke my heart you left me here now I'm growing old
It's mighty dark for me to travel
For my sweetheart she is gone
The road is rough and filled with gravel
But I must journey on and on
To me she was a little angel
Sent down to me from God above
And on the day that I first met her
Then I told her of my love
Many a night we strolled together
Talking of our love so fair
My love for her will never vanish
Oh I know I'll meet her there
Traveling down this lonesome highway
Thinking of my love who's gone
Knowing soon we'll be together
She bloomed for me near a little village
In a cabin on the hill
We made our vows we'd love each other
And I know we always will
She's my rose of old Kentucky
I watched her bloom as the years roll by
And to me there'll never be another
Oh in dreams I see my darling
In a gingham dress she looks so sweet
Oh I long for old Kentucky
And my darling was more to me
Oh I know you often wonder
So I'll tell you the reason why
She's my rose of old Kentucky
In this awful world of sorrow
On this wicked path of sin
Never thinking of tomorrow
Or what I'd lose in the end
I can hear my savior calling
Wash away your sins forever
And you shall rest eternally
Now I'm safe with my Jesus
He will guide me on my way
I will sing His praise forever
Another man has got my woman and gone
My gal went away and left me she left me with the dog gone blues
You'll never miss your water till the well runs dry
You'll never miss your water till the well runs dry
You'll never miss your woman until she says goodbye
I wish to the Lord you'd bring my woman back home
I wish to the Lord you'd bring my woman back home
One night while out for a ramble
The hour was just about nine
I met a young maiden in Frisco
On the corner of Geary and Pine
On her face there was beauty of nature
And her eyes just seemed to expand
Her hair was so rich and so brilliant
Entwined in a blue velvet band
We strolled down the street together
In my pocket she placed her small hand
She planted the evidence on me
The girl in the blue velvet band
I heard the scream of the siren
And the girl in the blue velvet band
She left me to face all the trouble
With a diamond that was worth ten grand
They sent me to San Quentin for stealing
God knows I'm an innocent man
The girl in the blue velvet band
Standing there close to the bars
I fancied I heard a voice calling
Far out in the ocean of stars
I'll be out in a year and I'm leaving
But I'll carry the name of a man
That served ten years in prison
For the girl in the blue velvet band
And when I get out I'll endeavor
To live in some other land
And I'll bid farewell to old Frisco
Tonight I'm alone without you my dear
It seems there's a longing for you still
All I have to do now is sit alone and cry
In our little cabin home on the hill
And left me here all alone
Just to listen to the rain beat on my window pane
In our little cabin home on the hill
I hope you are happy tonight as you are
But in my heart there's a longing for you still
I just keep it there so I won't be alone
In our little cabin home on the hill
Now when you have come to the end of the way
And find there's no more happiness for you
Just let you thoughts turn back once more if you will
Now some folks like the summertime when the they can walk about
Strolling through the meadow green it's pleasant there no doubt
But give me the wintertime when the snow is on the ground
For I found her when the snow on the ground
I traced her little footprints in the snow
I found her little footprints in the snow
I bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way
For I found her when the snow was on the ground
I dropped in to see her there was a big round moon
Her mother said she just stepped out but would be returning soon
I found her little footprints and I traced them in the snow
I found her when the snow was on the ground
Now she's up in heaven she's with the angel band
I know I'm going to meet her in that promised land
But every time the snow falls it brings back memories
Now will you love me little darling
And you know I can't be with you
Will you be loving another man
Will you be loving another man
When I return will you be waiting
Or will you be loving another man
Now don't be crying on my shoulder
And telling me that love is grand
And before I'm out of sight dear
Then be loving another man
Now if I find this to be true dear
I want you to please understand
When I return don't say you're sorry
The days are long the nights are lonely
Since you left me all alone
I worried so my little darling
I worried so since you've been gone
Sweetheart of mine can't you hear me calling
A million times that I love you best
Come back to me is my request
I remember dear the night we parted
A big mistake had caused it all
If you come back sunshine will follow
If you stay away twill be my fall
The nights are long my little darling
Oh how I need your sweet embrace
When I awoke the sun was shining
Our little girl taken sick one evening
As she walked home from school
And in her death bed soon bring her
It made us so sad and so blue
Then she called me close to her bedside
I hear a sweet voice calling
Way up in heaven on high
Oh Mommy and Daddy don't cry
Take care of my little brother
Tell him I've gone to rest
I know his little heart is broken
He's all that you have left
Then she closed her eyes forever
Never to see us no more
Until we meet our darling
Do you need another mule skinner
With a blacksnake whip to toss
I've got a good woman
I can make any mule listen
Or I won't accept no pay
Now come and listen to my story
My story that I know is true
A little rose bloomed in Georgia
With marigold and a heart of gold
Way down in the Blue Ridge mountains
Way down where the tall pines grow
There's my sweetheart of the mountain
She's my little Georgia rose
My mother left her with another
A carefree life she had planned
The baby now is a lady
The one her mother couldn't stand
Way down in the Blue Ridge mountains
Way down where the tall pines grow
There's my sweetheart of the mountain
She's my little Georgia rose
We often sang old songs together
I watched her do her little part
She smiled at me when I would tell her
That she was my sweetheart
Way down in the Blue Ridge mountains
Way down where the tall pines grow
There's my sweetheart of the mountain
I'll love you till the day I die
And for no good cause you see
For you know just what you will cause
Don't leave me here to face this lonesome world
Back in the days of my childhood
In the evening when everything was still
I used to sit and listen to the foxhounds
With my dad in the old Kentucky hills
I'm on my way back to the old home
The road winds on up the hill
But there's no light in the window
That shined long ago where I live
Soon my childhood days were over
I had to leave my old home
For dad and mother were called to heaven
I's left in this world all alone
High in the hills of old Kentucky
Stands the fondest spot in my memory
I'm on my way back to the old home
The lonesome sigh of a train going by
Makes me want to stop and cry
I recall the day it took you away
I'm blue I'm lonesome too
When I hear that whistle blow
I want to pack my suitcase and go
The lonesome sound of a train going by
Makes me want to stop and cry
In the still of the night in the pale moonlight
These lonesome blues I just can't lose
Let's all kneel down at the altar
And pray that our souls might be free.
I'll meet you in church Sunday morning
And we'll all kneel down and pray
We'll pray to our Lord up in heaven
To guide us safe home on our way.
It's a place where we all meet on Sunday
To worship our Lord up above
And let all of our sins be forgiven
And meet with our loved ones above.
I'll meet you in church Sunday morning
And we'll all kneel down and pray
We'll pray to our Lord up in heaven
To guide us safe home on our way.
From the land where there's one endless day
Let's all be prepared to meet Jesus
The path is narrow to that home far away.
I'll meet you in church Sunday morning
And we'll all kneel down and pray
We'll pray to our Lord up in heaven
And I'll be ready when he calls my name
So happy I'll be on my way to Heaven
I hear the angels freely say
Let's get on board that great excursion
And sail the sea to the home above
Don't wait too late to make your reservation
It's the boat of God's eternal love
Don't wait too late to make your reservation
Let me tell you a tale about a spry old man
Guess he's as old as the hills
He's the favorite fiddler for miles and miles around
And plays for all the good quadrilles
Every Saturday night all the folks stop in and tune
The whole town is ready to go
While the fellers chose their partners and the caller taps the jug
Oh the people would come from far away
They'd dance all night till the break of day
You knew Uncle Pen was ready to go
Late in the evening about sundown
High on the hill and above the town
Uncle Pen played the fiddle lord how it would ring
To me that's where the fiddle begins
I'll never forget that mournful day
When Uncle Pen was called away
I left the one that love in the mountains
And all the love we shared
But each night as she kneels by her bed side
I know she calls my name in her prayer
When the moon shines on the Blue Ridge mountains
And it seems I can hear my sweetheart call
How I long to be near to my darling
When the golden leaves begin to fall
She knows that I'll return to the mountains
And will bring to her a wedding ring
It will be placed upon her finger
Happiness to us both it will bring
Winter time is so cold in the mountains
The ground will soon be covered white with snow
How I long to keep the home fires burning
Why don't you stop at one and join the foll and ask the Lord to protect your soul.
When this old world is doomed in sin you'll cry oh Lord please let me in but it'll be to late to make your goal
Oh the river of death lies just before me
Can I find a place that I can cross
Or will I be in sin forever
Oh Lord don't let my soul be lost
Oh I wanna walk with Christ my savior
For he's the one that'll guide me on
All through my life I've been a sinner
Oh I can hear my savior calling
To me his voice sounds sweet and low
For me I hear my loved ones cheering
My life down here will soon be over
And this old world holds nothing for me
He saved my soul and He made me happy
I can't answer her letter
For she left me no address
You should know my little darling
You left my poor heart in distress
I got a letter from my darling
She said she hated to go
It broke my heart the words she wrote me
She closed by saying I love you so
She wrote the words she knew would hurt me
She said I never could be true
I've tried I've tried my little darling
To prove my love was just for you
This letter meant goodbye forever
Though we'll have each other's hearts
Our love will fade away in sadness
I walked out to the graveyard
Down by the Church of God
I looked upon the one I love
That would soon be covered with sod
Up along the Ohio River
Over on the old Kentucky shore
Now there's a crepe upon her door
The angels took my darling
God needed the one I loved
I reached the old Kentucky shore today
I'll make my plans and meet her up above
The last words that my darling said
Was tell the one I love goodbye
I would like to see him before I go
I'm just a used to be to you
Tomorrow be another lonesome day
And I know you'll want me far away
I'm just a used to be to you
Tomorrow be another lonesome day
And I know you'll want me far away
For your poison love has stained the life blood
In my heart and soul dear
And I know my life will never be the same
For my pleading has all been in vain
For you and you alone dear
And you know that you are guilty of the same.
Into each life a love is born for one
The love I chose was surely not for me
For your poison love has stained the life blood
In my heart and soul dear
And I know our love was never meant to be.
For your poison love has stained the life blood
In my heart and soul dear
And I know my life will never be the same
For my pleading has all been in vain
For you and you alone dear
And you know that you are guilty of the same.
But still my heart cries out for you
And you alone my darling
It makes me never ever let you go
But my pleading has all been in vain
For your and you alone dear
For your poison love has stained the life blood
In my heart and soul dear
And I know my life will never be the same
For my pleading has all been in vain
For you and you alone dear
We were waltzing that night in Kentucky
And I was the boy who was lucky
But it all ended too soon
As I sit here alone in the moonlight
I can see your smiling face
And I long once more for your embrace
Someone to call me their own.
Please meet me tonight all alone.
It's a story that's never been told.
Leaving my poor darling alone.
And my head on a pillow of stone.
All mounted with silver and gold.
Over these prison walls I would fly.
My heart is sad my soul is weary
The clouds are dark the day is dreary
It seems all earthly help is vain
Angels rock me to sleep in the cradle of love
Bear me over the deep to heaven above
When the shadows shall fall and the savior shall call
Angels rock me to sleep in the cradle of love
There is no earthly friend to guide me
No one to call to heaven's goal
But Christ the savior stands beside me
To cheer and comfort my poor soul
At last the harbor I am nearing
I see the lights along the shore
I hear my friends and loved ones cheering
Any old place I hang my hat is Home Sweet Home to me
Went down to the depot and I looked up on the board
Went down to the depot and I looked up on the board
It read it's good times here but better on down the road
Eat my breakfast here get my dinner in New Orleans
Eat my breakfast here get my dinner in New Orleans
I'm going to get me a Momma
Lord I ain't never seen
Where was you Momma when the train left the shed
Where was you Momma when the train left the shed
The cattle prowled and the coyotes howled
Out on the Great Divide
As down the trail I ride
The rattlesnakes rattle at the prairie dogs
Don't you hear that mournful tune
For it's roundup time away out West
When the cactus are in bloom
Daylight comes and the cowhands yell
I drink my coffee from a can
The sun goes down on the cattle trail
I'm gazing at the moon
For it's roundup time away out West
When the cactus are in bloom
We don't have cold weather
It never snows or rains
That is where the sunshine's best
Out on the western plains
Some of the boys have gone away
But they will be back soon
For it's roundup time away out West
When the cactus are in bloom
Daylight comes and the cowhands yell
I drink my coffee from a can
The sun goes down on the cattle trail
I'm gazing at the moon
For it's roundup time away out West
When the cactus are in bloom
Dear sweetheart as I write to you my heart is filled with pain
For if those things I hear are true I'll never see you again
But if you do I'll tell you true my boat will never land
That in my arms someday you'd be my wife and lovely Queen
I built you that cozy home and made a garden there
And planted too with my own hands sweet flowers rich and fair
Please write and tell me that you're true to the sailor who waits afar
Just tell me that you love me yet still long to be my wife
You made me think of a sweetheart
A little girl that I loved so
After I've wondered the whole night through
My Carolina sunshine girl
You have turned my heart to stone
My Carolina sunshine Girl
You have left me all alone
I wonder why I sit and cry
When I really should laugh
At your little old photograph
For you're the sweetest angel in this world
And I love love love you
Life was so bright and gay everything complete
But I fell for another who led my life astray
So I'll live in sorrow till my dying day
Down the highway of sorrow I'm traveling alone
I've lost all my true friends I've lost a happy home
I'm heading for destruction I'm on the wrong track
Down the highway of sorrow there's no turning back
I went back to my darling I got down on my knees
I begged her with tear rimmed eyes to give my poor heart ease
But she was hurt so deeply she could not forgive
I leave Pittsburgh with a load of steel
Nobody knows just how I feel
With the road up ahead and my baby behind
Lonesome Truck Driver Blues
Lonesome Truck Driver Blues
With the road up ahead and my baby behind
Lonesome truck driver blues
If you load too light you can't make a dime
If you load to heavy then you get a fine
Guess I'd better dump my load
Well it's coffee cakes and pork and beans
Black eyed peas and turnip greens
Turn on my radio one time more
I took a bite and then I looked to see what I had ate
I found I had a cinder all covered up in white
That old sugar coated love is something I can't bite
You say you are leaving me for another man
He has all the wealth and charm and not my kind of brand
Baby I fell down on my knees a pleading for your love
Can't understand what I saw in a sugar coated love
Said I was your Romeo and you my Juliet
All your life you've lived a sinner the bright way you've never trod
You're drifting away you're drifting away
When you come to cross the river and you haven't met with God
You're drifting away you're drifting away
You're drifting away you're drifting away
On down the dark river I'm sorry to say
You're drifting away you're drifting away
Don't wait too long to let Jesus hear you pray
You won't give up your earthly treasures to enter the promised land
You're drifting away you're drifting away
You're drifting away you're drifting away
When you come to the river Jesus don't give thee command
You're drifting away you're drifting away
I'm only a dreamer of romance
My love dreams can never come true
I'll just pretend that I'm happy
And smile through these tears dear at you
I dreamed of a cabin of love dear
Where all of our dreams would come true
But another has taken my cabin
And left me so lonely and blue
Nestled around my cabin
That means all the world to me
Our love sweet heart will always linger
For you are a part dear of me
Where is the love we once cherished
Why didn't our love dreams come true
All I can do now is dream dear
Get down... get down... get down... get down...
You better get down on your knees and pray.
Snowflakes falling my old home is calling
Tall pines are humming Christmas time is coming.
Let it snow and I'll be going back to my country home
Holly's in the window home where the wind blows
Can't walk for running Christmas time is coming.
Home fires burning my heart's yearning
Springtime is near my darling
You say that you are going away
My heart will be with you my darling
And I'm counting now the days
I know that soon I'll have to travel
I know I'm over the hill
I feel so all alone my darling said she'd be gone
When I heard that first whippoorwill
The flowers are blooming little darling
With the budding of the trees
I hear the night birds a crying
I know that they are warning me
Our love was planted little darling
Just like the farmer plants his grain
But there will never be a harvest
The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia line
The engine passed at six o'clock
And the cab passed by at nine
Where the sun never shines
And we shiver when the cold wind blows
I asked my captain for the time of day
A long steel rail and a short cross tie
I'm on my way back home
That makes you treat me so
You caused me to leave my home
My father was an engineer
Died a mile out of town
His head was found in the driving gear
Now some folks like the summertime when the they can walk about
Strolling through the meadow green it's pleasant there no doubt
But give me the wintertime when the snow is on the ground
For I found her when the snow on the ground
I traced her little footprints in the snow
I found her little footprints in the snow
I bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way
For I found her when the snow was on the ground
I dropped in to see her there was a big round moon
Her mother said she just stepped out but would be returning soon
I found her little footprints and I traced them in the snow
I found her when the snow was on the ground
Now she's up in heaven she's with the angel band
I know I'm going to meet her in that promised land
But every time the snow falls it brings back memories
I'll meet you there at the break of day
Jesus lifted a cross upon his shoulder
I'll meet you there at the first cross over
Mother left this world of sorrow
Our home was silent and so sad
Dad took sick and had to leave us
I have no home No mother nor dad
There's a little lonesome grave yard
I often go out to the graveyard
I can almost hear them whisper
Trust in god He'll do the rest
Their souls have gone up to heaven
Where they'll dwell with god above
Where they'll meet there friends and loved ones
Our darling wandered far away while she was out at play
Lost in the woods she couldn't hear a sound
She was our darling girl the sweetest thing in all the world
We searched for her but she couldn't be found
I heard the screams of out little girl far away
Hurry Daddy there's and awful dreadful snake
I ran as fast as I could through the dark and dreary woods
But I reached our darling girl too late
Oh I began to cry I knew that soon she'd have to die
For the snake was warning me close by
I held her close to my face she said daddy kill that snake
It's getting dark tell mommy goodbye
To all parents I must say don't let your children stray away
They need your love to guide them along
Oh God I pray we'll see our darling girl some day
You have no doubt in your mind
There's a heaven up above
And you mean to change before the end
But you hold onto treasures
You possessed here on earth
Feasting your soul on sin
Don't put off till tomorrow what you can do today
For tomorrow may be too late
Sinner give your heart to Jesus won't you kneel down and pray
For tomorrow may be too late
You say you'll change tomorrow
But tomorrow never comes
These words you keep repeating everyday
How sad will be the story
When you're laid in your grave
In torment forever you will pay
There's a wreck on the highway
There's blood on the road
That lifeless body lies cold
They'll never know Jesus
They've waited too long
Sitting alone in the moonlight
Thinking of the days gone by
Wondering about my darling
I can still hear her saying goodbye
Oh the moon grows pale as I sit here
Each little star seems to whisper and say
Your sweetheart has found another
Plant some flowers by my graveside
Just a little bunch of them
Since your hand has planted them
You see my name there on a slab
Won't you stop a little while dear
For I would be lonesome there
You will do this last request
We were waltzing together to a dreamy melody
Now my arms feel so empty as I gaze upon the floor
And I'll keep on changing partners till I hold you once more
Though we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part
In that wonderful moment something happened to my heart
So I'll keep changing partners till you're in my arms and then
When you live in the country
Everybody is your neighbor
On this one thing you can rely
They'll all come to see you
And right after dinner
They ain't looking any thinner
And here's what you hear them say
They'd come to the kitchen
And help do the dishes right away
You can still hear Grandma say
Traveling down this long lonesome highway
I'm so lonesome I could cry
Memories of how we once loved each other
On and on I'll follow my darling
And I wonder where she can be
On and on I'll follow my darling
And I wonder if she ever thinks of me.
I've cried I've cried for you little darling
It breaks my heart to hear your name
My friends they also love you my darling
And they think that I am to blame.
I have to follow you my darling
I can't sleep when the sun goes down
By your side is my destination
Oh you said that you loved me that your heart would be true
I believed in you darling that your heart would be true
Another has my sweetheart and the love that I once knew
I believed in you darling that your heart would be true
But now you've gone and left me I'm so blue
What's happened little darling I don't know
I believed in you darling that your heart would be true
He said to the horse you gotta outrun this train
From Buffalo to Washington
Shot down my husband and I've got your gun
McKinley's in the graveyard taking his rest
I want to thank Jesus for the way that I feel
I'm so full of religion I just can't be still
I want to sing it and shout it and let the people know
That I'm saved by his mercy and I'm ready to go
Yes I'm happy happy on my way
For Jesus is near me and there he will stay
Yes I'm happy happy on my way
I just can't see why you sinners go on
Denying yourself his wonderful love
What a wonderful feeling just to know I am saved
And then he will greet me at heaven's open door
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
If I was a drunkard I tell you what I would do
I'd quit my drinking and I'd work on the building too
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
If I was a preacher I tell you what I would do
I would keep on preaching and work on the building too
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
In the land where we shall never shall die
The Savior has paid a great price for me
He gave His life on Calvary
So I'll follow his footsteps up the narrow way
And be ready to meet Him when He calls on that day
That we would be saved from sin and not lost
So I'll follow His footsteps up the narrow way
There's a call that rings from the throne it springs
To those now gone astray
Many do not heed that the chains of greed
That their conscience never tire
Be assured my friend if you still offend
He will set your fields on fire
Now if you don't from sin retire
He will set your fields on fire
And in death your soul must fall
Now my friend if you desire
You may join the heavenly choir
And rejoice with him free from every sin
When He sets this world on fire
You have heard his voice seen His soul rejoice
That trusted in his grace
You have blushed with sin as He knocked within
But still you hide your face
From the blessed Lord and His own true word
But still you say retire
Leave the downward path kindle not His wrath
Each time I think of you I cry
I press your picture to my bosom
Then I feel that you're close by
Years have passed you've not returned dear
Now they say that you have died
But your soul will live forever
Now I know you'll be close by
I saw you last while you were leaving
The tears from you I tried to hide
You took me in your arms and said dear
Your memory I keep close by
They buried you in a lonely graveyard
And a spot they left beside
There I'll sleep till Jesus calls us
Now come and listen to my story
My story that I know is true
A little rose bloomed in Georgia
With marigold and a heart of gold
Way down in the Blue Ridge mountains
Way down where the tall pines grow
There's my sweetheart of the mountain
She's my little Georgia rose
My mother left her with another
A carefree life she had planned
The baby now is a lady
The one her mother couldn't stand
Way down in the Blue Ridge mountains
Way down where the tall pines grow
There's my sweetheart of the mountain
She's my little Georgia rose
We often sang old songs together
I watched her do her little part
She smiled at me when I would tell her
That she was my sweetheart
Way down in the Blue Ridge mountains
Way down where the tall pines grow
There's my sweetheart of the mountain
For I'm growing very weak
Fall upon my burning cheek
Go and tell my little playmates
That I never more will play
Put my little shoes away
Please remember what I say
Put my little shoes away
Santa Claus he brought them to me
With a lot of other things
And I thought he brought an angel
With a pair of golden wings
Soon the baby will be larger
And they'll fit his little feet
Won't he look so nice and funny
As he walks upon the street
Please remember what I say
Shine on the one whose gone and proved untrue
Shine on the one whose gone and left me blue
It was on a moonlit night
The stars were shining bright
They whispered from on high
Your love has said goodbye
On and on she'll walk this earth
Her face like a beautiful flower
But all alone is a marble stone
You'll find her name written there
Her new voice rings where the angels sing
And if you'll look in the Heavenly book
You'll find her name written there
I'm all alone since the call of fate
Left me in deepest despair
And if you'll wait at the pearly gate
You'll find her name written there
I'll breathe her name into the air
It goes and I know not where
But if you look in the heart of a friend
Here the labor is so hard and the workers are tired
And our weary hearts are longing for a rest
And we find we're getting anxious to be in that happy land
Where we'll enjoy some peace and happiness
For our weary hearts grow heavy with each day
The family's scattered here and there but Lord we love them dear
And maybe we can help them find the way
Well if waiting is the cost well they might not be lost
But wait a little longer please Jesus
Just a little longer please Jesus
Shining down on me so I can see
I must learn His ways so I'll never stray
Let the light shine down on me
Let the light shine down
Let the light shine down
Let the light shine down so I can see
There's a lesson I must learn
There's some bridges I must burn
Let the light shine down on me
Those that follow Him eternal life shall win
He died to set us free
If you trust and believe his blessing you'll receive
Let the light shine down on me
Let the light shine down
Let the light shine down
Let the light shine down so I can see
There's a lesson I must learn
There's some bridges I must burn
Let the light shine down on me
I have heard folks say that there will come a day
When He'll drag all the rocks to fall
The worlds in darkness bounds in the light somehow
Let the light shine down on us all
Let the light shine down
Let the light shine down
Let the light shine down so I can see
There's a lesson I must learn
There's some bridges I must burn
Well you don't love me anymore my darling
I'm just a used to be to you
Those cold cold kisses that you gave me little darling
Proved to me you found somebody new
Tomorrow's just another lonesome day
And I know you'll want me far away
Well you don't love me anymore my darling
I'm just a used to be to you
Gone are the good old days that we spent together
And I don't know if I can stand the pain
Of knowing that you'll soon be gone forever
A star fell from heaven right into my arms
A brighter star I know I've never seen
Then I found out that it was only you with all your charms
Who came into my life to fill a dream
A fallen star is what you are
The twinkle in your eyes came from the sky
You must have strayed from the milky way
A fallen star that's what you are
The heavens must be lonely now that you are mine
I'm sure they'll miss a star as bright as you
But the stars will send there blessing and brighter they will shine
Oh why did you leave me in this lonesome place
With four walls around me and a memory of your face
Why can't I be happy why can't I forget
With four walls around me I wish we'd never met
With four walls around me it gets so lonesome dear
Dreaming of you darling and wishing you were here
Four walls around me my heart is full of pain
Trying to forget you but it's all in vain.
With four walls around you you'll remember how you done me wrong
Your time is coming and I know it won't be long
Till a good woman's love made a new man of me
Till a good woman's love put me back on my feet
And I know that no matter what happens she'll always care
And when night falls and the moon shines above
That's what I'll do If you should leave me with the blues
For me there'll be no moonlight
If ever we should part
My eyes will cry and never dry if you should go
When shadows creep I'll just weep all night I know
You know how much I'd miss you
If ever we should part
It was in the spring one sunny day
My good gal left me Lord she went away
And now she's gone but I don't worry
She called me up from down in El Paso
Show me a woman a man can trust
The woman I'm loving is on the other side
Out in the cold world and far away from home
No one to guide him or keep his footsteps right
Some mother's boy is homeless tonight.
Bring back to me my wandering boy
For there is no other who's left to give me joy
Tell him that his mother with faded cheeks and hair
Is at the old home place awaiting him there
Out in the hallway then stands a vacant chair
And an old pair of shoes he used to wear
Empty is the cradle he used to love so well
Oh how I miss him no tongue can tell.
Well meet up yonder where tears are never shed
There's where I have roamed for many long years
There's where the first step of misfortune I made
It's about thirty years when I courted and married
My brother he stabbed me for some unknown reason
Just three month's later I'd taken Tom's life
I was captured and tried in the village of Kingston
Not a man in that county would speak one kind word
A lifetime in prison was the words that I heard
And sister she sat all alone with a sigh
Toiling and working my poor life away
They'll measure my grave on the banks of old Cumberland
Just as soon as I finish the rest of my days
Boys when you write home from this prison in Nashville
I weeped and moaned over his grave and to me boys it was sad
My best pal was my old paint horse and now he's gone to rest
I laid him down beneath that mound in Texas away out West
Where the cactus blooms over his grave and the coyotes cry
I know he sleeps in perfect peace beneath the Texas sky
Dear old pal it breaks my heart to leave you here alone
Now I'll go and ride the range on the Texas roan
But my love for you old pal it shall linger on
He run all around Memphis he beat the Memphis train
Beat the Memphis train O Lord beat the Memphis train
Fever in my head O Lord fever in my head
Out in California where Molly done as she pleased
Come back to old Kentucky got beat with all ease
Beat with all ease O Lord beat with all ease
Clear out of sight O Lord clear out of sight
We're gonna bury old Molly in a coffin ready made
On a beautiful cloud you see
So you will know that I want you
In my beautiful memories and dreams
Come back to me in my dreams love
Come back to me in sweet dreams
I'm heartbroke I'm sad and I'm weary
Come back to me in my dreams
When the bright moon shines up in Heaven
It seems that you are so near me
But yet it is only a dream
It seems I'll never more see you
Till we meet in Heaven it seems
But I hold you close to my heart love
I got me in bed and covered my head
Wish I was dead with Sally Jo
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
Since you have gone my days are turned to night
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
The hurt you left has just begun to show
Sally Jo I've been so low
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
I'm like a little dog left out to stray
No one wants me no place to stay
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
Did I do bad or was I good to you
The torch I carried had a light so bright
For me to see Sally Jo
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
I'm breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
Don't look at me like you think I've got the blues
I'm just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
Ah ha so I'm talking to myself
Oh no she's not putting me on the shelf
I'm just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
I'm doggone if I'm gonna cry the blues
My feet are sore but I've got no time to lose
I bid farewell to my home so dear
And started down life's road
I was a fortune seeking miner dear
Many things had been my goal
There's many things I've seen in life
I thought I'd like to roam
But I'd give them all and more if I
Could get off this lonesome road
It's a lonesome road to travel on
Many miles of sorrow is all I've know
But I've gone too far to turn back now
From this lonesome lonesome road
I left behind a love that's true
She cried and begged me not to go
But my foolish pride told me what to do
And put me on this lonesome road
Oh such lonely nights I've never found
No time in life before
If she takes me back I'll settle down
I wandered so aimless my heart filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear Savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light
Just like a blind man I wandered alone
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
But I still didn't find it so I must travel on
In the shade of his tree of life that it may ever stand
For I know that I'm not worthy of such splendor as this
When I ask Him for mercy while humbly I stand
I've many dear loved one's who've gone on this way
As I travel down life's pathway
Knowing not what the years may hold
As I ponder hopes grow fonder
Precious memories flood my soul
Precious Memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious father loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes from my childhood
I'll meet you in the morning by the bright riverside
When all sorrow has drifted away
At the close of life's long weary day
I'll meet you in the morning with a how do you do
And we'll sit down by the river and when all the rapture is renewed
You'll know me in the morning by the smile that I wear
When I meet you in the morning In the city that is built four square
I will meet you in the morning in the sweet by and by
And exchange the old cross for a crown
There will be no disappointments and nobody shall die
High on that lonesome road to heaven's blessed abode
For many years I was burdened with care
So often lightening flashed and raging billows dashed
My sorrow then was so heavy to bear
But since my Jesus came I praise his holy name
He sheds the light of his wonderful grace
And every night and day to him I steal away
I found a blessed hiding place
I found a hiding place a blessed hiding place
I said a hiding a blessed hiding place
There's glory in my soul my hallelujah rolls
But since my Jesus came I'm under his control
He keeps me night and day He answers when I pray
And from the raging storm to Him I steal away
Just like a wandering Jew that had no place to choose
But now I've found the way that leads to endless days
No more in darkness I wander alone
When Satan would alarm I climb in God's strong arm
And hide away in his loving embrace
For in the solid rock the blessed solid rock
I am a pilgrim and a stranger
Traveling through this wearisome land
Who have gone to that sweet home
As I go down to that river Jordan
Just to bathe my weary soul
All of my friends all gather round
People steal they cheat and lie
For wealth and what it will buy
But don't they know on judgment day
That gold and silver will melt away
I'd rather be in a dark grave
And to know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul
What good is gold and silver too
If your hearts not pure and true
Sinner hear me when I say
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
Poppa writes to Johnny but Johnny can't come home
Poppa writes to Johnny but Johnny can't come home
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
High sheriff and police riding after me
High sheriff and police riding after me
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
She's the best gal this poor boy ever had
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
Even though we both had to part
Where ever she goes she'll always have my heart
As most people say absence makes the heart grow cold
But the kind of love we had each other's heart will hold
As we travel down two different lonesome roads
For you know you meant the world to me
Crying holy unto the Lord
Crying holy unto the Lord
Stand on the rock where Moses stood
Go and run into the rocks and hide your face
The rocks got no hiding place
Crying holy unto the Lord
Crying holy unto the Lord
Stand on the rock where Moses stood
I've been to the river and I've been baptized
And I ain't no sinner now
Crying holy unto the Lord
Crying holy unto the Lord
Stand on the rock where Moses stood
I've been introduced to the Father and the Son
And I ain't no stranger now
Crying holy unto the Lord
Crying holy unto the Lord
There's coming a time on the great judgment morning
When the Savior will welcome you home
Will you be prepared for the journey to Heaven
On the great ship that carries God's chosen ones home
If you're wandering in sin away from God's teaching
Won't you ask Him to show you the way
Fall down on your knees in a chapel next Sunday
And meet all your friends up in Heaven some day
I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul
It bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above
And just a little talk with Jesus made me whole
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our famished cry
He will answer by and by
Now when you feel a little prayer turning
And you know the little talk with Jesus makes it right
Sometimes my path seems dreary without a ray of cheer
And then the cloud about me hides the light of day
The mists in me rise and hide the stormy skies
But just a little talk with Jesus clears the way
I may have doubts and fears my eyes be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and and night
I go to Him in prayer He knows my every care
And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
All your life you've lived a sinner the bright way you've never trod
You're drifting away you're drifting away
When you come to cross the river and you haven't met with God
You're drifting away you're drifting away
You're drifting away you're drifting away
On down the dark river I'm sorry to say
You're drifting away you're drifting away
Don't wait too long to let Jesus hear you pray
You won't give up your earthly treasures to enter the promised land
You're drifting away you're drifting away
You're drifting away you're drifting away
When you come to the river Jesus don't give thee command
You're drifting away you're drifting away
Can you hear God calling you
His voice is coming down from Heaven
And His word is kind and true.
God is calling you today
If you're not prepared to meet Him
When He comes to take you in
You'll never reach the gates of Heaven
And you'll lose your soul in sin.
God is calling you today
When this life on earth is over
And you reach the Pearly Gate
And weeping my sweet life away.
I'd sail away to the West
I'd sail all around this old wide world
To the one I love the best.
I'm on my way back home.
I'd sail away to the West
I'd sail all around this old wide world
To the one I love the best.
I'd sail away to the West
I'd sail all around this old wide world
To the one I love the best.
Don't do a thing for you.
I'd sail away to the West
I'd sail all around this old wide world
Brother afar from The Savior today
Risking your soul for the things that decay
Oh if today God should call you away
What would you give in exchange for your soul
What would you give in exchange for your soul
Oh if today God should call you away
What would you give in exchange for your soul
Mercy is calling you won't you give heed
Must the Dear Savior still tenderly plead
Risk not your soul it is precious indeed
What would you give in exchange for your soul
What would you give in exchange for your soul
Oh if today God should call you away
What would you give in exchange for your soul
More than all silver and gold of this earth
More than all jewels the spirit is worth
God The Creator has given it birth
What would you give in exchange for your soul
What would you give in exchange for your soul
Oh if today God should call you away
I tried to tell you how I loved you
And I tried to tell you night and day
But when I'm gone no more to see you
Honey you won't be satisfied that way
I'll leave you now if you don't want me
I'll leave you anytime you say
But when I'm gone no more to see you
Honey you won't be satisfied that way
I'll leave you now if you don't want me
I'll leave you anytime you say
But when I'm gone no more to see you
Honey you won't be satisfied that way
I tried to tell you how I loved you
And I tried to tell you night and day
But when I'm gone no more to see you
Honey you won't be satisfied that way
I'll leave you now if you don't want me
I'll leave you anytime you say
But when I'm gone no more to see you
My solitary watch I'd keep
And think of her I'd left behind
And ask if she'd be true and kind
I never shall forget the day
That I was forced to go away
In silence there my head she'd rest
And held me to her loving breast
Oh Willy don't go back to sea
There's other girls as good as me
But none can love you true as I
Pray don't go where the bullets fly
The deep deep sea may us divide
And I may be some other's bride
But still my thoughts will oft times stray
To be with thou so far away
I never have proved false to thee
The love I gave was true and kind
But you have proved untrue to me
I can no longer call thee mine
My home upon some icy lake
Where the southern sun refused to shine
I asked my love to take a walk
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
And only say that you'll be mine
In no other's arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
As into my arms she pressed
And only say that you'll be mine
In no other's arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
Killed the only woman I loved
And only say that you'll be mine
In no other's arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
But another little drink wouldn't do her any harm.
We'd still have winter in the summer time.
So he went up and down like an old saw mill.
I'll love you till the day I die
And for no good cause you see
For you know just what you will cause
Don't leave me here to face this lonesome world
There's a rabbit in the log and I ain't got my dog
How will I get him I know
That way I'll get him I know
That's how I'll get him I know
That way I'll get him I know
I'll build me a fire and I'll cook that old hare
Roll him in the flames and make him brown
Have a feast here tonight while the moon is shining bright
And find me a place to lie down
Find me a place to lie down
Have a feast here tonight while the moon is shining bright
And find me a place to lie down
I'm going down the track and my coat ripped up my back
Soles on my shoes are nearly gone
A little ways ahead there's an old farmer's shed
That's where I'll rest my weary bones
That's where I'll rest my weary bones
A little way's ahead there's an old farmer's shed
Now some folks like the summertime when the they can walk about
Strolling through the meadow green it's pleasant there no doubt
But give me the wintertime when the snow is on the ground
For I found her when the snow on the ground
I traced her little footprints in the snow
I found her little footprints in the snow
I bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way
For I found her when the snow was on the ground
I dropped in to see her there was a big round moon
Her mother said she just stepped out but would be returning soon
I found her little footprints and I traced them in the snow
I found her when the snow was on the ground
Now she's up in heaven she's with the angel band
I know I'm going to meet her in that promised land
But every time the snow falls it brings back memories
Shine on the one whose gone and proved untrue
Shine on the one whose gone and left me blue
It was on a moonlit night
The stars were shining bright
They whispered from on high
Your love has said goodbye
Each time I think of you I cry
I press your picture to my bosom
Then I feel that you're close by
Years have passed you've not returned dear
Now they say that you have died
But your soul will live forever
Now I know you'll be close by
I saw you last while you were leaving
The tears from you I tried to hide
You took me in your arms and said dear
Your memory I keep close by
They buried you in a lonely graveyard
And a spot they left beside
There I'll sleep till Jesus calls us
Another man has got my woman and gone
My gal went away and left me she left me with the dog gone blues
You'll never miss your water till the well runs dry
You'll never miss your water till the well runs dry
You'll never miss your woman until she says goodbye
I wish to the Lord you'd bring my woman back home
I wish to the Lord you'd bring my woman back home
Good morning captain good morning son

And I see your smiling face

Oh the people would come from far away
They'd dance all night till the break of day
You knew Uncle Pen was ready to go
Late in the evening about sundown
High on the hill and above the town
Uncle Pen played the fiddle lord how it would ring
To me that's where the fiddle begins
I'll never forget that mournful day
When Uncle Pen was called away
Shine on the one whose gone and proved untrue
Shine on the one whose gone and left me blue
It was on a moonlit night
The stars were shining bright
They whispered from on high
Your love has said goodbye
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
If I was a drunkard I tell you what I would do
I'd quit my drinking and I'd work on the building too
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
If I was a preacher I tell you what I would do
I would keep on preaching and work on the building too
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
I'm just a used to be to you
Tomorrow be another lonesome day
And I know you'll want me far away

Tomorrow be another lonesome day
And I know you'll want me far away
Gonna lay around the track

She got eyes like diamonds and her teeth shine just the same
Portland main is just the same as sunny Tennessee
Portland main is just the same as sunny Tennessee
Went down to the depot and I looked up on the board
I went down to the depot and I looked up on the board
Come go with me to yonder valley
Where we once stood beneath the tree
Where we once planned our life together
I can't forget come go with me
Come let us live some moments over
Then maybe you won't want to leave
I love you then and will forever
I can't forget come go with me
I can't forget the flowers blooming
The rose that I pick for you
Time changed you but I'm not changing
I loved you then and I still do
Come go with me to yonder valley
Where on the largest of the trees
I'll carve your name to prove I love you
I can't forget come go with me
Dark as the night and blue as the day
Dark as the night and blue as the day
It's dark outside since we've been apart
It's dark outside since we've been apart
In the shadow of the pines
Lives a girl and I know that she is mine
It's no matter where I roam
And I'll find that gal of mine
She is waiting there for me
Soon her smile I know I will see
She's all mine where I can be
Curly hair and eyes of blue
And a heart of love all for you
And I know her love is true
Arms that hold me close and tight
And lips that kiss me goodnight
And I know her love is right
Down in the willow garden where me and my love did meet
I had a bottle of burgundy wine which my true love did not know
And there I poisoned that dear little girl down by the banks below
I drew my saber through her which was a bloody knife
I threw her in the river which was an awful sight
My father often told me that money would set me free
If I would murder that dear little miss whose name was Rose Connelly
Mourning for his only son out on the scaffold high
My race is run beneath the sun the devil is waiting for me
A star fell from heaven right into my arms
A brighter star I know I've never seen
Then I found out that it was only you with all your charms
Who came into my life to fill a dream
A fallen star is what you are
The twinkle in your eyes came from the sky
You must have strayed from the milky way
A fallen star that's what you are
The heavens must be lonely now that you are mine
I'm sure they'll miss a star as bright as you
But the stars will send there blessing and brighter they will shine
I can hear the voices singing soft and low
Hallelujah I'm ready to go
In the darkness of night not a star was in site
On a highway that leads down below
But Jesus came in and saved this soul from sin
Hallelujah I'm ready to go
Sinners don't wait before it's too late
He's a wonderful Savior you know
Well I fell on my knees and he answered my pleas
And as my footsteps drew me closer
I could smell the sweet fragrance of flowers
It look like a family reunion
Had my eyes not counted the tears
And an old man sat by a graveside
I haven't seen Mary in years
Hold my hand and lead me
Lead me away from here
I just brought these flowers for Mary
I haven't seen Mary in years
When Mary and I were first married
We had such plans for our child
Like the four winds I just ran wild
If I could live our life over
I'd bring Mary such cheer
Now she's gone where she'll never meet me
I haven't seen Mary in years
Hold my hand and lead me
Lead me away from here
I just brought these flowers for Mary
I haven't seen Mary in years
Then the old man left the graveyard
I walked along by his side
I called out his name but through all his shame
Hold my hand and lead me
Lead you away from here
How could I know it was Mama
I hear a voice calling
Its coming from heaven on high
I hear a voice calling
For the land where we never shall die
He shed His life blood that the world might be free
And be ready to meet Him when He calls on that day
The savior has paid a great price for me
He gave His life on Calvary
So I'll follow His footsteps up the narrow way
I'll pay my debt on the great judgment day
Then she closed her eyes forever
Never to see us no more
Until we meet our darling
I left my old home in the mountains
And the only friends I ever had
And while I rambled this world over
My heart felt so lonely and sad
I'm going back to the old home
Back to the place I love so well
Where the sweet waters flow and the wildflowers grow
Back to the old home on the hill
I know that dear old mother's waiting
Waiting alone on that hill
With the silver in her hair and a twinkle in her eye
In the old cabin home on the hill
Years have gone by since I saw her
I've traveled many a mile
But tonight there's a light in the window
Eight weeks ago tonight we parted
It's hard to realize we're through
When we quit you said you'd always love me
Now I wonder if you feel the way I do
I'll never forget our days together
I loved you then and will forever
I wonder if you feel the way I do
It's the strangest and the sweetest love dear
That two people ever knew
You told me that I need not worry
That for ever you'd be true
It makes no difference where I wander
No matter what I say or do
And wonder if you feel the way I do
As through this dreary world I wander
My thoughts will always be of you
I'm going down this lonesome road
To see my fate or victory
God must help us there to win
I'm coming back but I don't know when
I hate to leave my mother dear
My father who is old and gray
But my true love I know you'll wait
For me to come back to me to stay
Will you be here when I come home
Or will your love fade like a rose
I could never come back should you be gone
Some Where among the hills of old Kentucky
There's two old folks I love with all my heart.
And never no more from them depart.
With her heart all filled with love divine.
I long to hold her in my arms and kiss her.
For tonight I'm old Kentucky bound.
In summer when the birds are singing sweetly
And pretty flowers blooming all around.
I long to climb that dear old rocky mountain.
For tonight I'm old Kentucky bound.
I'll soon be with the ones I love so dearly.
They'll greet me when I reach that little shanty.
Back in the days of my childhood
In the evening when everything was still
I used to sit and listen to the foxhounds
With my dad in the old Kentucky hills
I'm on my way back to the old home
The road winds on up the hill
But there's no light in the window
That shined long ago where I live
Soon my childhood days were over
I had to leave my old home
For dad and mother were called to heaven
I's left in this world all alone
High in the hills of old Kentucky
Stands the fondest spot in my memory
I'm on my way back to the old home
I wish I was in the Southland sitting in a chair
With one arm around my old guitar
And the other one around my dear
I'm rolling on through life just rolling on
Sitting in the moonlight blue as blue can be
Strumming on my old guitar
To give my poor heart ease
Whether I'm in the country whether I'm in the town
My old guitar is near me
Whether I'm up or down
Maybe I will marry if I can find a girl
But I'll always love my guitar
I'm waiting at the gate looking for my ride
Soon to take me to my home on high
Angel bands a coming From the other side
I don't want to be late I'm waiting at the gate
I can hear the thunder the time's at hand
Jesus is a coming my soul to take
Yes my Lord sees me waiting at the gate
All of my work on earth is through
I've fought the fight I've kept the faith
I hope and I pray we'll soon be together
My heart is so full it's hard not to cry
The far distant hill will make me feel blue
Soon the flowers will die don't let love die with them
And with you gone dear what will I do
Your sweet ruby lips and hair like an angel
And your mournful eyes they keep haunting me
Oh the times gone by are sweet memories
I'm trusting in you but each hour seems longer
I'm counting the days when I'll be with you
Our hearts are entwined they're blessed with the future
Everybody knows that I'm the newsboy of the town
Everybody knows that I'm the newsboy of the town
Everybody knows that I'm the newsboy of the town
We were waltzing that night in Kentucky
And I was the boy who was lucky
But it all ended too soon
As I sit here alone in the moonlight
I can see your smiling face
And I long once more for your embrace
Jack and May sweethearts were they
They were engaged to be wed
Many a promise he made her
Many a love word he said
As most lovers do they quarreled one night
She bid him not come any more
But he lingered to say at the door
Darling you know I love you to part would give me pain
Let us forget the past and make up my pet
Make up and be lovers again
Years rolled by neither was wed
All of Jack's pleading was vain
One quiet evening poor Jack was found dead
Two lives have been wrecked for she loved oh too late
She goes to his grave every day
All through life in dismay
She can't tell you why but it seems to her cry
I was lost in sin so long with no one to guide my way
My soul was in darkness had been there for many a day
In that little community church house I heard that gospel song
I went inside to kneel and pray
And prayed to my Savior
And then I felt the Holy Spirit
I knew my soul was saved in me
In that little community church house that's where we sang and prayed
We prayed to our Father to guide us on our way
All through life's long journey we'll need His helping hand
Until we reach that promised land
And prayed to my Savior
And then I felt the Holy Spirit
I knew my soul was saved in me
In that little community church house among my many friends
I can hear them praying for me and the preacher said Amen
And the vision there before me it was my Savior's face
I knew that I was saved by grace
And prayed to my Savior
And then I felt the Holy Spirit
I knew my soul was saved in me
Now come and listen to my story
A story that I know is true
A little rose that bloomed in Georgia
With hair of gold and a heart so true
Way down in the blue ridge mountains
Way down where the tall pines grow
Lives my sweetheart of the mountains
She's my little Georgia rose
Her mother left her with another
A carefree life she had planned
The baby now she is a lady
The one her mother couldn't stand
We often sing those songs together
I watched her do her little part
She smiled at me when I would tell her
Near the little old log cabin in the lane
Oh the chimney's fallen down and the roof's all caved in
And the little old log cabin in the lane
The fences have all gone to decay
And the creeks have all dried up where we used to go to mill
And things have changed their course another way
Oh I ain't got long to stay here what little time I've got
I want to rest content wile I remain
There was someone killed neath the town hall light
That the man who ran looked a lot like me
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave while the night winds wail
I spoke not a word thought it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife
The scaffold was high and eternity near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan
When the way seems dark and long
Hold to my hand dear Lord I pray
Give me grace to shout and shine
Ever in the life divine
Lord lead me on from day to day
Oh lead me on from day to day
I want to walk the holy way
Oh friends forsake me all along
I asked the Lord to lead me on
In this world of doubt and gloom
When all flowers start to bloom
Hold to my hand dear Lord I pray
I have put my faith in thee
Lord lead me on from day to day
When old age is feeling on
And my strength is almost gone
Hold to my hand dear I pray
And in heaven I'll awake
He's long gone Lost John
No hat on his head no shoes on his feet
Lost John walked around in rain
Mary grab the baby river's rising
Muddy water's taking back the land
Well this old house it won't take one more beating
Ain't no use to stay and make a stand.
The morning light showed water in the valley
Daddy's grave just went below the line
Things to save you just can't take them with you
The flood will swallow all we leave behind.
I won't be back to start all over
Mary grab the baby river's rising
Muddy water's taking back our home.
Now the road is gone there's just one way to leave here.
I'll turn my back on what I've left below
Shifting land and broken farms around me
Muddy water's changing all I know.
It's hard to say just what I'm losing
Ain't never been so all alone
Mary grab the baby river's rising
Muddy water's taking back my home.
I wrote to my girl last night
I wrote to my girl last night
But my last old dollar is done gone
Oh my last old dollar is done gone
Oh my last old dollar is done gone
Now how can a poor boy get back home
When his last old dollar is done gone
I've drank and I've rambled around
I've drank and I've rambled around
Now the time has come when I wanna go home
But my last old dollar is done gone
Now the east bound train is done run
Now the east bound train is done run
Now that train is done run and left me all alone
Nobody loves me nobody cares
If life is empty and full of tears
I long for new love searched everywhere
Nobody loves me nobody cares
Through years my heart has suffered with pain
Life's lonesome burden now I must bear
Nobody loves me nobody cares
Nights on my pillow I dream of you
Through space I gaze at the stars above
They seem to whisper from way up there
Nobody loves me nobody cares
A lonesome heart and a troubled mind
In this old world now is all I find
I look to heaven for I know there
You'll be lost in sin forever
You'd never reach the promised land
The old crossroad now is waiting
Which one are you going to take
One leads down to destruction
The other to the pearly gate
One road leads up to heaven
The other goes down below
Jesus our Savior will protect you
He'll guide you by the old crossroad
The old crossroad now is waiting
Which one are you going to take
One leads down to destruction
The other to the pearly gate
Soon your life will be over
And you'll have to face the old crossroad
Will you be ready then my brother
To shun the one goes down below
The old crossroad now is waiting
Which one are you going to take
One leads down to destruction
And home is where the heart is and he's all alone
But when he hears that steamboat whistle blow
He can feel that river in his soul
Down the Mississippi River and the Ohio
He always knows when the river's going to rise
Better get your rifles before it's too late
He's big around the middle and broad across the rump
Running ninety miles an hour taking thirty feet a jump
Ain't never been caught he ain't never been treed
And some folks say he looks a lot like me
Saved up my money and bought me some bees
Started making honey way up in the trees
Cut down the trees but the honey's all gone
Ole slew foot has done made himself at home
Winter's coming on and its forty below
River's froze over so where can he go
I got a pig at home in a pen
To feed I'm when I'm gone
Going up on a mountain
Raise a barrel of sorghum
Sweet little Liza Jane
Put that old gray bonnet
Yonder comes that gal of mine
How do you think I know
Know her by that gingham gown
Bake them biscuits baby
When you get them biscuits baked
Someone to call me their own
Please meet me tonight all alone
For I have a sad story to tell you
It's a story that's never been told
I'll be carried to the new jail tomorrow
Leaving my poor darling alone
With the cold prison bars all around me
And my head on a pillow of stone
Now I have a grand ship on the ocean
All mounted with silver and gold
And before my poor darling would suffer
Over these prison walls I would fly
And I'd fly to the arms of my darling
Someone to call me their own.
Please meet me tonight all alone.
It's a story that's never been told.
Leaving my poor darling alone.
And my head on a pillow of stone.
All mounted with silver and gold.
Over these prison walls I would fly.
Do you think of the cross on which Jesus died
Of the blood he shed for you
Are you prepared to meet him in that land of love
By his word are you going to abide
Remember the cross on which Jesus died
Follow in his footsteps each day
He shed his blood for you and he shed his blood for me
Never cast that cross aside
Never let other people lead you astray
Teach his words to them if you can
They must think of that cross on which Jesus died
And get ready to meet him someday
When Jesus comes down from heaven above
And you haven't thought of that cross
He'll cast you aside in the twinkling of an eye
Wouldn't roll so slow
If you knew what I know
I'm going to that east pay road
I'm going to that east pay road
I'm going to the one that I love best
Wouldn't roll so slow
If you knew what I know
My home in down in Tennessee
My home in down in Tennessee
That's where I want to be
Way down in sunny Tennessee
Wouldn't roll so slow
If you knew what I know
I've got a good woman just the same
I've got a good woman just the same
And I'm gonna change her name
I've got a good woman just the same
Wouldn't roll so slow
If you knew what I know
Oh shake my mother's hand for me
Oh shake my mother's hand for me
There are times I often wonder
How can all these trials be
Time can't keep me here much longer
Oh shake my mother's hand for me
Over there you'll meet my Savior
Many loved ones you will see
When you've had a talk with Jesus
My poor old heart is breaking
Since my sweet love ain't around.
Lord I think I start to ramble
Got to leave this lonesome town
I can't stay here any longer
Since my sweet love ain't around.
On that train tonight I'll leave
And don't ask me where I'm bound
This old town is way too lonely
And planted some pines in the sand
Every day I looked their way
But just couldn't understand
Why they never grew like I thought they should do
I just couldn't understand why
Now I've rambled around this wide world through
And today I just happened by
Reaching up for the clouds
I bet you wouldn't know me now.
I'll never forget the morning I left
The hum of the bees in the hay
How silent it seems here today
Surrounding the old family graves
And there's one gravestone standing all alone
There waiting to join me in the shade
Reaching up for the clouds
I walked out tonight for a ramble round
I didn't mean to stay just to view the town
When I saw her smiling from afar
As she walked into that crossroads bar
Well I walked inside and sat me down
Ordered sweet red wine and I drank it down
She came and set beside me there
I told her that I loved her true
Anything you want I'll surely do
Said a man like you don't get too far
With a girl like me at the crossroads bar
I like smoky light and a lonesome song
And I won't do right if I can do wrong
You want the moon to burn behind the darkest star
And you won't find love at the crossroads bar
Come all my friends and take my advice
Keep your love at home with your lovely wife
You're better off than you think you are
Don't let old Satan hold your hand
You'll be lost in sin forever
You'll never reach the promised land
The old crossroad now is waiting
Which one are you going to take
One leads down to destruction
The other to the pearly gate
One road leads up to heaven
The other goes down below
Jesus our savior will protect you
He'll guide you by the old crossroad
The old crossroad now is waiting
Which one are you going to take
One leads down to destruction
The other to the pearly gate
Soon this life will be over
You'll have to face the old crossroad
To shun the one goes down below
The old crossroad now is waiting
Which one are you going to take
One leads down to destruction
There's an old old house that once was a mansion
Where time's left a wreck where once was a beauty
And soon the old house will tumble down
When the leaves begin to fall in the autumn
And the raindrops drip from the trees
There's an old old man who walks in the garden
And his head is bowed in memory.
They say he built the mansion for the love of a woman
And they planned to be married in the fall
But her love withered in the last days of summer
I don't know I don't know where I'll go or what I'll do
It makes no difference what I'll do without you
Oh I love you my darling but I'll try and let you be
Well I found a bluebird high on a mountain side
Now as I sigh the hours away
I think of love of yesterday
Now I know she's gone away
She's in heaven so they say
Will the angels tell her for me
That my love will never die
Someday I'll walk along beside her
On that golden way up there
Now all my life I lived so gaily
Until she had to go away
Then she left me oh so lonely
She lies at rest beneath the clay
Each night I think about you dear
I wonder if you'll hold me then
When I meet you up in heaven
In dreams of you my body trembles
I wake up and call your name
But you're not there and I'm so lonely
Without your love I'll go insane
Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you little darling
Until the day they lay me down
I close my eyes and you're there with me
Your kiss I feel your face I see
It's not your lips now that drive me crazy
I'm waiting at the gate looking for my ride
Soon to take me to my home on high
Angel bands a coming From the other side
I don't want to be late I'm waiting at the gate
I can hear the thunder the time's at hand
Jesus is a coming my soul to take
Yes my Lord sees me waiting at the gate
All of my work on earth is through
I've fought the fight I've kept the faith
The wind is blowing cross the mountains
And out on the valley way below.
It sweeps the grave of my darling
When I die that's where I want to go.
Lord send the angels for my darling
And take her to that home on high
I'll wait my time out here on earth love
And come to you when I die.
Our names are carved upon the tombstone
I promised you before you died
Our love will bloom forever darling
When we rest side by side.
I hear a voice out in the darkness
It moans and whispers through the pines
I know it's my sweetheart a calling
Darling you often said you loved me
But you've gone on before
You don't know dear how I miss you
But we can't be darlings anymore
Darling I am sad and lonely
Since you've gone on before
So down here on this lonely earth dear
We can't be darlings anymore
Until we meet up there in heaven
And we can walk the golden shore
For down here on this lonely earth dear
We can't be darlings anymore
I have lost a million tears dear
Since you've left this world and gone
But we can never again be darlings
You'll never find another guy
That loves you more than I can do
I'll never find another girl
That pleases me more than you can do
I said goodbye to you
I said goodbye to you
I said goodbye to you
Why did you ever roam
When you know that we always were happy
All alone in our old mountain home
It was down in the old Cumberland Mountains
Down in the hills of Tennessee
As she waited alone in the moonlight
It was there that she waited for me
Oh why did you leave me little darling
Why did you leave me alone
For you knew I'd be lonely without you
All alone in our old mountain home
I hope you will always be happy
No matter where you may roam
And I long to be with you up in heaven
Little things that you do
Make me glad I'm in love with you
Little things that you say
Make me glad that I feel this way
And when I'm down you always understand
You know I love those little things in my ear that you say
When there's no one near.
Little things that you do
Let me know that your love is true
When we walk you like to hold my hand
And when we talk you tell me I'm your man
You know I love those little things that I hear
The little things you whispered in my ear
I know there ain't nobody else like you.
No one could do the little things you do.
Little things that you do
Make me glad I'm in love with you
Little things that you say
Make me glad that I feel this way
When we walk you like to hold my hand
And when we talk you tell me I'm your man
You know I love those little things that I hear
The little things you whispered in my ear.
I know there ain't nobody else like you
And I know I like her
It's kind of frightening
Maybe even might be love
Or should I ask her straight out
That smile she gave me
Don't leave too much room for doubt
Maybe even might be love
Our first kiss said more than good night
I bet I've relived it a thousand times
I can't predict what the future's gonna bring
But those looks that she's been giving me
Can only mean one thing
I think she might be the one
The best is still yet to come
Maybe even might be love
I've been looking at people
And how they change with the times
And lately all I've been seeing are people
Throwing love away and losing their minds
Or maybe it's me that's gone crazy
All these people keep hurting each other
When good love is so hard to come by
So what's the glory in living
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore
And if love never lasts forever
Then tell me what's forever for
I've been listening to people
And they say love is the key
It's not my way to let them lead me astray
It's only that I want to believe
Trying their best to survive
When in their hands is a dying romance
And they don't even try to keep it alive
So what's the glory in living
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for
And if love never lasts forever
Some kids have and some don't
And some of us are wondering why
Mom won't watch the news at night
There's too much stuff that's making her cry
But one voice was heard
Where you can ride your new bike to school
A kind of world where Mom and dad
Still believe in the golden rule
Life's not that simple
But one voice was heard
Hearts know what to say
One dream can change the world
Keep believing till you find your way
Yesterday while walking home
He pulled a pistol from his bag
And tossed it in the river below
But one voice was heard
I instantly knew when I saw you
You and I would be forever
To each other and together
There's nothing we can't do
And until the end of time
If you tell me you'll be mine
I'm never gonna spend another night
Without you in my dreams
For the rest of my life
I'm gonna reach out to you honestly and try
To give you what you need
So I'm never gonna spend another night
Without you in my dreams
But you are so in my heart
Even alone in the dark
I can feel the light of our love shining
We are so meant to be
That we are definitely destiny
And there's no denying
Though it's so cliché
There's nothing else to say
But I'm never gonna spend another night
Without you in my dreams
For the rest of my life
I'm gonna reach out to you honestly and try
To give you what you need
Never gonna spend another night
Without you in my dreams
Little bitty pretty one
Come sit down on my knee
I'll tell you a story
Happened long time ago
I've been watching you grow
He slid down the hillside and darted his tongue
He entered the garden on this bright moonlight night
Although I'm short and stocky and you're long and lean
I've got a crush on you
Then he squeezed her tighter and tighter and tighter
I've got a crush on you
And if you refuse me it would be such a shame
Then he squeezed her tighter
To excite her and delight her
I've got a crush on you
Was holding sweet green thing in his big human hand
A long jet of water shot out of her nose
I've got a secret I can't keep
I've got my eyes on something sweet
It feels like my heart's pounding through my chest
You've got a smile I can't resist
I wanna be the one that moves ya
I wanna give my heart to ya
Girl I know just what I've been missing
So open up your arms and listen
I'm the kind of guy who understands
A simple little thing like holding hands
I'll make you a promise that I'll keep
I'll get down on my knees
I know this love is real
Suitcase packed with all his things
He thought he'd found his home
But with circumstances he can't change
Waves goodbye as they pull away
From the life he's known
For the last seven months or so
We found a man who looks like you
Who cried and said he never knew
About the boy in pictures that we showed him
A rambler in his younger days
He knew he made a few mistakes
But he swore he would have been there
A million thoughts race through his mind
She could see the questions in his eyes
I will let you know what we know about
Who cried and said he never knew
About the boy in pictures that we showed him
A rambler in his younger days
He knew he made a few mistakes
But he swore he would have been there
You always said this was something that you wanted
Son it's time to meet your dad in Oklahoma
One last turn he held his breath
Till they reached the fifth house on the left
And as they pulled in to the drive
The man was waiting there outside
Wiped the worry from his eyes
Smiled and took his hand
I'm the man who looks like you
Who cried because I never knew
About the boy in pictures that they showed me
A rambler in my younger days
I know I made a few mistakes
But I swear I would have been there
Never again will you ever be alone
There's a flower in the smallest garden
Reaching for the light
There's a candle in the darkest corner
There is amazing strength In a willing hand
That you've never planned
There's a fire inside of everybody
There's a power in the faintest heartbeat
That cannot be denied
Go on and trust yourself
You can ride the wind
You're gonna take your dreams
Where they've never been
There's a hero In everybody's heart
Go on and trust yourself
You can ride the wind
You're gonna take your dreams
Where they've never been
There's a hero In everybody's heart
I'll need time to get you off my mind
Till I can make it on my own
There'll be times that you know I'll call
Chances are my tears will fall
Till I can make it on my own
Surely someday I'll look up and see the morning sun
Without another lonely night behind me
The sun is shining the grass is green
The orange and palm trees sway
There's never been such a day
But it's December the 24th
And I'm longing to be up north
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Here to stay is a new bird
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
But you can do the job
As we dream by the fire
Walking in a winter wonderland.
And pretend that he is Charlie Brown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until all the other children knock him down.
Though your nose gets a chilling
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys
And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
Although it's been said
We're following the star shining brighter
He shook his head but he pointed his hand
And he's lying in a manger down the road
I see you've traveled far bearing treasures
You say these gifts are for the new King's pleasures
I've heard that a king might come
But up till now there hasn't been one
And he's lying in a manger down the road
And he's lying in a manger down the road
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
Jingle around the clock
That's the JINGLE bell rock
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
Jingle around the clock
Rocking around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling.
You will get a sentimental
Feeling when you hear
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Everyone's dancing merrily
You will get a sentimental
Feeling when you hear
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Everyone's dancing merrily
Angels we have on heard high
Sweetly singing ore the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains
Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord the newborn King
See Him in a manger laid
While our hearts in love we raise
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
But little Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care
And take us to heaven
Ring ting tingling too
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
For a sleigh ride together with you.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
For a sleigh ride together with you.
There's a birthday party
At the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch
There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy
These wonderful things are the things
Ring ting tingling too
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
For a sleigh ride together with you.
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth
In sin and their pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
O hear the angel voices
O night when Christ was born
In grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise his holy name
O hear the angel voices
O night when Christ was born
God never made another in this world
Her eyes are shining like big blue diamonds
The last thing on my mind
When I closed my eyes
It could've been your house
The truth is I'm clueless
I can almost taste it
The last thing on my mind
When I closed my eyes
I'd never been kissed
The last thing on my mind
When I closed my eyes
The first thing on my mind
That's as far as it gets
The last thing on my mind
When I closed my eyes
The first thing on my mind
That's as far as it gets
Namesake to Elisabeth
Her daddy's pride and joy
Soon after she was born
Cause the doctor said
She'd never live to see her sweet 16
It's a miracle she beat those odds
And there's still no promise she will see tomorrow
How life can give someone so much and take so much away
And I'm so glad you came to us
You make the world a better place
With the kindness of your smile and your love
And your beauty with live on
She might not ever marry
Or hold a baby of her own
Things we all take for granted
All the things she may never know
But she believes there's always hope
And that's all she really has
So she walks through life with passion
And with dignity and class
But never for herself
She cries for everybody else
I've gotta make it to summer
I've gotta make it to summer
I know I'm gonna make her mine
I'm lost in a beach poster there on my wall
I've gotta make it to summer
In the grand scheme of things
Of life's endless song
Sung only once and then we're gone
Each breath I breathe
To share my love with those like me
The truth be known that's all we are
It's not the length of the life
Or the depth of the grave
In the end we'll be measured
By the love that we gave
In the space from end to end
It's not the length of the life
Or the depth of the grave
In the end we'll be measured
By the love that we gave
I leave with no regrets
Till I live out my time on earth
I ain't jealous of the fellas that you hang around with.
And I'm telling you one more time.
And I'm telling you one more time.
Can't you hear your heart it's talking to your brain
A little voice inside you keeps calling out her name
You start to hesitate
So why ignore an open door
When it feels that rush
When it needs that touch
A heart can't take it when
She's everything you want
You can't stop you feet from
You keep on wanting more
You think you're in control but
Who're you trying to kid
Give me one more kiss
When you're trying to deny
Yeah a heart can't take it when
Spread it's wings and fly
The wind blow through the trees
With every breath of air that I breathe
All the things I can't see
Still inside I believe
Little miracles around us everyday of our lives
The way the sun lights up the dark
The hope that I have in my heart
And as far as I can tell
Yeah God's alive and well
How that far away sun
Still makes the flowers bloom
And the joy only heaven
I am safe in the hands
Call it a little bit of luck
Or just a simple twist of faith
When we get swept up in the arms
You can feel it everyday
The woman in my life wakes me up in the morning
The woman in my life has a way of smiling
That can turn a gray sky blue
It's just like her without even trying
To make the whole world new
And she's there when I need her
In the dark I can see her
The woman in my life catches me when I've fallen
And holds me like a baby when I'm hurt
No matter how high I climb
She guides me safely back to Earth
And she's there when I need her
In the dark I can see her
The woman in my life says I'm the one she prayed for
And all she's ever gonna need
But she's the one my heart was made for
And that's the way it's always gonna be
Now I understand just why my dad
What am I going to get you girl
I wanna buy you the whole wide world
But all I got is a leather jacket and a mood ring
Sometimes I see you standing in the hall
And I can't say a thing at all
Deep inside I'm writing you poetry
I can almost feel your kiss
I almost promised my heart
With a promise that's more like a wish
But girl I can't get you out of my dreams
Yesterday I saw you on the hood of a car
With an older guy he was playing his guitar
And you gave him your smile
Should I stand up to him
Should I pick a fight
Should I get you to run away with me tonight
I don't know how to get there
The flight of a pure white dove
There's some things I know to be true snow
Snow is white and the ocean is blue
Rain is wet when it falls from the sky
And the stars come out every night
Just as sure as the sun will rise
This love is real you see in my eyes
Plant a seed and it will grow
There's some things in life I need
A place to rest when I need sleep
When I'm hungry food to eat
As sure as I need the Lord above
That's how much I need her love
And I need shelter from the cold
There's some things in life I want
To be thankful for all I've got
To still be young when I grow old
And I want all my dreams to come true
And I want to share them all with you
And I just had to tell you so
I just had to tell you so
I sleep with one eye open and
One foot on the floor and
When I see that the coast is clear
I slip right out the door
Some folks think I'm trouble
I keep one hand in my pocket
The other in the cookie jar
I'll take the whole nine yards.
I'm as innocent as I can be
A little bent on trickery
A little hide and seek
A little tongue in cheek
Before anybody says or does anything
That may hurt anyone else
Before we forever lose the blessings of songs
That grow in our hearts
Before the future slips away
Into ashes and dust of humility
Our difference is unique treasures
Innocent and trusting
Like children and lambs
Never judging or vengeful
Like the judging and the vengeful
We must celebrate the gift of life
Every day in some way
We must always remember
To play after every storm
All children are truly blessed
We all have a song in our heart
That inspires us in good times
If we take the time to listen...
Our senses help discover
We must carefully choose our words
And wants or we could
With these dangerous weapons
Strength and value of all things created
Must be measured by character
Rather than by might or by wealth...
We must heed the lessons
Through the celebrations
Or we could lose in our journey to the future
Existed with a strong spirit and an eternal mindset
To become a peacemaker for all
By sharing the things
Don't you just love the morning
When your go outside and there
Is a fresh perfect green leaf
A leaf floating from the quiet
Just resting on the grass and
Waiting to be discovered
And pick it up gently
And feel the excitement
Of a new leaf with no tears
No marks and no holes
Its is a sign of healing and future
Don't you just love the morning
When you're reminded of the
I am all skins in between
I am each age that has been
I am starving for attention
I am hardly worth the mention
I am any frame or stature
I am striving for a future
Is rainbows and purple
And the color of peace
I am dust of humble roots
I am labor of willed fruits
I am bonded to my life
I am wealth amidst strife
Is rainbows and purple
And the color of peace
I am hiding from my shame
I am yearning for a name
I am seeking my tomorrow
I am hope amid the sorrow
I am desperate for solutions
I am fate and evolutions
I am reasoned without rhymes
I am present in all times
I am seasoned by each being
Is rainbows and purple
And the color of peace
The eternity of my sadness
I wish I could have prevented it
Dream about how I could have
Lived and played with my brother
How I wish that I could have saved him
If wishing could bring him back
He'd be here with me today
But then I remember...
When I look at pictures
And imagine what he would be like
Now a dozen years old
I wish could have saved him from agelessness
If crying could bring him back
He'd be here with me today
But then I remember...
When I think of why and how
He was with us and he left us
I wish I could have prevented it
Never needing breath for birthday candles...
If wishing could bring him back
He'd be here with me today
When Jamie died we didn't understand
But I can hear it in my spirit.
It makes me fear my memory
It is something I can't see
But it can never possess me
It is something I can't see
I can defeat it if I believe it.
I have to fight it time and time
And time and time and time
The more I understand about it
The less my world revolves around it
Then I can just live out my life
If you listen carefully
You will hear soft notes
Listen with your mind
Listen with your heart
That reminds... you of
If you hear this song
And they will forever
Forever they'll remember
If you listen carefully
You will hear soft notes
Listen with your mind
Listen with your heart
Our eyes are for looking at things
But they are also for crying
When we are very happy or very sad
Our ears are for listening
But so are our hearts
Our noses are for smelling food
But also the wind and the grass and
Our hands our for feeling
But also for hugging and touching so gently
Make the world so right
Gonna paint your world to night
Thank you for the colors of the rainbow
Thank you for sharing these colors with all the fish
And all that you have given us
Make the world so right
Gonna paint your world tonight
For the colors of the
And for sharing these colors
In the people of the world
Make the world so right
Gonna paint your world tonight
For the colors of the
And for sharing these colors
In the people of the world
Makes the world so right
If they would find a cure when I'm a kid
I could go on really long nature hikes
If they would find a cure when I'm a teenager
I could dance every dance at my senior prom
If they would find a cure when I'm a young adult
I could marry and have children of my own
I could... if they would
I could... if they would
If they would find a cure when I'm grown old
I could visit exotic places and appreciate culture
And proudly share pictures of my grandchildren
If they would find a cure when I'm alive
I could... if they would
I could... if they would
If they would find a cure when I'm buried into heaven

Lots and lots of watches
I like wearing watches
Lots and lots of watches
All that I remember when I think of her back then
But struck out twice and came back to sit with me
The game got called on account of the weather
The rain came down and we huddled together
And when she walked away
I hope that I'm the cause of all that
That we're not close enough
She used to talk so loud
She was always after something
Now I wonder if it's me
But struck out twice and came back to sit with me
The game got called on account of the weather
The rain came down and we huddled together
And when she walked away
I hope that I'm the cause of all that
But struck out twice and came back to sit with me
The game got called on account of the weather
The rain came down and we huddled together
I swear no uniform ever looked better
And when she walked away
I hope that I'm the cause of all that
You never looked more beautiful
Then you look tonight
In your eyes I see all I can be
And how you changed my life
You held on when I let go
Now all I want is to let you know
Your love is like a river
That runs through my heart and soul
It's deep when I'm thirsty and warm when I'm cold
And find peace in mind time after time
You give me everything and more
When tomorrow comes I can face the morning
You can change your mind a thousand times
Your love is like a river
That runs through my heart and soul
It's deep when I'm thirsty and warm when I'm cold
And find peace in mind time after time
You give me everything and more
The sun will rise and the light will shine oh
Everything will be all right
Your love is like a river
That runs through my heart and soul
It's deep when I'm thirsty and warm when I'm cold
And find peace in mind time after time
You give me everything and more
A leopard with a harmless kid lay down
And not one savage beast was seen to frown
The wolf did with the lamb can dwell in peace
His grim carnivorous nature there did cease
And a little child was leading them in love
Long ago there was a young painter
Who had a dream that every creature came
And stood assembled by his side
And he painted the sight that had sweetened his night
For the one hundred times before he died
A kid lion and a snake and a child
And time had ceased to move
And the wolf and the lamb
Came and ate from his hand
Friend have you seen all the lines and the spaces
The colors that the old painter sees
In the peaceable kingdom that shines in the faces
Of people from more gentle times than these
I find myself adrift these days
And endless maze of ends and ways
And worlds seem so crazy to be here
But look away look away
Back or forward from today
To the visions of either fools or sears
Oh my friend have you seen all the lines and the spaces
The colors that the old painter sees
In the peaceable kingdom that shines in the faces
Of people from more gentle times than these
Such a beautiful place
Full of joy full of grace
It was bathed in our saintly yellow lie
To what learning to know that such things can't be so
He could only believe that they might
Oh my friend have you seen all the lines and the spaces
The colors that the old painter sees
In the peaceable kingdom that shines in the faces
Of people from more gentle times than these
Friend have you seen all the lines and the spaces
The colors that the young painter sees
In the peaceable kingdom that shines in the faces
When you change the way you look at things
The things you look at change
I can see the world so differently
Seeing things your way
There's a path that's right in front of me
That's been calling me for days
And I know that when you walk with me
It will be for always
You give me everything I have
You are the reason why I believe
I wanna give to you all my life
I wanna see you in my dreams
You opened up my eyes to a world I have never seen
When I see the way the early dawn drives the night away
To reveal a world that's holding on to see a brighter day
I can only hope for everyone to feel the way I do
Live their life to love someone the way I love you
You give me everything I have
You are the reason why I believe
I wanna give to you all my life
I wanna see you in my dreams
You opened up my eyes to a world I have never seen
For always I will remain faithful to the faith you have in me
Can't believe how much I have grown with you
I'm finally coming home
Through you I see the light that will take me home
All the days of my life
For always I will remain faithful to the faith you have in me
Can't believe how much I have grown with you
I'm finally coming home
When the thunder came
With our flag in flames
Everybody change the color
When the night became so dark with pain
Everyone became a brother
I came across the universe
I came across the universe
To hear a soldier cry
If you can hear me please take me out of here
And the morning light makes you wonder why
You were ever born to see it
When your body's cold it's not the story told
To the brave young souls who believe it
They came across the battlefield
And they don't know why
They came across the universe
To hear a solider cry
If you can hear me please take me out of here
We're not his friends
Though he fears the end
And he'll die for them if he had to
Rise again fall again
In the end I will come to the rescue
If you can hear me please take me out of here
When the night became so dark with pain
I could feel you reaching out for me before we ever touched
And I knew you would always be someone I could trust
I felt your presence through the good times and the bad
You kept the faith you always had
When you saw me getting nowhere
Trying to find a new direction
For a stubborn little voice that said
I didn't have a prayer
When my star began to fade
And I found the stage was bare
I looked into the wings and you were there
I felt like I was falling
Falling over the edge
And in this new altitude
I couldn't catch my breath
I turned my face to heaven
And it was then I realized
My guardian angel was here by my side
When you saw me getting nowhere
Trying to find a new direction
For that stubborn little voice that said
I didn't have a prayer
When my star began to fade
And I found the stage was bare
I looked into the wings and you were there
This song belongs to you
And you know every word is true
I always knew that I'd be lost without you
When my star began to fade
And I found the stage was bare
I looked into the wings
I looked into the wing
I looked into the wings
You and me make history
There's no two hearts like us
You can't figure it out
Well if there's any doubt
You don't want to miss
I know where I'm supposed to be
A heart beats right on time
When you're the first in line
We better catch this train
You don't want to miss
Three words that say I love you
You don't want to miss
The perfect combination of
Knocked on his door last night
He should have been there
Lord I'm worrying again
Said he messed up something real bad
Whatever it is I'll be there
Feels like he's all alone
Against the world tonight
But he's gone away Lord
Told him he's got to believe
There's a lot to believe in
Doesn't think he's good enough
Says it doesn't matter much
Well if I were walking in his shoes
Feels like he's all alone against the world tonight
But he's gone away Lord
Well I've done everything I can do
I leave it in your hands
Feels like he's all alone against the world tonight
But he's gone away Lord
Feels like he's all alone against the world tonight
But he's gone away Lord
For he's gone away Lord
I feel so different today
I have this image of you
I found the answer through you
Discovered the glory of living through you
You taught me so much
Your words lift me up
I'm all of us and a part of you
With every beat of my heart
I have this vision of you
I share my secrets with you
You taught me forgiveness with all that you do
To have someone you trust can change you so much
I'm all of us and a part of you
With every beat of my heart
I've ever been to knowing you love never ends
And even when my heart is aching
Knowing that you'll take me in
I'm all of us and a part of you
With every beat of my heart
You're flying loose and I'm losing ground with you
You know I'll wait forever if you want me to
Missed you on Sunday cause you weren't there
Saw you on Monday with purple hair
No matter what you do you'll find me there
Missing you on Sunday
Yeah I'm missing the answer to my prayers
I see you walking through the danger zone
That's not the way I used to walk you home
Don't wanna hold you back
And pray that someday you'll come back on your own
Missed you on Sunday cause you weren't there
I saw you on Monday with purple hair
No matter what you do you'll find me there
Missing you on Sunday
Yeah I'm missing the answers to my prayers
Some people say I'm such a fool to wait for you
But I can't close the gates through the heaven we once knew
Life's such a mystery
Always been clear to me
When you're around I see the sun come shining through
No matter what you do you'll find me there
Missing you on Sunday
I missed you on Sunday cause you weren't there
I saw you on Monday with purple hair
No matter what you do you'll find me there
Missing you on Sunday
Along the path that I should follow
I can see one reason why
I'm happy I can face tomorrow
No one's gonna change my mind
I'm gonna let my spirits climb
As high as I can go I feel this way because I know
That brings you down to Earth
Here in the moment with chapter and verse
Oh we talk about living life for all it's worth
It's heaven on Earth sharing my life with you
Suddenly I'm in a place
I've never been and see no danger
All you said was walk with me
And you will never be a stranger
All the world is here for me
I opened up my eyes to see it
That's the way I see it
And it's all because of you
That brings you down to Earth
Here in the moment with chapter and verse
It's heaven on Earth sharing my life with you
Sharing my life with you
Knowing heaven waits for me just clears it up for me somehow
Everything I see and hear with everything you touch it's clear
You are with me everywhere you never let me down
Cause there's something bout heaven
That brings you down to Earth
Here in the moment with chapter and verse
Oh it's all about living life for all its worth
It's heaven on Earth sharing my life with you
Oh here in the moment
There was always the voice of an angel
In the sweet lullaby of my dreams
Who would sing me a song made in heaven
That would awaken the music in me
You gave my life such meaning
Shined light upon my soul
And you were always there to hold
When I come to the end of tomorrows
And I look back on all of my days
I imagine I'm here beside you
And we're talking our usual way
Still amazed by everything
We're still amazed by everything
The simple joys that life can bring
The songs you taught me how to sing
And yes we will sing them again
In my heart they'll never end
When I'm lost I pray that I can find you
When the darkness seems to hide the light
When I'm up I know I'm flying with you
All the things I love are all because of you
You were always the one with the courage
Taught me all that I needed to know
When I needed a shoulder to cry on
You would reach out a hand I could hold
Your strength and all your kindness
And I would always try to be
I'll be the me you hoped I'd always be
Still amazed by everything
We're still amazed by everything
The simple joys that life can bring
The songs you taught me how to sing
And yes we will sing them again
In my heart they'll never end
In your eyes I always see my future
In your smile I see the reason for my ways
In your voice I know the truth has meaning
When you sing to me I hear your heart speak to me
There was always the voice of an angel
In the sweet lullaby of my dreams
Who would sing me a song made in heaven
That would awaken the music in me
Racing down the highway
On a steel horse ride
Feeling like an outlaw I'm Billy the kid
They still call me Billy the kid
I'm still wanted for what I did
The price of fame is on my head
Can't shoot down old Billy the kid
But I was born to fight
The west can be born to fight
I'll keep chasing those sunsets
With an angel riding shotgun
But I ain't buried yet
Still got bullets left
They still call me Billy the kid
I'm still wanted for what I did
The price of fame is on my head
I see her climbing my fence
She's throwing stones up at my window
She loves the midnight hour
She wants to play and that's all I need to know
I opened the door to the back porch
Barefoot on the cold floor
Didn't know where she was coming from
And it seems like the sun never goes down
When the daylight fades on this side of town
Under the southern stars
And you get so high you can't forget where you are
Wishing on a southern star
We take the long way home
That's where you find your dreams come true
Lying under the falling leaves
That's when you change your point of view
I fell in love that summer
And I tried to tell her
But just try to catch an eagle
When the daylight fades on this side of town
If you ever forget to remember
This night and all that is meant
If you ever can't see
Let me remind you again
If you ever look and can't find me
Your heart will know where I've been
And you can't feel this kiss
Let me remind you again
We'll always have this moment
It belongs to the two of us
We'll always remember
So let's make this night last forever
Who says all good things must end
And when we're old and gray
I'll still be loving you then
And I will remind you again
And when we're old and gray
I'll still be loving you then
And I will remind you again
What I want is to park this car
And wait till the cops come around
Gonna find love if we keep this up
We're gonna find love
The first time I met you
Your next kiss and your last kiss are gonna be mine
Gonna find love if we keep this up
We're gonna find love
Gonna find love if we keep this up
Those innocent eyes can't conceal
The pedal to the floor
And we're headed for heaven's door
With the keys to your heart I'm your
One little teardrop is one too much
You better watch your step
This stuff is dangerous
The pedal to the floor
And we're headed for heaven's door
With the keys to your heart I'm your
You're gonna have to walk the line
This ain't no limousine
But it can take you places
Hey clueless why you do you always do this
Do I have to go through this with you again
Whenever the nights grow colder
And you need more than another fair weather friend
Will it end before sundown
Before the prettiest girl in this town
Runs away from a showdown with me again
When you're under the covers
You think you're so strong
You know why you come around
I'm the rock you can't toss out
Don't kiss me say you're gonna miss me
Then ditch me till you come back again
Tell me how much you love me
If you're not gonna love me
Like the world's gonna end
Maybe I never told you
That I want to hold you
And never wanted to be just friends
When you're under the covers
You think you're so strong
You know why you come around
I'm the rock you can't toss out
I know you want to see me
You say you made your decision
Did you think I'd hold the door for you
I thought you knew me better than that
I won't let you turn and walk away
I won't wish you well
The way you want me to
I always admired your conviction
How you stood up for yourself
When things got rough
You always told me not to give up
I won't wish you well the way you want me to
Baby can't you tell that's just too hard to do
I'm almost over getting over you
I'm almost happy but still a little blue
I'm almost over getting over you
I know our love has ended
And we should be apart
But how can you live with
An almost mended broken heart
I know our loved has ended
And we should be apart
But how can you live with
An almost mended broken heart
I almost make it through the night
I'm ready to accept it's really true
You know I see you hiding
In your little corner of the world
Read all the poem you're writing
Who doesn't know how much
I need to feel her warm and tender touch
If you could see yourself through my eyes
You'd know that true love never lies
And you would realize how beautiful you are
If you could see yourself the way I do
You'd know that I loved you
Since the moment that you looked into my eyes
I need to tell you that the sunlight
Is always shining in your hair
And you don't even know
That in my dreams I never let you go
If you could see yourself through my eyes
You'd know that true love never lies
And you would realize how beautiful you are
Ooh how long has it been
Since somebody told you
You could hold your head up high above the rest
Just let me love you and you'll realize
How beautiful you are
If you could see yourself the way I do
You'd know that I loved you
Since the moment that you looked into
That there is still so much more
It's not hard to find
You make me all that I am
If you can tell me how
I could love you more than I do now
And I know without a doubt
I will give you all I have to give
Will never leave your side
You're the world to me
Until the last breath I take
Without you here with me
I will give you all I have to give
For as long as I live
We ain't got much money but we got enough
We got the power of young love
The stove is broken but we'll never be cold
That's the power of...
One kiss and I feel the pain
And I love the power of
We grew up together in our hometown
And then one night it happened and it didn't take much
The band played just for us and...
The old folks complain about the kids today
But they were us just yesterday
All we need is the stars above
Young blood can't be contained
Washes over me like the falling rain
Deep in the valley of our soul
Tired of worries you can't control
With so many mountains left to climb
Unanswered questions left to find
It's the first lesson learned when you're born
On the wings of angels
We ride out the storm
Pull a stranger from the water
And in that moment he's your brother
There's a gift when you receive him
Love is the greatest reason
It's the first lesson learned when you're born
On the wings of angels
We ride out the storm
Faith happens when you can't see
Against all odds you believe
It's the first lesson learned when you're born
On the wings of angels
We ride out the storm
One time in everybody's life
Like the moment we knew
You'll let it slip away
I'm dancing with a shadow
Holding on to a dream that'll never come true
Still haunted by that old love song
And my moonlight memories of you
My heart is like a ghost town
To every stranger who passes on through
Is what you left behind there
My moonlight memories of you
You thought when you left me
Then you'll ever know
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I'll never be free of
My moonlight memories of you
I'm dancing with a shadow of
My moonlight memories of you
To let you know you're on my mind
Called the one you left behind
They love the one you left behind
Ten thousand people know the words are true
But when the curtain falls
And the show is through
To the one you left behind
Ten thousand people know the words are true
But when the curtain falls
And the show is through
To the one you left behind
To the one you left behind
The color of sky is blues and grays
The color of the earth is greens and browns
The color of hope is rainbows and purple
And the color of peace is people together
The color of sky is blues and grays
The color of the earth is greens and browns
The color of hope is rainbows and purple
And the color of peace is people together
The color of sky is blues and grays
The color of the earth is greens and browns
The color of hope is rainbows and purple
And the color of peace is people together
You went to school to learn girl
Things you never knew before
And why 2 plus 2 makes 4
All you gotta do is repeat after me
Come on and love me just a little bit
I'm gonna teach you how to sing it out
Let me tell you what it's all about
Are the branches of the learning tree
But without the roots of love everyday girl
Your education ain't complete
Teacher's gonna show you
Listen to me baby that's all you got to do
Singing simple melodies
That's how easy love can be
Singing simple melodies
1 2 3 baby you and me
That's how easy love can be
Singing simple melodies
That's how easy love can be
If you're wondering what will turn your world around
Lift you up when your heart is down
By virtue of your faith
In the midst of rainy weather
Feeling like the sun will never
Shine again but oh my friend somehow
In the midst of rainy weather
Clouds don't stay forever
God can see between the trees
If you're wondering what will turn your world around
Lift you up when your heart is down
By virtue of your faith
Walking down that path alone
Circumstances not your own
Casting heavy shadows on your life
But every path will turn a corner
Every step will bring you closer
Heaven knows when you're ready you will see the light
If you're wondering what will turn your world around
Lift you up when your heart is down
By virtue of your faith
When you feel the world is just to hard to bear
Walking down that road to no where
Turn yourself around and you'll be there
By virtue of your faith
But everyday you wake up again
And the sun will shine and the clouds will start to break
When you jump in and declare your faith
If you're wondering what will turn your world around
Lift you up when your heart is down
By virtue of your faith
When you feel the world is just to hard to bear
Walking down that road to no where
Turn yourself around and you'll be there
By virtue of your faith
If I've got you it's a brand new day
Ain't nothing gonna bring me down
We stick together like crazy glue
There's no stopping us now
When you're scared and alone
And that's all you need to know
These are the reasons that we love
Against us you will see
This is a promise that I make
You can always count on me
You can always count on me
Relax if we get off track
I'll take the wheel and steer us back
And even if we don't see eye to eye
We can still share peace with the big blue sky
That's what best friends do
That's what friendship is all about
These are the reasons that we love
Against us you will see
This is a promise that I make
You can always count on me
You can always count on me
I will catch your fall when you need a hand
You can always count on me
You can always count on me
I was all right for a while
I could smile for a while
But I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
Ah you wished me well
It's hard to understand
That the touch of your hand
I thought that I was over you
I love you even more than I did before
You don't love me and I'll always be
And from this moment on
And see through angel's eyes
A place where we can fly away.
Above the moonlit sky
And see through angel's eyes
A place where we can fly away.
And see through angel's eyes
A place where we can fly away.
And see through angel's eyes
A place where we can fly away.
When the night is still
And see through angel's eyes
A place where we can fly away
Above the moonlit sky
And no place that I'd rather be
Where else can you do a half a million things
All at a quarter to three
They like it with a lot of style
But it's still that same old back beat rhythm
They say the heart of rock and roll is still beating
Now the old boy may be barely breathing
But the heart of rock and roll is still beating
Is something everyone should see
Neon lights and the pretty pretty girls
All dressed so scantily
When they play their music
They like it with a lot of flash
But it's still that same old back beat rhythm
They say the heart of rock and roll is still beating
Now the old boy may be barely breathing
But the heart of rock and roll is still beating
But it's still that some old rock and roll music
They say the heart of rock and roll is still beating
Now the old boy may be barely breathing
I've gotta get a message off to Santa today
I asked my dad and I asked my mom
Old man Santa's in a brand new age
Got a hard drive computer with a million megabytes
You've gotta get this letter ASAP
I can only find you here
Sitting in your chair
Watching the time go by
I can find you know more
Lost in your own mind
Do you dream about me
But your eyes are gray
Lost in your own mind
I'm going leave you now
Lost in your own mind
He rocks in the tree tops all day long
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet
Every little bird in the tall oak tree
Told them how to do the bob and it was grand
They started going steady and bless my soul
He rocks in the tree tops all day long
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet
Told them how to do the bob and it was grand
They started going steady and bless my soul
He rocks in the tree tops all day long
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet
Hungry every minute of the day.
Never even bat an eye.
Likes everything from soup to hay.
Bet he's gonna be a man someday.
Bread and jelly twenty times a day.
Runs both ways to all the stores.
Hungry every minute of the day
Long as he can chew it it's OK
He can eat an apple pie
And never even bat an eye
He likes everything from soup to hay
Bet he's gonna be a man someday
Bread and jelly twenty times a day
It takes lots of strength to run and play
Pulls up weeds and does the chores
And runs both ways to all the stores
He works up an appetite that way
Bet he's gonna be a man someday
You know Dasher and Dancer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Then all the reindeer loved him
And they shouted out with glee
I've gotta get a message off to Santa today
I asked my dad and I asked and I asked my mom
Old man Santa's in a brand new age
You've gotta get this letter ASAP
My first day of recess
They all laughed at me
When I fell off the swing set
And scraped up my knee
The nurse called my Momma
And when she gave me the phone
I could hear Momma say
It's where you belong
As I boarded the plane
My first job in Houston
I found a letter from Momma
And as I flew down the runway
You'll be so far away
And I'll be waiting for the day
It's best that you leave
And then turned away.
But I stopped at the door
But they're calling me away
And promise me before I go
When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest nights.
And you know wherever I am
All you have to do is call
Should turn dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind should begin to blow
Keep your head together and call my name out loud
And soon I will be knocking upon your door.
You just call out my name and you know where ever I am
I'll come running to see you again.
All you got to do is call
People can be so cold.
They'll hurt you and desert you.
Well they'll take your soul if you let them.
You just call out my name and you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again.
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend.
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend.
Your name should be Pollyanna
You brighten every day
You always bring the sunshine
Whenever you pass my way
But way down deep inside
You want to run and hide
When you need a new love
Although you smile Pollyanna
I know you're feeling blue
You laugh to hide a heartache
And it's so hard to do
But you're not fooling me
When you need a new love
Sunbeams and snowflakes
Moonlight and happy times
When she's not by my side
Long walks and rainy nights
When love just don't go right
With these heartaches and teardrops and teardrops and heartaches
Long walks and rainy nights
When love just don't go right
With these heartaches and teardrops and teardrops and heartaches
And teardrops and heartaches
It's been so long now
And it seems that it was only yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away
I hope that he's doing fine
You'd love him till the end of time
Seems like just the other day
Ain't it funny how time slips away
Guess I'll see you around
Don't know when though
Never know when I'll be back in town
That in time you're gonna pay
Down in the boondocks
Down in the boondocks
People put me down cause
That's the side of town I was born in
I love her she loves me but I don't fit in her society
Lord have mercy on the boy from down in the boondocks
Every night I watch the lights from the house up on the hill
I love a little girl who lives up there and I guess I always will
But I don't dare knock on her door
Cause her daddy is my boss man
So I have to try to be content
Just to see her when ever I can
Down in the boondocks
Down in the boondocks
That's the side of town I was born in
I love her she loves me but I don't fit in her society
Lord have mercy on the boy from down in the boondocks
Down in the boondocks
Down in the boondocks
One fine day I'll find the way to move from this old shack
I'll hold my head up like a king and I never never will look back
Until that morning I'll work and slave
And I'll save every dime
But tonight she'll have to steal away
To see me one more time
Down in the boondocks
Down in the boondocks
That's the side of town I was born in
I love her she loves me but I don't fit in her society
Lord have mercy on the boy from down in the boondocks
Lord have mercy on the boy from down in the boondocks
I knew you when you were lonely
I knew you when you were lonely
A girl all alone without love
You were sad and all alone
You didn't have anyone
That you could call your own
Your heart belonged to only me
But that was many tears ago
Now your love is just a memory
I knew you when you were lonely
I knew you when you were lonely
A girl all alone without love
We used to have a lot of fun
But someone new could offer more
Now I'm the lonely one
You were just a scared little girl
I used to be your only love
Before you came up in the world
I knew you when you were lonely
I knew you when you were lonely
A girl all alone without love
Jamie was an innocent young lady
God only knows why she gave herself
Turned your back on her
And I swore I'd get you
If the sun goes down on you
And you're still here
You're going down too
Jamie's the only thing
I ever really cared for
And she don't deserve
She's carrying a child
That you're to blame for
But you just laughed and said
Ain't no way he's gonna get your name
And I swore I'd get you
For what you're putting her through
The only reason I ain't got you
Jamie cried and begged me not to
If the sun goes down on you
And you're still here
You're going down too
You better go join the Campfire Girls
Take a few piano lessons
Buy a little doll to have for your best friend
Do all the things that little girls do
You better go start over again
Now you told me you were my girl and that I was your man
But all you did was play me for a fool
Now don't you know it's wrong to lie
And make the one who loves you cry
I wonder where you missed the Golden Rule
You must think that love's a game that you play just for fun
It must've sounded like Chinese
When you heard about the birds and bees
I never had any reason
For ambition or drive
That cared if I'm alive
But then one day she came my way
And I heard a voice within me say don't let her get away whatever you do
But I never thought that this could be
That she would ever look at me
I got to win her love for me
I grew upon the sidewalks
Got along the best I could
Mama worked all day long
I never asked for much before
But here I am at Heaven's door
Don't let her pass me by
Her love turn into sympathy
I got to win her love for me
So tired of being a nobody
Your love sets my soul on fire
You're always on my mind
You're my heart's desire
When the sun come up in the morning
When the sun go down in the evening
Your love sets my soul on fire
There ought to be a law against the way
Your love sets my soul on fire
You're always on my mind
You're my heart's desire
Don't know why I love you so
But I know that I'll never let you go
Don't know why I need your love so bad
But you're the only love I've ever had
Your love sets my soul on fire
You're always on my mind
Your love sets my soul on fire
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden
I could promise you things like big diamond rings
So you better think it over
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
So smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can
I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You'd better look before you leap still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talking about
So smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
How you got such a hold on me
First I'm up and then I'm down
Then my heart goes around and round
I bet you five dollars
I'm the only fool who will climb up a string for you
And need I say I can't break away
You control every thing I do
I used to be a swinger
Till you wrapped me round your finger
Love keeps burning like a fire in my heart now
Where I go and what I do
You build me up just to let me down
But I dare not to make a sound
So I hold on tight with all my might just to be your loving boy
No matter what they say or do
I gotta bounce right back to you now
Every dance with the guy who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
Every smile for the man who held your hand
Neath the pale moonlight
And don't forget who's taking you home
And in his arms you're gonna be
That the music's fine like sparkling wine
But while we're apart don't you give your heart to anyone
And don't forget who's taking you home
And in his arms you're gonna be
Save the last dance for me
Go and carry on till the night is gone and it's time to go
Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in his arms you're gonna be
Save the last dance for me
And in his arms you're gonna be
Save the last dance for me
First your mama and your papa sent you to the finest school
Never let it be said that their little darling was a fool
With a credit card and your good name
Your drawn like a moth to a flame
To the people of the night where you more or less lost your cool
But you're flying too high for me
And if this is how it's got to be
Then it's time to say you go your way I go mine
These are not my people
These are not my people
You find yourself naked in the world when no place to hide
Then you felt the pulse of your mind and it had died
And all you rebels that have got no cause
And all you tigers that have got no claws
But I'm inclined to think it's not the kind you mean
And your just another face in the crowd
They're gonna throw you away like last weeks magazines
These are not my people
Buys you pretty clothes and all the fine things and Heaven only knows that I wish I could
Dances and he sings and swings and says all the witty little things that a playboy should
And when you're walking arm and arm it hurts me so
But I'm going let you go
Wish the best for you
It takes the greatest love
That you'll ever find
And that's the greatest love
He's got the power to entertain you each and every hour
He's got the ways and the means to show you all the wild scenes where the lights are bright
So don't you cry and be depressed
But I just want you to know
To wish the best for you
It takes the greatest love
That you'll ever find
And that's the greatest love
There's a certain little girl that's on my mind
She's the best girl that I've ever had
And sometimes she sure makes me feel so bad
I thought I heard her calling my name now
I thought I heard her calling my name now
I need her loving and I'm not ashamed now
She's got love that's like quicksand
It only took one touch of her hand
It blew my mind and I am in so deep
I thought I heard her calling my name now
I thought I hear her calling my name now
I need her loving and I'm not ashamed now
I thought I heard her calling my name now
I need her loving and I'm not ashamed now
I could build you a house out of man made a rock
Wear sage and raise a crop
Drive across a country on a seven thirty ties
Blind like the hill and tell you some lies
I said can't manufacture the love
Said I can't manufacture the love
But I can't manufacture the love
I told the letter that I just wrote
Explaining to you that life's a joke
You think I'm your something
Said I can't manufacture the love
But you know it won't make it
You can't manufacture the love
Said you can't manufacture the love
But ya can't manufacture the love
You can't manufacture the love
Mama raised seven children
Working hard every day
Filled with sorrow and tears
Mama kept on singing a song
Mama raised up my childhood
Of that poor little shack
And how when troubles got us down
After supper we'd gather round
And mama would sing us a song
Here I am a thousand miles
The girl I loved said goodbye
Thought she meant the world to me
Life's too short for misery
So I just think I'll sing my mama's song
Crawling on the ground
He's just a little baby
Cause you crawl before you walk
What he's not used to
What he's not used to
And he's got a brother
He used to have a lover
He didn't treat her right
Now tears are falling
He didn't miss the water till the well rain dry
What he's not used to
What he's not used to
I just don't understand
I just don't understand
Some people got troubles
Some people go hungry
And sleep in the rain
Some people just ain't happy
And some people still ain't free
These people go unnoticed
But Sunday we said so proud
Feeling holier than thou
We talk about freedom
Just ain't good enough
Listen to me brothers
We better lend a helping hand
And try to love one another
Or this old world will end
But Sunday we said so proud
Feeling holier than thou
That she was someone I shouldn't know
She says that where you live
Is a place that I shouldn't go
You gotta a lot of what I need
Is down right hard to beat
We made love in the night
You showed me what it's like to be grown
Your kisses felt so right
You made my life complete
Is down right hard to beat
I'm hoping that someday
We'll find a place to stay
You made my life complete
Is down right hard to beat
Is down right hard to beat
Mary Hill used to hang out in Cherry Hill Park
The game she played lasted all day to way after dark
Now all the girls they criticized her
But all the guys just idolized her
Now in the daytime Mary Hill was a teaser
Come the night she was such a pleaser
She went away to play a one man game
And since that day it ain't been the same
As I sit beside my window
And the rain begins to fall
There's a girl that I remember
And a love that I recall
There's a letter in my pocket
I read a hundred times and it's burning a hole in my mind
Gotta get myself together
Gotta try to understand
That she's lost and gone forever
And she's found another man
But every night I think about her
As I live each moment over
Of the love we used to know
That old flame begins to grow
Then the fire keeps getting hotter
A little at a time till it's burning a hole in my mind
Don't you know it's burning a hole in my mind
If you could turn back
Would you live your life
Of all the things I wish
That never should have been
And there's one love that I
Wouldn't throw to the wind
If you had it to do again
When you're looking from a distance
And your lonely like me
It's amazing how much clearer
If you had it to do again
When you're looking from a distance
And your lonely like me
It's amazing how much clearer
Don't know why I worry and wonder
I can't help wondering
If she had it to do again
If she had it to do over again
Come and wave goodbye
I know it's gonna hurt
But you treated me like dirt
I always replay every day at home
You said you loved me just like I loved you
But find a dime in your pocket
And you're on the phone to someone new
You said you loved me just like I loved you
But find a dime in your pocket
And you're on the phone to someone new
One of us had to break
Now I do without all the things I need you for
Here we go round again
Masquerading as long lost friends
Still waters run deep
Old bridges burn slow
Old bridges burn slow
Let's chalk it all up to our youth
That's one way to hide from the truth
I never asks you for a thing and if I had you would have told me no
Still waters run deep
Old bridges burn slow
Old bridges burn slow
All my mind would allow
But now I can't break off the past and even if I knew how
I got nothing else left to say
Still waters run deep
Old bridges burn slow
Old bridges burn slow
In a way I know and I know
Still waters run deep
Old bridges burn slow
Still waters run deep
Look at those hearty out on the avenue
You're out there on your own
Spending all your time alone
This world has let you down
Nearly broke your heart
But tonight's the night for a brand new start
We'll leave this world behind
When we're walking on down the line
So meet me out on the boardwalk tonight
Meet me down by the sea
We can dance beneath the carnival lights
We'll fall in love on a carousal
Little boardwalk angel
So meet me out on the boardwalk tonight
Meet me down by the sea
We can dance beneath the carnival lights
We'll fall in love on a carousal
Little boardwalk angel
My little boardwalk angel
My little boardwalk angel
I know I can't stop loving you if I tried
I've had too many chances now I'll have to set you free
So kiss me once again and please don't cry
I promise there'll be no more alibis
I'll have to find myself a way to face this lonely day
So kiss me once again and please don't cry
I promise there'll be no more alibis
I'll have to find myself a way to face this lonely day
It's just not working
We've both known for sometime
That old fire's been out for so long
We've just stopped trying
The only time we're touching
Is when we're passing in the hall
Don't really matter at all
I might as well be leaving
I'm already out of your mind
Your dreams just might come true this time
Tomorrow when you wake up
You'll be lying here all alone
But I'll pin a note on your pillow
Or you might not even notice I'm gone
I wish that we could go back
And love like we did before
We've been alone together so long
I can't take any more
But you just go right on sleeping
My heart won't let me change my mind
I might as well be leaving
I'm already out of your mind
Your dreams just might come true this time
Tomorrow when you wake up
You'll be lying here all alone
But I'll pin a note on your pillow
Or you might not even notice I'm gone
I'll pin a note on your pillow
Or you might not even notice I'm gone
I might as well be leaving
I'm already out of your mind
Your dreams just might come true this time
Tomorrow when you wake up
You'll be lying here all alone
But I'll pin a note on your pillow
You called me and we started going out
You called me every night till you moved into my life
Now you called to say you're moving out
And they ask for some advice
You know I'd do the same for you
And I seldom have anywhere to go
I keep remembering how it was when we were in love
And how you used to call and tell me so
But now that you won't have any use for me
It would be so fine if somebody walks up to you
And they ask you for a dime
You know I'd do the same for you
Any hour of the day or the night
If you run into somebody and they look like they'd be my type
If they're sad and blue or look anything like you
You know I'd do the same thing
Look what you've done to my heart
You ran into it in the dark
I'm sure you've done some damage
Look what you've done to my heart
Look at the shape that it's in
Notice how it skips now and then
And every beat it's missing
Just needs you to start
Look what you've done to my heart
I never dreamed that I would know love
Lose my head and fall so hard
I never thought that it would show up
And look what you've done to my heart
Fell how my hands need your touch
They never needed anyone's so much
My soul could be on fire
It's just waiting for your spark
Look what you've done to my heart
It's just waiting for your spark
And love never dies at all
You don't hear a heart break in the middle of the night
But you sure do feel the pain
And you can't see a teardrop fall in the pouring rain
If you lie about your feelings
If the skies are clear and you can't see a cloud
Will you stay inside again
Cause you can't see a teardrop fall in the pouring rain
Hide the tears in my eyes
Can't seem to forget you
Even though you're not around
Can I hide my heart so well
That it can't be found
Don't wanna fall again with somebody new
Cause your love still remains
Hide the tears in my eyes
Hide the tears in my eyes
Don't need no money to qualify
And don't bring your checkbook
Bring your broken heart
They say you lost your woman
Say you lost your man
And it's members only tonight
There throwing a party
And it's members only tonight
Don't need no money to qualify
Don't bring your checkbook
They say you lost your woman
They're having a little party for the brokenhearted
And it's members only tonight
There throwing a party
And it's members only tonight
They're having a heartache
But there's just one thing that I think you should know
When love is on the line and you're having doubts
It's not who's on your mind
It's who's in your heart that counts
So take a long look at your friend
Make sure she's worth the end
Of a love we built together from the ground
Though you're flying high you'll have to land some time
And it's not who's on your mind
It's who's in your heart that counts
You know that it's true
So take a long look at your friend
Make sure she's worth the end
Of a love we built together from the ground
And it's not who's on your mind
It's who's in your heart that counts
It's who's in your heart that counts
Take a long look at your friend
Make sure she's worth the end
Of a love we built together from the ground
Though you're flying high you'll have to land some time
You took all your possessions
The day you disappeared
There's nothing to remind me
That you were ever here
So why can't I forget you
Why do I keep looking for you
Out of sight and on my mind
Your memory's always with me
Like a shadow in the night
That I can't leave behind
Got a feeling that these feelings
Ain't never gonna die
And you're gonna stay forever
Out of sight and on my mind
Haven't asked our friends about you
I don't call you on the phone
I never drive by that new place
That you're now calling home
That I should wanna see
But I still turn each corner
Hoping you'll run into me
Out of sight and on my mind
Your memory's always with me
Like a shadow in the night
That I can't leave behind
Got a feeling that these feelings
Ain't never gonna die
And you're gonna stay forever
I cry myself to sleep each night
Wishing I could hold you tight
Life seems so empty since you went away
The pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my lonely tears instead
Every minute of the day
Every hour you're away
I don't think I can go on
They say a man should never cry
But when I see you passing by
My heart breaks down and cries a million tears
You broke my heart and set me free
But you forgot your memory
Every minute of the day
Every hour you're away
I don't think I can go on
She's got a new look on her face
I only wish it meant good news
And my heart is aching and I'm shaking in my shoes
She don't cry like she used to
She no longer walks the floor
She don't ask me where I'm going
When I'm going out the door
Like she's always done before
She don't cry like she used to anymore
She don't cry like she used to anymore
If only she would hold me in her arms tonight
And tell me how her heart aches when I'm gone
Even if she'd scold me for staying out all night
But she don't cry like she used to
She no longer walks the floor
She don't ask me where I'm going
When I'm going out the door
Like she's always done before
She don't cry like she used to anymore
She don't cry like she used to anymore
Now I'm the one who's breaking down
The one who walks the floor
She don't cry like she used to anymore
That old gray sky has started to rain
And loneliness growing as the music plays
I'm gonna find a place for the heartache
A place I can leave my blues behind
I'm gonna find a place for the heartache
It's been too late so long for you and me
And it's so hard turning lose from all our dreams
When they were so close we could almost see
I'm gonna find a place for the heartache
A place I can leave my blues behind
I'm gonna find a place for the heartache
I'm gonna find a place for the heartache
Something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
And I'm not a little boy
Don't play with my heart
But if you want me to love you
Let your conscience be your guide
But I know deep down inside of me
I believe you love me
Forget your foolish pride
Life is too short to have sorrow
You may be here today and gone tomorrow
You might as well get it while you want
I'm nothing to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
But I tell it like it is
My time is too expensive
And I'm not a little boy
But I tell it like it is
I'm nothing to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
This is something I hate to do
We've been meeting here so long
I guess what we've done is all wrong
Let's just kiss and say goodbye
Many months have passed us by
I've got ties and so do you
I just think this is the thing to do
Maybe you'll meet some other guy
Let's just kiss and say goodbye
Let's just kiss and say goodbye
Tell me you would try to slip away somehow
When you still involve it
Let me tell you how sweet it is
Now I know it's wrong
The things I ask you to do
But please believe me darling
I don't mean to hurt you
But can you slip away
Without him knowing you're gone
Baby we could meet somewhere
Somewhere we both are not known
I feel a deep burning inside
At first it seemed as if his dreams had all come true
And losing his heart was such an easy thing to do
He fell in love so deep with magic that they had
But when he realized he couldn't hold her
It finally drove him mad
Now he don't know when he lost her
He don't know that she's not there
And he don't know that it's over
Best of all he don't know that she don't care
Now he shows her old photograph to each new friend he finds
The writing on the back has long since faded out with time
But his heart remembers every word and his eyes still see the love
And in his mind he's still the one that she is dreaming of
Now he don't know when he lost her
He don't know that she's not there
And he don't know that it's over
Best of all he don't know that she don't care
I know I broke my promise to you
I betrayed your trust in me
I gave in to temptation
I was too blinded to see
That you were all I ever needed
Cross my heart and hope to try
I've learned my lesson well this time
I'll never tell another lie
This time it's do or die
Cross my heart and hope to try
I'll never break your heart again
And though I've taken you for granted
Please don't give up on me yet
Cross my heart and hope to try
I've learned my lesson well this time
I'll never tell another lie
This time it's do or die
I've learned my lesson well this time
I'll never tell another lie
This time it's do or die
Cross my heart and hope to try
I'll never tell another lie
This time it's do or die
Your hand was shaking
My heart was breaking
On that lonely night we said goodbye
But you touched my shoulder
And I saw that teardrop fall from your eye
But I dream about you
And nothing could ever take that from me
And though I can't touch you
That love has no right
It's been twenty four hours
Since you walked away
If I knew where to call you
I know just what I'd say
And I know that I went too far this time
I should have been more careful
With your tender heart
When I said all those mean things
Words that tore you apart
Make everything right
Let's not fight it anymore
Unpack your bags and close the door
Though you lied right from the start
I can't convince my foolish heart
You've got two good men strung out
And there's not the slightest doubt
That other men have loved you before
But you drew your face away
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore
If I had one ounce of pride
I'd stand up or step aside
So I'll accept the crumbs you drop
Let him speak up for themselves
Knocking on your door
But you do your thing so well
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore
I'm too far gone to turn around
And pick myself up off the ground
Now one of us must win or lose
While you're making up your mind
I'll be praying all the time
Praying that you'll never let me go
But you do your thing so well
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
I should have noticed this when
You started turning up in sad songs
It should have hit me when
You began to sing along
I should have realized when
There were tears in your eyes
Every time a song was through
It was more than the music
I should have seen it when
And you'd sleep on the couch
Instead of sleeping next to me
When I'd wake up in the night
Sometimes I'd hear you cry
It was more than the movies
I wish you had screamed
And yelled out the things you held deep inside
That our love was dying right before my eyes
But I should have felt it on
Those too few nights I held you
All those whispers weren't true
There was a reason why you never looked in my eyes
And it breaks my heart in two
When you were making love to me
When you were making love to me
He won't be meeting you
Being the one left behind
And I heard he even told you that he was untrue
Being on the outside looking in
Remember when I needed you so bad
Remember what you had to say
You told me that I should find another shoulder to cry on
You laughed and ya walked away
But I've found somebody new
It's just starting for you
Love is a full time job
It's good work if you can find it
It's not for the faint of heart
Cause you could get hurt or blinded
It's not a part time feeling
And not for the single minded
Love is a full time job
It's good work if you can find it
Walking through my mind
Reflecting on my failures
I hope to God this time
I've learned to do it better
And fallen in love again
And I don't care what it takes
I'll even put a little overtime in it
Love is a full time job
It's good work if you can find it
It's not for the faint of heart
Cause you could get hurt or blinded
It's not a part time feeling
And not for the single minded
Love is a full time job
It's good work if you can find it
The passion in your kiss
Brings more to me than pleasure
It reminds me of this
That's love's the only treasure
Don't you know how good it feels
To be with you tonight
After all these years of trying
Love's finally gonna turn out right
Love is a full time job
It's good work if you can find it
It's not for the faint of heart
Cause you could get hurt or blinded
It's not a part time feeling
Not for the single minded
Love is a full time job
It's good work if you can find it
Love is a full time job
It's good work if you can find it
It's not for the faint of heart
Cause you could get hurt or blinded
It's not a part time feeling
And not for the single minded
It's good work if you can find it
Love is a full time job
It's good work if you can find it
It's not for the faint of heart
Cause you could get hurt or blinded
It's not a part time feeling
Not for the single minded
Love is a full time job
It's good work if you can find it
Love is a full time job
It's good work if you can find it
It's not for the faint of heart
Cause you could get hurt or blinded
It's not a part time feeling
And not for the single minded
I told you that I'm sorry over and over
But I'm still not getting through
I've got to win you back somehow
If I have to turn this whole world upside down
I've looked high and low everywhere I know
Trying to find my way back to you
Someways to bring you home back where love belongs
Tell me how do I get through to you
My heart's on the line
I still can't change your mind
Don't you think that I've heard enough
Tell me that I haven't lost your sweet love
I've looked high and low everywhere I know
Trying to find my way back to you
Someways to bring you home back where love belongs
Tell me how do I get through to you
I've looked high and low everywhere I know
Trying to find my way back to you
Someways to bring you home back where love belongs
Tell me how do I get through to you
And I'm fool enough to fall for the same old line
I won't follow my heart to wherever you are
I'll try not to do it
But there'll be a quarter in a pay phone
And a finger on a touch tone
Before the night is over
I'll just smile and pretend that it's all right
But I'll leave you alone if it takes all night
I'll try not to do it
But there'll be a quarter in a pay phone
And a finger on a touch tone
Before the night is over
Would it hurt more not to have you
Or hurt more to be without you
But when it comes down to it
I just know I'm gonna do it
There'll be a quarter in a pay phone
And a finger on a touch tone
With you lying in my arms
I pictured every movement
But we've stumbled over things to say
That should come easily
Now we're somewhere between friends and lovers
We're just pieces in a puzzle
And we're trying hard to fit
And I'm afraid we're doing damage
And I'm laying here wondering
Now we're somewhere between friends and lovers
Every day begins the same
I call in sick so they won't forget my name
I stare at the strangers out in the street
My friends are scared of what I might do next
But it's the same routine since the day you left
There's a method to my sadness
A certain style to my blues
I can't afford to let a day go by
I keep track of all the memories
There isn't one I want to lose
There's a method to my sadness
Making the most of losing you
I talk to your pictures by my bed
Got a list of things I wish I'd said
I dial your number when I know you won't be home
I'm doing everything I know how to do
There's a method to my sadness
A certain style to my blues
I can't afford to let a day go by
I keep track of all the memories
There isn't one I want to lose
There's a method to my sadness
Making the most of losing you
There's a method to my sadness
When I was all you longed to hold
Ain't it funny how things change
But I'll be here where you left me
Standing in the pouring rain
Just a prisoner of my pain
And begging you to free me
Like the day you left me behind
And if you ever change your mind
And you know I always will
So I'll be here where ya left me
Standing in the pouring rain
Just a prisoner of my pain
And begging you to free me
Like the day you left me behind
And if you ever change your mind
Right here where ya left me
Now I'm just a prisoner
And if you ever change your mind
Ya can come on and free me
So if you ever change your mind
We once were up close now we couldn't be farther apart
From better to worse there's two separate worlds
Where there used to be one heart
When love finally finished and feelings diminished
It was sad to watch how we'd changed
From lover to lover just holding each other to blame
From lover to lover where did the caring go
Now pictures in a photo album are all that we've got to show
From cover to cover the beginning to the end
From lover to lover to not even being friends
But life goes on and we only get one time around
It's been too long to know who was wrong
And I guess it don't matter now
From her man and his woman to nothing in common
Except in our last names
From lover to lover just holding each other to blame
From lover to lover where did the caring go
Now pictures in a photo album are all that we've got to show
From lover to lover to not even being friends
So I decided I'd drop you a line
Just to let you know I think I'm losing my mind
I can't believe what this is doing to me
Looks like your memory just won't let me be
How could you leave me with a broken heart
Walking in circles in need of a friend
This is the saddest I guess I've ever been
I know someday I've got to make up my mind
Forget the past and leave it all behind
Right now that's something that I just can't do
Your love is one thing I thought I'd never lose
How could you leave me with a broken heart
This is the saddest I guess I've ever been
When I found you I was searching for myself
For you were slowly leaving someone else
We were in that same old state of mind
And we helped each other leave the past behind
At first it all seemed too good to be true
And we tried our best and did all we could do
And a smile can't wipe away the tears inside
It can lift you up and let you down
While it helps you get your feet back on the ground
We made when we believed that we would try
And we held on never dreaming the dream would die
You brought me back and taught me things I'd never chanced to see
And I hope you'll always smile when you think of me
It can lift you up and let you down
While it helps you put your feet back on the ground
But it was stronger than the kind that lasts
It can lift you up and let you down
While it helps you get your feet back on the ground
Lately she's found the strength to go out
It hasn't been long since love went wrong
There's no diamond on her finger
Just a lingering memory
And a ring where a ring used to be
There's a ring where a ring used to be
She's still chained to the man who set her free
The circle that would join them for all eternity
You think you know her well enough
You've got to go slow
The closer and you'll see
There's a ring where a ring used to be
She's still chained to the man who set her free
The circle that would join them for all eternity
I know where you've been
You can't hide it no longer
I been hearing from friends
That you've been unfaithful
But I'll give you one chance to save our romance
You better make up your mind
I'll ask one more time
How much will it take
Till you finally learn
Your lesson in love is taking it's turn
Do ya tell him the same things
Ya don't wanna hurt me
That ya just need some time
Before ya pack up and leave
You better make up your mind
I'll ask one more time
Till you finally learn
Your lesson in love is taking it's turn
If the jukebox took teardrops
I'd dance all night long
I'd sail away to yesterday
On the wings of a song
Till the blue light of dawn
If the jukebox took teardrops
I'd cry all night long
And I got a feeling she's gone to stay
She said she needed money
Now both my little honey and my money are gone
If the jukebox took teardrops
It would play a hurting song
If the jukebox took teardrops
I'd cry all night long
Just let me spend the evening
Missing her and wishing her back once more
If the jukebox took teardrops
I'd dance all night long
I'd sail away to yesterday
On the wings of a song
Till the blue light of dawn
If the jukebox took teardrops
I'd cry all night long
If the jukebox took teardrops
Down in the boondocks
Down in the boondocks
People put me down cause
That's the side of town I was born in
I love her she loves me but I don't fit in her society
Lord have mercy on the boy from down in the boondocks
Every night I watch the lights from the house up on the hill
I love a little girl who lives up there and I guess I always will
But I don't dare knock on her door
Cause her daddy is my boss man
So I have to try to be content
Just to see her when ever I can
Down in the boondocks
Down in the boondocks
That's the side of town I was born in
I love her she loves me but I don't fit in her society
Lord have mercy on the boy from down in the boondocks
Down in the boondocks
Down in the boondocks
One fine day I'll find the way to move from this old shack
I'll hold my head up like a king and I never never will look back
Until that morning I'll work and slave
And I'll save every dime
But tonight she'll have to steal away
To see me one more time
Down in the boondocks
Down in the boondocks
That's the side of town I was born in
I love her she loves me but I don't fit in her society
Lord have mercy on the boy from down in the boondocks
Lord have mercy on the boy from down in the boondocks
I knew you when you were lonely
I knew you when you were lonely
A girl all alone without love
You were sad and all alone
You didn't have anyone
That you could call your own
Your heart belonged to only me
But that was many tears ago
Now your love is just a memory
I knew you when you were lonely
I knew you when you were lonely
A girl all alone without love
We used to have a lot of fun
But someone new could offer more
Now I'm the lonely one
You were just a scared little girl
I used to be your only love
Before you came up in the world
I knew you when you were lonely
I knew you when you were lonely
A girl all alone without love
I never had any reason
For ambition or drive
That cared if I'm alive
But then one day she came my way
And I heard a voice within me say don't let her get away whatever you do
But I never thought that this could be
That she would ever look at me
I got to win her love for me
I grew upon the sidewalks
Got along the best I could
Mama worked all day long
I never asked for much before
But here I am at Heaven's door
Don't let her pass me by
Her love turn into sympathy
I got to win her love for me
So tired of being a nobody
It's a good time for you to hold me tight
It's a good time and I feel all right
I got a ten dollar bill
It's a good time to have a good time with me
It's a good time for you to feel that beat
It's a good time for you to move your feet
Tell your mama that you're gonna spend a night with a friend
Cause there's no telling when you might be in
What a night to really get right
It's a good time for you to dance and sing
It's a good time for most anything
You know it can't go wrong
Tell your mama that you're gonna spend a night with a friend
Cause there's no telling when you might be in
What a night to really get right
It's a good time for you to dance and sing
It's a good time for most anything
You know it can't go wrong
Your love sets my soul on fire
You're always on my mind
You're my heart's desire
When the sun come up in the morning
When the sun go down in the evening
Your love sets my soul on fire
There ought to be a law against the way
Your love sets my soul on fire
You're always on my mind
You're my heart's desire
Don't know why I love you so
But I know that I'll never let you go
Don't know why I need your love so bad
But you're the only love I've ever had
Your love sets my soul on fire
You're always on my mind
Your love sets my soul on fire
You better go join the Campfire Girls
Take a few piano lessons
Buy a little doll to have for your best friend
Do all the things that little girls do
You better go start over again
You said I was your only boy
But you sure lead me wrong
I found out you just played me for a fool
Now don't you know it's wrong to lie and make the one who loves you cry
I wonder where you missed the golden rule
You better go join the Campfire Girls
Take a few piano lessons
Buy a little doll to have for your best friend
Do all the things that little girls do
You better go start over again
I thought you knew like everyone that love's a sacred thing
And not a game to play with every boy
But you thought it was funny
When you put me down for him
To you my heart was just another toy
You better go join the Campfire Girls
Take a few piano lessons
Buy a little doll to have for your best friend
Do all the things that little girls do
You better go start over again
You better go join the Campfire Girls
Take a few piano lessons
Buy a little doll to have for your best friend
How you got such a hold on me
First I'm up and then I'm down
Then my heart goes around and round
I bet you five dollars
I'm the only fool who will climb up a string for you
And need I say I can't break away
You control every thing I do
I used to be a swinger
Till you wrapped me round your finger
Love keeps burning like a fire in my heart now
Where I go and what I do
You build me up just to let me down
But I dare not to make a sound
So I hold on tight with all my might just to be your loving boy
No matter what they say or do
I gotta bounce right back to you now
Everything turned blue
Everything turned blue
All my nights are blue
Since I lost you I don't know what to do with myself
I don't want nobody else
Take away these shades of blue
Everything turned blue
Everything turned blue
Buys you pretty clothes and all the fine things and Heaven only knows that I wish I could
Dances and he sings and swings and says all the witty little things that a playboy should
And when you're walking arm and arm it hurts me so
But I'm going let you go
Wish the best for you
It takes the greatest love
That you'll ever find
And that's the greatest love
He's got the power to entertain you each and every hour
He's got the ways and the means to show you all the wild scenes where the lights are bright
So don't you cry and be depressed
But I just want you to know
To wish the best for you
It takes the greatest love
That you'll ever find
And that's the greatest love
First your mama and your papa sent you to the finest school
Never let it be said that their little darling was a fool
With a credit card and your good name
Your drawn like a moth to a flame
To the people of the night where you more or less lost your cool
But you're flying too high for me
And if this is how it's got to be
Then it's time to say you go your way I go mine
These are not my people
These are not my people
You find yourself naked in the world when no place to hide
Then you felt the pulse of your mind and it had died
And all you rebels that have got no cause
And all you tigers that have got no claws
But I'm inclined to think it's not the kind you mean
And your just another face in the crowd
They're gonna throw you away like last weeks magazines
These are not my people
There's a certain little girl that's on my mind
She's the best girl that I've ever had
And sometimes she sure makes me feel so bad
I thought I heard her calling my name now
I thought I heard her calling my name now
I need her loving and I'm not ashamed now
She's got love that's like quicksand
It only took one touch of her hand
It blew my mind and I am in so deep
I thought I heard her calling my name now
I thought I hear her calling my name now
I need her loving and I'm not ashamed now
I thought I heard her calling my name now
I need her loving and I'm not ashamed now
And the world has got you down
In the middle of the night
When you need somebody
To make everything right
Don't you be ashamed to call my name
Don't you be ashamed to call my name
I can still recall the little tomboy
Seems like only yesterday
Even then you were my pride and joy
In the middle of the night
When you need somebody
To make everything right
Don't you be ashamed to call my name
You cannot see electricity up on a power line
Tell ya just the way I feel
Don't let the world get you uptight
In the middle of the night
When you need somebody
To make everything right
Don't you be ashamed to call my name
In the middle of the night
When you need somebody
To make everything right
Don't you be ashamed to call my name
Don't you be ashamed to call my name
In the middle of the night
When you need somebody
To make everything right
Don't you be ashamed to call my name
Don't you be ashamed to call my name
In the middle of the night
To make everything right
Don't you be ashamed to call my name
You've got your world
Running through the rain
And girl it's too late
And start all over again
Running through the rain
How happy we would be
Were storybook children
Running through the rain
A foot on the land and the other foot out on the high seas
My old friend Gabriel stands with a smile on his face and a horn in his hand
And he looks as though he wants to play me a tune
Come on down to Atlanta and blow your horn
Come on down to Atlanta and blow your horn
You know the crowd's running wild
And I feel like a motherless child
Just a little more time to get my people together
Come on down to Atlanta and blow your horn
Time to blow your horn
Come on down to Atlanta and blow your horn
And I know you got a gig to do
But just a little more time to get my people together
I've got to have more time now
Preachers shop while sinners sin and old ladies cry
Turning water into wine
And they throw your pearls before the swine
And yet you trust them not to bust your balloon
So let me skip a page
And wake up in a new age
And the sun will be my shadow at high noon
Come on down to Atlanta and blow your horn
Come on down to Atlanta and blow your horn
At the corner of 14th and Peachtree
Just a little more time to get my people together
Just a little more time
Come on down to Atlanta and blow your horn
Come on down to Atlanta and blow your horn
And if the time is right
My soul is going to take its flight
Just a little more time to get my people together
Come on down to Atlanta and blow your horn
You gotta blow your horn
Come on down to Atlanta and blow your horn
You know the crowd's running wild
And I feel like a motherless child
Just a little more time to get my people together
I wanna have more time
Come on down to Atlanta and blow your horn
Come on down to Atlanta and blow your horn
Nobody loves you but me
With lovely promises he'll whisper
But through the glitter of it all
I think you're gonna see
Nobody loves you but me
Nobody cares the way I do
Nobody loves me but you
We shared the good times
But if you stopped and count them all
I'm sure you will agree
Nobody loves you but me
Mary Hill used to hang out in Cherry Hill Park
The game she played lasted all day to way after dark
Now all the girls they criticized her
But all the guys just idolized her
Now in the daytime Mary Hill was a teaser
Come the night she was such a pleaser
She went away to play a one man game
And since that day it ain't been the same
My life's been changed and rearranged
Don't do the things I used to do
I spend my days in such misery
My life's turning out to be
God knows it's so wrong for me to be
Every day I lean on a lamp post
Every night I lay on a pillow
And every morning brings a new day
And every night that day is through
But tonight I just wanna stay in
Every day I don't wanna get up
Every night I just wanna go out
And every night I want to stay out
